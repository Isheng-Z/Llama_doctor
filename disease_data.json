        "disease": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm",
        "description": "An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a swelling (aneurysm) of the aorta – the main blood vessel that leads away from the heart, down through the abdomen to the rest of the body.\nThe abdominal aorta is the largest blood vessel in the body and is usually around 2cm wide – roughly the width of a garden hose. However, it can swell to over 5.5cm – what doctors class as a large AAA.\nLarge aneurysms are rare, but can be very serious. If a large aneurysm bursts, it causes huge internal bleeding and is usually fatal.\nThe bulging occurs when the wall of the aorta weakens. Although what causes this weakness is unclear, smoking and high blood pressure are thought to increase the risk of an aneurysm.\nAAAs are most common in men aged over 65. A rupture accounts for more than 1 in 50 of all deaths in this group.\nThis is why all men are invited for a&nbsp;screening test when they turn 65. The test involves a simple ultrasound scan, which takes around 10-15 minutes.\nIn most cases, an AAA causes no noticeable symptoms. However, if it becomes large, some people may develop a pain or a pulsating feeling in their&nbsp;abdomen (tummy)&nbsp;or persistent back pain.\nAn AAA doesn’t usually pose a serious threat to health, but there’s a risk that a larger aneurysm could burst (rupture).\nA ruptured aneurysm can cause massive internal bleeding, which is usually fatal. Around 8 out of 10 people with a rupture either die before they reach hospital or don’t survive surgery.\nThe most common symptom of a ruptured aortic aneurysm is sudden and severe pain in the abdomen.\nIf you suspect that you or someone else has had a ruptured aneurysm, call 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance.\nIt&#8217;s not known exactly what causes the aortic wall to weaken, although increasing age and being male are known to be the biggest risk factors.\nThere are other risk factors you can do something about, including smoking and having high blood pressure and cholesterol level.\nHaving a family history of aortic aneurysms also means that you have an increased risk of developing one yourself.\nBecause AAAs usually cause no symptoms, they tend to be diagnosed either as a result of screening or during a routine examination – for example, if a GP notices a pulsating sensation in your abdomen.\nThe screening test is an&nbsp;ultrasound scan,&nbsp;which allows the size of your abdominal aorta to be measured on a monitor. This is also how an aneurysm will be diagnosed if your doctor suspects you have one.\nIf a large AAA is detected before it ruptures, most people will be advised to have treatment, to prevent&nbsp;it rupturing.\nThis is usually done with surgery to replace the weakened section of the blood vessel with a piece of synthetic tubing.\nIf surgery is not advisable – or if you decide not to have it – there are a number of non-surgical treatments that can reduce the risk of an aneurysm rupturing.\nThey include medications to lower&nbsp;your cholesterol and blood pressure, and quitting smoking.\nYou will also have the size of your aneurysm checked regularly with ultrasound scanning.\nThe best way to prevent getting an aneurysm – or reduce the risk of an aneurysm growing bigger and possibly rupturing – is to avoid anything that could damage your blood vessels, such as:\n- smoking\n- eating a high-fat diet\n- not exercising regularly\n- being overweight or obese\nRead more about screening for an AAA.\nIn most cases, an unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) will cause no symptoms, unless it becomes particularly large.\nSymptoms of an unruptured AAA may include:\n- a pulsating feeling in your stomach (abdomen), usually near your belly button, that&#8217;s usually only noticeable when you touch it\n- persistent back pain\n- persistent abdominal pain\nIf you have any of the symptoms above, you should see your GP as soon as possible.\nIf your aortic aneurysm ruptures, you will feel a sudden and severe pain in the middle or side of your abdomen. In men, the pain can also radiate down into the scrotum.\nOther symptoms include:\n- dizziness\n- sweaty and clammy skin\n- rapid heartbeat (tachycardia)\n- shortness of breath\n- feeling faint\n- loss of consciousness\nA ruptured aortic aneurysm is a medical emergency, and it’s important to get to hospital as soon as possible.\nAround 80% of people with a rupture die before they reach hospital or don’t survive emergency surgery.\nThis is why the&nbsp;NHS AAA Screening Programme was introduced, so dangerously large aneurysms can be treated before they burst.\nIf you suspect that you or someone in your care has had a ruptured aneurysm, call 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance.\nThe aorta is the largest blood vessel in the body. It transports oxygen-rich blood away from the heart to the rest of the body.\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) occurs when part of the aorta wall becomes weakened and the large amount of blood that passes through it puts pressure on the weak spot, causing it to bulge outwards to form an aneurysm.\nThe abdominal aorta is usually around 2cm wide – about the width of a garden hosepipe &nbsp;– but can swell to over 5.5cm, which is what doctors classify as a large aneurysm.\nIt&#8217;s not known exactly what causes the aortic wall to weaken, although increasing age and being male are known to be the biggest risk factors.\nOne study found that people aged over 75 are seven times more likely to be diagnosed with an AAA than people under 55 years old.\nMen are around six times more likely to be diagnosed with an AAA than women.\nHowever, there are other risk factors that you can do something about – described below – the most important of which is smoking.\nResearch has found that smokers are seven times more likely to develop an AAA than people who have never smoked.\nThe more you smoke, the greater your risk of developing an AAA. People who regularly smoke more than 20 cigarettes a day may have more than 10 times the risk of non-smokers.\nThe risk may increase because tobacco smoke contains harmful substances that can damage and weaken the wall of the aorta.\nAtherosclerosis&nbsp;is a potentially serious condition where arteries become clogged up by fatty deposits, such as cholesterol.\nAn AAA is thought to develop because these deposits (called plaques) cause the aorta to widen in an attempt to keep blood flowing through it. As it widens, it also gets weaker.\nSmoking, eating a high-fat diet and high blood pressure all increase your risk of developing atherosclerosis.\nAs well as contributing to atherosclerosis,&nbsp;high blood pressure (hypertension) can place increased pressure on the aorta&#8217;s wall.\nHaving a family history of AAAs means that you have an increased risk of developing one.\nOne study found that people who had a brother or sister with an AAA were eight times more likely to develop one than people whose siblings were unaffected.\nThis suggests that certain genes you inherit from your parents may make you more vulnerable to developing an AAA.\nHowever, no specific genes have yet been identified.\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) usually causes no symptoms. Therefore, they tend to be diagnosed as a result of screening, or during a routine physical examination when a GP notices a distinctive pulsating sensation in your abdomen.\nA diagnosis can be confirmed using an ultrasound scan. Ultrasound can also determine the size of the aneurysm, which is an important factor in deciding on a course of treatment.\nAll men in the UK who are 65 or over are offered an&nbsp;ultrasound scan to check for AAAs.\nAll men should receive an invitation in the year they turn 65 years old. Men who are older than 65 can refer themselves for screening by contacting their local NHS AAA screening service.\nFor more information, visit our page on&nbsp;AAA screening.\nTreatment for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) depends on several factors, including the aneurysm&#8217;s size, your age and general health.\nIn general, if you have a large aneurysm (5.5cm or larger) you will be advised to have surgery, either to strengthen the swollen section of the aorta or to replace it with a piece of synthetic tubing.\nThis is because the risk of the aneurysm rupturing is usually greater than the risk of having it repaired.&nbsp;\nIf you have a small (3.0-4.4cm) or medium (4.5-5.4cm) aneurysm, you will be offered regular scans to check its size.\nYou will also be given advice on how to slow its growth and reduce the risk of it rupturing&nbsp;–&nbsp;for example, stopping smoking – and perhaps medications to reduce your blood pressure and cholesterol level.\nIf you are diagnosed with an AAA that is 5.5cm or larger, you will be referred to a vascular surgeon (a surgeon who specialises in diseases of the blood vessels), who may recommend an operation.\nThe surgeon will discuss treatment options with you, taking into account your general health and fitness, as well as the size of your aneurysm.\nIf it&#8217;s decided that surgery isn’t suitable for you, it’s still possible to reduce the risk of the aneurysm bursting, and you will have regular scans to check its size – in the same way people with small or medium aneurysms are treated.\nSee below for more information on treating small and medium aneurysms.\nThere are two surgical techniques used to treat a large aneurysm:\n- endovascular surgery\n- open surgery\nAlthough both techniques are equally effective at reducing the risk of the aneurysm bursting, each has its own advantages and disadvantages.\nThe surgeon will discuss with you which is most suitable.\nEndovascular surgery is a type of &#8220;keyhole&#8221; surgery where the surgeon makes small cuts in your groin.\nA small piece of tubing called a graft– made of metal mesh lined with fabric – is then guided up through the leg artery, into the swollen section of aorta, and sealed to the wall of the aorta at both ends.\nThis reinforces the aorta, reducing the risk of it bursting.\nThis is the safest of the two types of surgery available. Around 98-99% of patients make a full recovery, and recovery time from the operation is shorter than if you have open surgery.\nThere are also fewer major complications, such as wound infection or deep vein thrombosis (DVT).&nbsp;\nHowever, the way the graft is attached is not as secure as open surgery. You’ll need regular scans to make sure the graft hasn’t slipped, and in some patients, the seal at each end of the graft starts to leak and will need to be resealed. You will need to have surgery again if either of these occurs.\nIn open surgery, the surgeon cuts into your stomach (abdomen) to reach the abdominal aorta and replaces the enlarged section with a graft.\nThis type of graft is a tube made of a synthetic material.\nBecause the graft is stitched (sutured) into place by the surgeon, it’s more likely to stay in place, and will usually work well for the rest of your life.\nThe risk of complications linked to the graft after surgery is lower than in people who have endovascular surgery.\nOpen surgery isn’t usually recommended for people who are in poor health as it is a major operation. It is slightly more risky than endovascular surgery, with 93-97% of patients making a full recovery.\nThe main risk of open surgery is death or heart attack, and recovery time is longer than with endovascular surgery.\nThere is also a greater risk of complications, such as wound infection, chest infection and DVT.\nIf you are diagnosed with a small (3.0-4.4cm) or medium (4.5-5.4cm) aneurysm, you won’t be referred to see a vascular surgeon, as it’s unlikely you’d benefit from surgery.\nYou’ll be invited back for regular scans to check the size of the aneurysm, in case it gets bigger – every year if you have a small aneurysm and every three months if you have a medium aneurysm.\nYou will also be given advice on how to prevent the aneurysm from getting bigger, including:\n- stopping smoking\n- eating a balanced diet\n- ensuring you maintain a healthy weight\n- taking regular exercise\nIf you smoke, the most important change you can make is to quit. Aneurysms have been shown to grow faster in smokers than in non-smokers.\nRead more about&nbsp;stopping smoking and&nbsp;nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) that can make it easier to stop smoking.\nYour GP will be sent your test result and may decide to change your current medication or start you on a new one, especially if you have:\n- high blood pressure&nbsp;– which you will probably be treated for with a medication called an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor\n- high cholesterol&nbsp;– which you will probably be treated for with a medication called a statin\nEmergency treatment for a ruptured AAA is based on the same principle as preventative treatment. Grafts are used to repair the ruptured aneurysm.\nThe decision on whether to perform open or endovascular surgery is made on a case-by-case basis by the surgeon carrying out the operation.\nThe best way to prevent getting an aneurysm, or reduce the risk of an aneurysm growing bigger and possibly rupturing, is to avoid anything that could damage your blood vessels.\nThis includes:\n- smoking\n- eating a high-fat diet\n- not exercising regularly\n- being overweight or obese\nIf your GP finds out you have high blood pressure or a high cholesterol level, you may be prescribed medication for both. This will reduce the risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).\nSmoking is a major risk factor for aneurysms because it causes atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) and raises your blood pressure.\nTobacco smoke contains substances that can damage the walls of the arteries.\nIt is known that smokers are seven times more likely than non-smokers to develop an AAA.&nbsp;\nThe more you smoke, the greater your risk. People who regularly smoke more than 20 cigarettes a day may have more than 10 times the risk of non-smokers.\nIf you want to stop smoking, your GP will be able to refer you to an NHS Stop Smoking Service, which will give you dedicated help and advice about the best ways to quit.\nYou can also call or chat online with Quit Your Way Scotland.&nbsp;The specially trained helpline staff can offer you free expert advice and encouragement.\nRead more about&nbsp;stopping smoking and&nbsp;nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs), which can make it easier to quit.\nEating a high-fat diet increases your risk of atherosclerosis.\nIt’s especially important to limit the amount of foods you eat that are high in saturated fat, such as biscuits, cakes, butter, sausages and bacon.\nThis is because eating too much saturated fat can lead to high cholesterol, which can build up in the artery walls.\nRead more about high cholesterol. Find out more about&nbsp;healthy eating and how to reduce the amount of saturated fat you eat.\nBeing active and doing regular exercise lowers blood pressure by keeping your heart and blood vessels in good condition.\nRegular exercise can also help you lose weight, which will also help lower your blood pressure.\nAdults should do at least 150 minutes (two hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity every week.\nExamples of moderate intensity activity include cycling or fast walking.\nFor it to count, the activity should make you feel warm and slightly out of breath. Someone who is overweight may only have to walk up a slope to get this feeling.\nPhysical activity can include anything from sport to walking and gardening.\nBeing overweight forces your heart to work harder to pump blood around your body. This can raise your blood pressure, which in turn puts pressure on your arteries.\nUse a&nbsp;BMI healthy weight calculator to find out if you need to lose weight.\nIf you need to shed some weight, it&#8217;s worth remembering that losing just a few pounds will make a big difference to your blood pressure and overall health.\nGet tips on losing weight safely&nbsp;"

        "disease": "Acne",
        "description": "Acne is a common skin condition that affects most people at some point. It causes spots, oily skin and sometimes skin that&#8217;s hot or painful to touch.\nAcne most commonly develops on the:\n- face – this affects almost everyone with acne\n- back – this affects&nbsp;more than&nbsp;half of people with acne\n- chest – this affects&nbsp;about 15% of&nbsp;people with acne\nThere are 6&nbsp;main types of spot caused by acne:\n- blackheads –&nbsp;small black or yellowish bumps that develop on the skin;&nbsp;they&#8217;re not filled with dirt, but are black because the inner lining of the hair follicle produces pigmentation (colouring)\n- whiteheads – have a similar appearance to blackheads, but&nbsp;may be firmer and won&#8217;t empty when squeezed\n- papules –&nbsp;small red bumps that may feel tender or sore\n- pustules –&nbsp;similar to papules, but have a white tip in the centre, caused by a build-up of pus\n- nodules –&nbsp;large hard lumps that build up beneath the surface of the skin and can be&nbsp;painful\n- cysts –&nbsp;the most severe type of spot caused by acne; they&#8217;re large pus-filled lumps that look similar to boils&nbsp;and carry the greatest risk of causing permanent scarring\nThe self-help techniques below may be useful:\n- Don&#8217;t wash affected areas of skin more than twice a day. Frequent washing can irritate the skin and make symptoms worse\n- Wash the affected area with&nbsp;a mild soap or cleanser and lukewarm water. Very hot or cold water can make acne worse\n- Don&#8217;t try to &#8220;clean out&#8221; blackheads or squeeze spots.&nbsp;This can make them worse and cause permanent scarring\n- Avoid using too much make-up and cosmetics. Use water-based products that are described as non-comedogenic (this means the product is less likely to block the pores in your skin)\n- Completely remove make-up before going to bed\n- If dry skin is a problem, use a fragrance-free, water-based emollient\n- Regular exercise can&#8217;t improve your acne, but it can boost your mood and improve your self-esteem.&nbsp;Shower as soon as possible once you finish exercising, as sweat can irritate your acne\n- Wash your hair regularly&nbsp;and try to avoid letting&nbsp;your hair fall across your face\nAlthough acne can&#8217;t be cured, it can be controlled with treatment. Several creams, lotions and gels&nbsp;for treating spots are available at pharmacies. If you develop acne, it&#8217;s a good idea to speak to your pharmacist for advice.&nbsp;\nTreatments can take up to 3&nbsp;months to work, so don&#8217;t expect results overnight. Once they do start to work, the results are usually good.\nAcne isn&#8217;t usually serious and can be treated by a pharmacist. If your acne is severe or appears on your chest and back,&nbsp;it may need to be treated with&nbsp;antibiotics&nbsp;or stronger creams that are only&nbsp;available on prescription. Your pharmacist can advise on whether you need to see your GP for further treatment.\nIf you develop nodules or cysts, they need to be treated properly through your GP to avoid scarring.&nbsp;Try to resist the temptation to pick or squeeze the spots, as this can lead to permanent scarring.\nIf you have acne you can get advice and treatment directly from a pharmacy. Find your local pharmacy on Scotland&#8217;s Service Directory.\nAcne is most commonly&nbsp;linked to the changes in hormone levels during puberty, but can start at any age.\nCertain hormones cause&nbsp;the grease-producing glands next to hair follicles in the skin to produce larger amounts of oil (abnormal sebum).\nThis abnormal sebum changes the activity of a usually harmless skin bacterium called P. acnes, which becomes more aggressive and causes inflammation and pus.\nThe hormones also thicken the inner lining of the hair follicle, causing blockage of the pores (opening of the hair follicles). Cleaning the skin doesn&#8217;t help to remove this blockage.\nAcne is known to run in families. If both your mother and father had acne, it&#8217;s likely that you&#8217;ll also have acne.\nHormonal changes, such as those that occur during the menstrual cycle or pregnancy, can also lead to episodes of acne in women.\nThere&#8217;s no evidence that diet, poor hygiene or sexual activity play a role in acne.\nRead more about the&nbsp;causes of acne,&nbsp;including some common acne myths.\nAcne is very common in teenagers and younger adults. About 80% of people aged 11&nbsp;to 30&nbsp;are affected by acne.\nAcne is most common in girls from the ages of 14&nbsp;to 17, and in boys from the ages of 16&nbsp;to 19.\nMost people have acne on and off for several years before their symptoms start to improve as they get older. Acne often disappears when a person is in their mid-twenties.\nIn some cases, acne can continue into adult life. About&nbsp;5% of&nbsp;women and 1% of men have acne over the age of 25.\nYou can find support and information from organisations like:\n- Changing Faces – a charity for people who have a visible difference or facial disfigurement, who can be contacted on 0300 012 0275 for counselling and advice\nAcne is caused when tiny holes in the skin, known as hair follicles, become blocked.\nSebaceous glands are tiny glands found near the surface of your skin. The glands are attached to hair follicles, which are small holes in your skin that an individual hair grows out of.\nSebaceous glands lubricate the hair and the skin to stop it drying out. They do this by producing an oily substance called sebum.\nIn acne, the glands begin to produce too much sebum. The excess sebum mixes with dead skin cells and both substances form a plug in the follicle.\nIf the plugged follicle is close to the surface of the skin, it bulges outwards, creating a whitehead. Alternatively, the plugged follicle can be open to the skin, creating a blackhead.\nNormally harmless bacteria that live on the skin can then contaminate and infect the plugged follicles, causing papules, pustules, nodules or cysts.\nTeenage acne&nbsp;is thought to be triggered by increased levels of a hormone called testosterone, which occurs during puberty. The hormone plays an important role in stimulating the growth and development of the penis and testicles in boys, and maintaining muscle and bone strength in girls.\nThe sebaceous glands are particularly sensitive to hormones.&nbsp;It&#8217;s thought that increased levels of&nbsp;testosterone cause the glands to produce much more sebum than the skin needs.\nAcne&nbsp;can run in families. If your parents had acne, it&#8217;s likely that you&#8217;ll also develop it.\nOne study has found that if both your parents had acne, you&#8217;re more likely to get more severe acne at an early age. It also found that if one or both of your parents had adult acne, you&#8217;re more likely to get adult acne too.\nMore than&nbsp;80% of&nbsp;cases of adult acne&nbsp;occur in women. It&#8217;s thought that many cases of adult acne are&nbsp;caused by&nbsp;the changes in hormone levels that many women have at certain times.\nThese times&nbsp;include:\n- periods&nbsp;– some women have a flare-up of acne just before their period\n- pregnancy&nbsp;– many women have symptoms of acne at this time, usually during the first 3&nbsp;months of their pregnancy\n- polycystic ovary syndrome&nbsp;–&nbsp;a common condition that can cause acne, weight gain and the formation of small cysts inside the ovary\nOther possible triggers of an acne flare-up include:\n- some cosmetic products&nbsp;–&nbsp;however, this is less common as most products are now tested,&nbsp;so they don&#8217;t cause spots&nbsp;(non-comedogenic)\n- certain medications&nbsp;–&nbsp;such as steroid medications, lithium&nbsp;(used to treat&nbsp;depression and bipolar disorder) and&nbsp;some anti-epileptic drugs (used to treat&nbsp;epilepsy)\n- regularly wearing items that place pressure on an affected area of skin, such as&nbsp;a headband or backpack\n- smoking&nbsp;– which can contribute to acne in older people\nDespite being one of the most widespread skin conditions, acne is also one of the most poorly understood.&nbsp;There are&nbsp;many myths and misconceptions about it:\nSo far, research hasn&#8217;t found any foods that cause acne. Eating a healthy, balanced diet is recommended because it&#8217;s good for your heart and your health in general.\nMost of the biological reactions that trigger acne occur beneath the skin, not on the surface, so&nbsp;the cleanliness of your skin&nbsp;has&nbsp;no effect on your acne. Washing your face more than twice a day could just aggravate your skin.\nThis could actually make symptoms worse and may leave you with scarring.\nHaving sex or masturbating won&#8217;t make acne any better or worse.\nThere&#8217;s no conclusive evidence that prolonged exposure to sunlight or using sunbeds or sunlamps can improve acne. Many medications used to treat acne can make your skin more sensitive to light, so exposure could cause painful damage to your skin, and also increase your risk of skin cancer.\nYou can&#8217;t pass acne on to other people.\nYour pharmacist can diagnose acne by looking at your skin. This involves examining your face and possibly your chest and back for different types of spot, such as blackheads or sore, red nodules.\nHow many spots you have and how painful and inflamed they are will help determine how severe your acne is. This is&nbsp;important in planning your treatment.\n4&nbsp;grades can be used to measure the severity of acne:\n- grade 1 (mild) – acne is mostly confined to whiteheads and blackheads, with just a few papules and pustules\n- grade 2 (moderate) – there are multiple papules and pustules, which are mostly confined to the face\n- grade 3 (moderately severe) – there&#8217;s a large number of papules and pustules, as well as the occasional inflamed nodule, and the back and chest are also affected by acne\n- grade 4 (severe) – there&#8217;s a large number of large, painful pustules and nodules\nIf acne suddenly starts&nbsp;in adult women, it&nbsp;can be a sign of a hormonal imbalance, especially if it&#8217;s accompanied by other symptoms such as:\n- excessive body hair (hirsutism)\n- irregular or light periods\nThe most common cause of hormonal imbalances in women is&nbsp;polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS can be diagnosed using a combination of&nbsp;ultrasound scans and blood tests.\nTreatment for acne depends on how severe it is. It can take several months of treatment before acne symptoms improve.\nThe various treatments for acne are outlined below.\nIf you just have a few blackheads, whiteheads and spots, you should be able to treat them successfully with over-the-counter gels or creams (topical treatments) that contain benzoyl peroxide.\nSee your GP if your acne is more widespread,&nbsp;as you probably need prescription medication.&nbsp;For example, if:\n- you have a large number of papules and pustules\n- over-the-counter medication hasn&#8217;t worked\nPrescription medications that can be used to treat acne include:\n- topical retinoids\n- topical&nbsp;antibiotics\n- azelaic acid\n- antibiotic tablets\n- in women, the combined oral contraceptive pill\n- isotretinoin tablets\nIf you have severe acne,&nbsp;your GP can refer you to an expert in treating skin conditions (dermatologist). For example, if you have:\n- a large number of papules and pustules on your chest and back, as well as your face\n- painful nodules\nA combination of&nbsp;antibiotic tablets and topical treatments is usually the first treatment option for severe acne. If this doesn&#8217;t work, a medication called&nbsp;isotretinoin may be prescribed.\nHormonal therapies or the combined oral contraceptive pill can also be effective in women who have acne. However, the&nbsp;progestogen-only pill or&nbsp;contraceptive implant can sometimes make acne worse.\nMany of these treatments can take 2&nbsp;to 3&nbsp;months before they start to work. It&#8217;s important to be patient and persist with a recommended treatment, even if&nbsp;there&#8217;s no immediate effect.\nBenzoyl peroxide works as an antiseptic to reduce the number of bacteria on the surface of the skin. It also helps to reduce the number of whiteheads and blackheads, and has an anti-inflammatory effect.\nBenzoyl peroxide is usually available as a cream or gel. It&#8217;s used either once or twice a day. It should be applied 20 minutes after washing to all of the parts of your face affected by acne.\nIt should be used sparingly, as too much can irritate your skin. It also makes your face more sensitive to sunlight, so avoid too much sun and ultraviolet (UV) light, or wear sun cream.\nBenzoyl peroxide can have a bleaching effect, so avoid getting it on your hair or&nbsp;clothes.\nCommon side effects of benzoyl peroxide include:\n- dry and tense skin\n- a burning, itching or stinging sensation\n- some redness and peeling of the skin\nSide effects are usually mild and should pass once the treatment has finished.\nMost people need a 6 week course of treatment to clear most or all of their acne. You may be advised to continue treatment less frequently to prevent acne returning.\nTopical retinoids work by&nbsp;removing dead skin cells from the surface of the skin (exfoliating)&nbsp;which helps&nbsp;to prevent them building up within hair follicles.\nTretinoin and adapalene are topical retinoids used to treat acne. They&#8217;re available in a gel or cream and are usually applied once a day before you go to bed.\nApply to all the parts of your face affected by acne 20 minutes after washing your face.\nIt&#8217;s important to apply topical retinoids sparingly and avoid excessive exposure to sunlight and UV.\nTopical retinoids aren&#8217;t suitable for use during pregnancy, as there&#8217;s a risk they might cause birth defects.\nThe most common side effects of topical retinoids are mild irritation and stinging of the skin.\nA 6 week course is usually required, but you may be advised to continue using the medication less frequently after this.\nTopical antibiotics help kill the bacteria on the skin that can infect plugged hair follicles. They&#8217;re available as a lotion or gel that is applied once or twice a day.\nA 6 to 8&nbsp;week course is usually recommended. After this, treatment is usually stopped, as there&#8217;s a risk that the bacteria on your face could become resistant to the antibiotics. This could make your acne worse and cause additional infections.\nSide effects are uncommon, but can include:\n- minor irritation of the skin\n- redness and burning of the skin\n- peeling of the skin\nAzelaic acid is often used as an alternative treatment for acne if the side effects of benzoyl peroxide or topical retinoids are particularly irritating or painful.\nAzelaic acid works by getting rid of dead skin and killing bacteria. It&#8217;s available&nbsp;as a&nbsp;cream or gel and is usually applied twice a day (or once a day if your skin is particularly sensitive).\nThe medication doesn&#8217;t make your skin sensitive to sunlight, so you don&#8217;t have to avoid exposure to the sun.\nYou&#8217;ll usually need to use azelaic acid for a month before your acne improves.\nThe side effects of azelaic acid are usually mild and include:\n- burning or stinging skin\n- itchiness\n- dry skin\n- redness of the skin\nAntibiotic tablets (oral antibiotics) are usually used in combination with a topical treatment to treat more severe acne.\nIn most cases, a class of antibiotics called tetracyclines is prescribed, unless you&#8217;re pregnant or breastfeeding.\nPregnant or breastfeeding women are usually advised to take an antibiotic called erythromycin, which is known to be safer to use.\nIt usually takes about 6&nbsp;weeks before you notice an improvement in your acne.\nDepending on how well you react to the treatment, a course of oral antibiotics can last 4&nbsp;to 6&nbsp;months.\nTetracyclines can make your skin sensitive to sunlight and UV light, and can also make the oral contraceptive pill less effective during the first few weeks of treatment.\nYou&#8217;ll need to use an alternative method of contraception, such as condoms, during this time.\nHormonal therapies can often benefit women with acne, especially if the acne flares up around&nbsp;periods or&nbsp;is associated with hormonal conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome.\nIf you don&#8217;t already use it, your GP may recommend the combined oral contraceptive pill, even if you&#8217;re not sexually active. This combined pill can often help improve acne in women, but may take up to a year before the full benefits are seen.\nCo-cyprindiol is a hormonal treatment that can be used for more severe acne&nbsp;that doesn&#8217;t respond to antibiotics. It helps to reduce the production of sebum.\nYou&#8217;ll probably have to use co-cyprindiol for 2&nbsp;to 6&nbsp;months before you notice a significant improvement in your acne.\nThere&#8217;s a small risk&nbsp;that women taking co-cyprindiol may develop breast cancer in later life.\nFor example, out of a group of 10,000 women who haven&#8217;t taken co-cyprindiol, you would expect 16 of them to develop breast cancer by the time they were 35. This figure rises to 17 or 18 for women who were treated with co-cyprindiol for at least 5&nbsp;years in their early twenties.\nThere&#8217;s also a very small chance of co-cyprindiol causing a blood clot. The risk&nbsp;is&nbsp;estimated to&nbsp;be around 1 in 2,500 in any given year.\nIt&#8217;s not thought to be safe to take co-cyprindiol if you&#8217;re pregnant or breastfeeding.&nbsp;Women may need to have a pregnancy test before treatment can begin.\nOther side effects of co-cyprindiol include:\n- bleeding and spotting between your periods, which&nbsp;can sometimes occur for the first few months\n- headaches\n- sore breasts\n- mood changes\n- loss of interest in sex\n- weight gain or weight loss\nIsotretinoin&nbsp;has a number of beneficial effects:\n- it helps to normalise sebum and reduce how much is&nbsp;produced\n- it helps to prevent follicles becoming clogged\n- it decreases the amount of bacteria on the skin\n- it reduces redness and swelling in and around spots\nHowever,&nbsp;the drug&nbsp;can also cause a wide range of side effects. It&#8217;s only recommended for severe cases of acne that haven&#8217;t responded to other treatments.\nBecause of the risk of side effects, isotretinoin can only be prescribed by a specially trained GP or a&nbsp;dermatologist.\nIsotretinoin is taken&nbsp;as a&nbsp;tablet. Most people take a 4&nbsp;to 6 month course. Your acne may get worse during the first 7 to 10 days of treatment. However, this is normal and soon settles.\nCommon side effects of isotretinoin include:\n- inflammation, dryness and cracking of the skin, lips and nostrils\n- changes in your blood sugar levels\n- inflammation of your eyelids (blepharitis)\n- inflammation and irritation of your eyes (conjunctivitis)\n- blood in your urine\nRarer side effects of isotretinoin include:\n- inflammation of the liver (hepatitis)\n- inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)\n- kidney disease\nBecause of the risk of these rarer side effects, you&#8217;ll need a&nbsp;blood test before and during treatment.\nIsotretinoin will damage an unborn baby. If you&#8217;re a woman of childbearing age:\n- don&#8217;t use isotretinoin if you&#8217;re&nbsp;pregnant or you think you&#8217;re pregnant\n- use 1, or ideally 2, methods of contraception for 1&nbsp;month before treatment begins, during treatment and for 1&nbsp;month after treatment has finished\n- have a pregnancy test before, during and after treatment\nYou&#8217;ll be asked to sign a form confirming that you understand the risk of birth defects and are willing to use contraceptives to prevent this risk, even if you&#8217;re not currently sexually active.\nIf you think you may&nbsp;have become pregnant when taking isotretinoin, contact your dermatologist immediately.\nIsotretinoin is also not suitable if you&#8217;re breastfeeding.\nThere have been reports of people experiencing mood changes while taking isotretinoin. There&#8217;s no evidence that these mood changes were the result of the medication.\nHowever, as a precaution, contact your doctor immediately if you feel depressed or anxious, have feelings of aggression or suicidal thoughts.\nSeveral treatments for acne don&#8217;t involve medication.\nThese include:\n- comedone extractor – a small pen-shaped instrument that can be used to clean out blackheads and whiteheads\n- chemical peels – where a chemical solution is applied to the face, causing the skin to peel off and new skin to replace it\n- photodynamic therapy – where light is applied to the skin in an attempt to improve symptoms of acne\nHowever, these treatments may not work and can&#8217;t be routinely recommended.\nAcne scarring can sometimes develop as a complication of acne. Any type of acne spot can lead to scarring, but it&#8217;s more common when the most serious types of spots (nodules and cysts) burst and damage nearby skin.\nScarring&nbsp;can also occur if you pick or squeeze your spots, so it&#8217;s important not to do this.\nThere are 3&nbsp;main types of acne scars:\n- ice pick scars – small, deep holes in the surface of your skin that look like the skin has been punctured with a sharp object\n- rolling scars – caused by bands of scar tissue that form under the skin, giving the surface of the skin a rolling and uneven appearance\n- boxcar scars – round or oval depressions, or craters, in the skin\nTreatments for acne scarring are regarded as a type of cosmetic surgery, which isn&#8217;t usually available on the NHS. However, in the past, exceptions have been made when it&#8217;s been shown that acne scarring has caused serious psychological distress.\nSee your GP if you&#8217;re considering having cosmetic surgery. They&#8217;ll be able to discuss your options with you and advise you about the likelihood of having the procedure carried out on the NHS.\nMany private clinics offer treatment for acne scarring. Prices can vary widely (from £500 to&nbsp;more than&nbsp;£10,000) depending on the type of treatment needed.\nThe British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons website has more information about private treatment available in your area.\nIt&#8217;s important to have realistic expectations about what cosmetic treatment can achieve. While treatment can certainly improve the appearance of your scars, it can&#8217;t get rid of them completely.\nAfter treatment for acne scarring, most people notice a 50-75% improvement in their appearance.\nSome of the available treatments for acne scarring are explained below.\nDermabrasion involves removing the top layer of skin, either using lasers or a specially made wire brush.\nAfter the procedure, your skin will look red and sore for several months, but as it heals you should notice an improvement in the appearance of your scars.\nLaser treatment can be used to treat mild to moderate acne scarring. There are 2&nbsp;types of laser treatment:\n- ablative laser treatment – where lasers are used to remove a small patch of skin around the scar to produce a new, smooth-looking area of skin\n- non-ablative laser treatment – where lasers are used to stimulate the growth of new collagen (a type of protein found in skin), which helps to repair some of the damage caused by scarring, and improves the appearance\nPunch techniques are used to treat ice pick scars and boxcar scars. There are 3&nbsp;types of punch technique:\n- punch excision –&nbsp;used to treat mild ice pick scars. The scar is surgically removed and the remaining wound is sealed. After the wound heals, it leaves a smoother and more even area of skin.\n- punch elevation –&nbsp;used to treat boxcar scars. The base of the scar is surgically removed, leaving the sides of the scar in place. The base is then reattached to the sides, but lifted up so it&#8217;s level with the surface of the skin. This makes the scar much less noticeable.\n- punch grafting –&nbsp;used to treat very deep ice pick scars. As with a punch excision, the scar is removed, but the wound is &#8220;plugged&#8221; with a sample of skin taken from elsewhere on the body (usually from the back of the ear).\nSubcision is a surgical treatment that can be used to treat rolling scars. During surgery, the upper layer of the skin is removed from the underlying scar tissue. This allows blood to pool under the affected area. The blood clot helps form connective tissue, which pushes up the rolling scar so it&#8217;s level with the rest of the surface of the skin.\nOnce subscision has been completed, additional treatment, such as laser treatment and dermabrasion, can be used to further improve the appearance of the scar.\nAcne can often cause intense feelings of anxiety and stress, which can sometimes make people with the condition become socially withdrawn. This combination of factors can lead to people with acne becoming depressed.\nYou may be depressed if during the last month you&#8217;ve often felt down, depressed or hopeless, and have little interest or pleasure in doing things.\nIf you think that you or your child may have depression, it&#8217;s important to speak to your GP.\nTreatments for depression include:\n- talking therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)\n- a type of antidepressant called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)\nRead more about treatment&nbsp;for depression."

        "disease": "Acute cholecystitis",
        "description": "Acute cholecystitis is swelling (inflammation) of the gallbladder. It is a potentially serious condition that usually needs to be treated in hospital.\nThe&nbsp;main symptom&nbsp;of acute cholecystitis is a sudden sharp pain in the upper right side of your tummy (abdomen) that spreads towards your right shoulder.\nThe affected part of the abdomen is usually extremely tender, and breathing deeply can make the pain worse.\nUnlike some others types of abdominal pain, the pain associated with acute cholecystitis is usually persistent, and doesn&#8217;t go away within a few hours.\nSome people may additional symptoms, such as:\n- a high temperature (fever)\n- nausea and vomiting\n- sweating\n- loss of appetite\n- yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice)\n- a bulge in the abdomen\nIf your GP practice is closed, phone 111.\nIt&#8217;s important for acute cholecystitis to be diagnosed as soon as possible, because there is a risk that serious complications could develop if the condition is not treated promptly.\nThe causes of acute cholecystitis can be grouped into 2&nbsp;main categories: calculous cholecystitis and acalculous cholecystitis.\nCalculous cholecystitis is the most common, and usually less serious, type of acute cholecystitis. It accounts for around 95% of all cases.\nCalculous cholecystitis develops when the main opening to the gallbladder, called the cystic duct, gets blocked by a gallstone or by a substance known as biliary sludge.\nBiliary sludge is a mixture of bile (a liquid produced by the liver that helps digest fats) and small crystals of cholesterol and salt.\nThe blockage in the cystic duct results in a build-up of bile in the gallbladder, increasing the&nbsp;pressure inside it and causing it to&nbsp;become inflamed. In around 1&nbsp;in every 5&nbsp;cases, the inflamed gallbladder also becomes infected by bacteria.\nAcalculous cholecystitis is a less common, but usually more serious, type of acute cholecystitis. It&nbsp;usually develops as a complication of a serious illness, infection or injury that damages the gallbladder.\nAcalculous cholecystitis is often associated with problems such as accidental damage to the gallbladder during major surgery, serious injuries or burns, blood poisoning (sepsis), severe malnutrition&nbsp;or AIDS.\nAcute cholecystitis is a relatively common complication of gallstones.\nIt&#8217;s estimated that around 10%&nbsp;to 15% of adults in the UK have gallstones. These&nbsp;don&#8217;t usually cause any symptoms, but in a small proportion of people they can cause&nbsp;infrequent episodes of pain (known as biliary colic) or acute cholecystitis.\nTo diagnose acute cholecystitis, your GP will examine your abdomen.\nThey will probably carry out a simple test called Murphy’s sign. You will&nbsp;be asked to breathe in deeply with your GP&#8217;s hand pressed on your tummy, just below your rib cage.\nYour gallbladder will move downwards as your breathe in and, if you have cholecystitis, you will experience sudden pain as your gallbladder reaches your doctor’s hand.\nIf your symptoms suggest you have acute cholecystitis, your GP&nbsp;will refer you to hospital immediately for further tests and treatment.\nTests you may have in hospital include:\n- blood tests&nbsp;to check for signs of inflammation in your body\n- an&nbsp;ultrasound scan of your abdomen to check for gallstones or other signs of a problem with your gallbladder\nOther scans – such as an X-ray, a&nbsp;computerised tomography (CT) scan or a&nbsp;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan – may also be carried out to examine your gallbladder in more detail if there is any uncertainty about your diagnosis.\nIf you are diagnosed with acute cholecystitis, you will probably need to be admitted to hospital for treatment.\nInitial treatment will usually involve:\n- fasting (not eating or drinking) to take the strain off your gallbladder\n- receiving fluids through a drip directly into a vein (intravenously) to prevent dehydration\n- taking medication to relieve your pain\nIf you have a suspected infection, you will also be given antibiotics. These&nbsp;often need to be continued for up to a week, during which time you may need to stay in hospital or you may be able to go home.\nWith this initial treatment, any gallstones that may have caused the&nbsp;condition&nbsp;usually fall back into the gallbladder and the inflammation&nbsp;often settles down.\nIn order to prevent acute cholecystitis recurring, and reduce your risk of developing potentially serious complications, the removal of your gallbladder will often be recommended at some point&nbsp;after the initial treatment.&nbsp;This type of surgery&nbsp;is known as a cholecystectomy.\nAlthough uncommon, an alternative procedure called a percutaneous cholecystostomy may be carried out if you are too unwell to have surgery. This is where a needle is inserted through your abdomen to drain away the fluid that has built up in the gallbladder.\nIf you are fit enough to have surgery, your doctors will&nbsp;need to decide when the best time to remove your gallbladder may be. In some cases, you may need to have surgery immediately or in the next day or 2, while in other cases you may be advised to&nbsp;wait for the inflammation to fully resolve over the next few weeks.\nSurgery can be carried out in two main ways:\n- laparoscopic cholecystectomy&nbsp;– a type of keyhole surgery where the gallbladder is removed using special surgical instruments inserted through a number of small cuts (incisions) in your abdomen\n- open cholecystectomy&nbsp;– where the gallbladder is removed through a single, larger incision in your abdomen\nAlthough some people who have had their gallbladder removed have reported symptoms of bloating and diarrhoea after eating certain foods, you&nbsp;can lead a perfectly normal life without a gallbladder.\nThe organ can be useful but it&#8217;s not essential, as your liver will still produce bile to digest food.\nWithout appropriate treatment, acute cholecystitis can sometimes lead to potentially life-threatening complications.\nThe main complications of acute cholecystitis are:\n- the death of the tissue of the gallbladder, called gangrenous cholecystitis, which can cause a serious infection that could spread throughout the body\n- the gallbladder splitting open, known as a perforated gallbladder, which can spread the infection within your abdomen (peritonitis) or lead to a build-up of pus (abscess)\nIn about 1&nbsp;in every 5&nbsp;cases of acute cholecystitis, emergency surgery to remove the gallbladder is needed to treat these complications.\nIt&#8217;s not always possible to prevent acute cholecystitis, but you can reduce your risk of developing the condition by cutting your risk of gallstones.\nOne of the main steps you can take to help lower your chances of developing gallstones is&nbsp;adopting a&nbsp;healthy, balanced diet and reducing the number of high-cholesterol foods you eat, as cholesterol is thought to contribute to the formation of gallstones.\nBeing overweight, particularly being obese, also increases your risk of developing gallstones. You should therefore control your weight by eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly.\nHowever, low-calorie, rapid weight loss diets should be avoided, because there is evidence they can disrupt your bile chemistry and actually increase your risk of developing gallstones. A more gradual weight loss plan is best.&nbsp;\nRead more about preventing gallstones."

        "disease": "Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia",
        "description": "Leukaemia is cancer of the white blood cells. Acute leukaemia means the condition progresses rapidly and aggressively and requires immediate treatment.\nAcute leukaemia is classified according to the type of white blood cells affected by cancer. There are 2 main types:\n- lymphocytes, which are mostly used to fight viral infections\n- neutrophils, which perform several functions, such as fighting bacterial infections, defending the body against parasites and preventing the spread of tissue damage&nbsp;\nThese pages focus on acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, which is cancer of the lymphocytes. The following other types of leukaemia are covered elsewhere:\n- chronic lymphocytic leukaemia\n- chronic myeloid leukaemia\n- acute myeloid leukaemia\nSymptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia&nbsp;usually begin slowly before rapidly getting severe as the number of immature white blood cells in your blood increases. Symptoms&nbsp;include:\n- pale skin\n- tiredness\n- breathlessness\n- having repeated infections over a short space of time\n- unusual and frequent bleeding\nRead more about the symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia\nAll of the blood cells in the body are produced by bone marrow – a spongy material found inside bones.\nBone marrow produces specialised cells called stem cells which have the ability to develop into three important types of blood cells:\n- red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body\n- white blood cells, which help fight infection\n- platelets, which help stop bleeding\nThe bone marrow usually produces stem cells which are allowed to fully develop before being released into the blood. But in acute leukaemia, bone marrow starts releasing large numbers of immature white blood cells known as blast cells.\nAs the number of blast cells increases there is a drop in the number of red blood cells and platelet cells. This drop causes the symptoms of anaemia, such as tiredness, and increases the risk of excessive bleeding.\nAlso, blast cells are less effective than mature white blood cells at fighting bacteria and viruses, making you more vulnerable to infection.\nDespite being uncommon overall, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is the most common type of cancer to affect children.\nThe cause or causes of acute leukaemia are uncertain, but known risk factors include:\n- exposure to high levels of radiation\n- exposure to benzene, a chemical used in manufacturing that is also found in cigarettes\nRead more information about the causes of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia\nSymptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia usually begin slowly before rapidly getting severe as the number of blast cells (immature white blood cells) in your blood increases.\nMost of the symptoms are caused by the lack of healthy blood cells in your blood supply.\nSymptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia include:\n- pale skin\n- feeling tired and breathless\n- having repeated infections over a short space of time\n- unusual and frequent bleeding, such as bleeding gums or nose bleeds\n- high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above\n- night sweats\n- bone and joint pain\n- easily bruised skin\n- swollen lymph nodes (glands)\n- abdominal pain – caused by a swollen liver or spleen\n- unexplained weight loss&nbsp;\n- a purple skin rash (purpura)\nIn some cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, the affected cells can spread from your bloodstream into your central nervous system. This can cause a series of neurological symptoms (related to the brain and nervous system), including:\n- headaches\n- seizures (fits)\n- vomiting\n- blurred vision\n- dizziness\nIf you or your child has some or even all of these symptoms, it is still highly unlikely that acute leukaemia is the cause.\nHowever, see your GP as soon as possible because any condition that causes these symptoms needs to be promptly investigated and treated.\nAcute lymphoblastic leukaemia is caused by a DNA mutation in the stem cells causing too many white blood cells to be produced.\nThe white blood cells&nbsp;are also released from the bone marrow before they are mature&nbsp;and able to fight infection like fully developed white blood cells.\nAs the number of immature cells increases,&nbsp;the number of&nbsp;healthy red blood cells and platelets fall, and it&#8217;s this&nbsp;fall&nbsp;which causes many of the&nbsp;symptoms of leukaemia.\nIt is not known exactly what causes this DNA mutation to occur, but there are&nbsp;a few&nbsp;factors which may increase the&nbsp;risk of&nbsp;developing acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.\nA small number&nbsp;of childhood acute lymphoblastic&nbsp;leukaemia cases are thought to be caused by related genetic disorders. For example, rates of leukaemia tend to be higher in children with Down’s syndrome.\nExposure to very high levels of radiation, either before birth or afterwards, is a known risk factor. However, it would require a significant level of radiation, such as the amount released during the nuclear reactor accident at Chernobyl.\nDue to the potential risk of radiation to unborn babies, medical techniques and equipment that use radiation, such as X-rays, are rarely used on pregnant women.\nMost cases of childhood leukaemia occur in children with no history of genetic disorders or exposure to radiation.\nExperts have also carried out extensive research to determine whether the following environmental factors could be a trigger for leukaemia:\n- living near a nuclear power station\n- living near a power line\n- living near a building or facility that releases electromagnetic radiation, such as a mobile phone mast\nAt the moment there is no evidence to confirm that any of these environmental factors increase the risk of developing leukaemia.\nExposure to the chemical benzene is a known risk factor for adult acute leukaemia. Benzene is found in petrol and is also used in the rubber industry. However, there are strict controls to protect people from prolonged exposure.\nBenzene is also found in cigarettes, which could explain why smokers are three times more likely to develop acute leukaemia than non-smokers. People who have had chemotherapy and radiotherapy to treat earlier, unrelated cancers also have an increased risk of developing acute leukaemia.\nThere is some evidence to show an increased risk of&nbsp;acute lymphoblastic&nbsp;leukaemia in people who:\n- are obese\n- have a weakened immune system – due to HIV or AIDS or taking immunosuppressants after an organ transplant\nThe first step in diagnosing acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is for your GP to check for physical signs of the condition, such as swollen glands, and to take a blood sample.\nA high number of abnormal white blood cells in the blood sample could indicate the presence of acute leukaemia and you will then be referred to a haematologist (a specialist in treating blood conditions).\nTo confirm a diagnosis of acute leukaemia, the haematologist will take a small sample of your bone marrow to examine under a microscope.\nThe haematologist will use a local anaesthetic to numb the skin over a bone – usually the hip bone – and then use a needle to remove a sample of bone marrow. You may experience some pain once the anaesthetic wears off and some bruising and discomfort for a few days afterwards. The procedure takes around 15 minutes to complete and you shouldn&#8217;t have to stay in hospital overnight.\nThe bone marrow will be checked for cancerous cells and – if found – the type of acute leukaemia will be determined at the same time.\nThere are various additional tests that can be used to help reveal more information about the progress and extent of the leukaemia. They can also provide an insight into how the leukaemia should be treated. These tests are described below.\nCytogenetic testing involves identifying the genetic make-up of the cancerous cells. There are specific genetic variations that can occur during leukaemia, and knowing what these variations are can have an important impact on treatment.\nImmunophenotyping is a test to help identify the exact type of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. A sample of blood, bone marrow or another type of fluid is studied.\nThis testing is important as the treatment needed may be slightly different for each type.\nA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test can be done on a blood sample. This is an important test to diagnose and monitor the response to treatment.\nThe blood test is repeated every three months for at least two years after starting treatment, then less often once remission is achieved.\nIf you have been diagnosed with acute leukaemia, further biopsies may be carried out on any enlarged lymph nodes that you have. These will be able to establish how far the leukaemia has spread.\nIf you have acute leukaemia, a computerised tomography scan (CT scan) may be used to check that your organs, such as your heart and lungs, are healthy.\nAn&nbsp;X-ray&nbsp;may be performed to examine the chest for any swollen lymph nodes.\nIf it is felt that there is a risk that acute leukaemia has spread to your nervous system, a lumbar puncture may be carried out.\nA lumbar puncture is a test where a needle is used under local anaesthetic to extract a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (fluid that surrounds and protects your spine) from your back. The fluid is tested to determine whether the leukaemia has reached your nervous system.\nTreatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia usually begins a few days after diagnosis as it&#8217;s an aggressive condition that develops rapidly.\nTreatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is carried out in stages:\n- induction – the aim of the initial stage of treatment is to kill the leukaemia cells in your bone marrow, restore the balance of cells in your blood&nbsp;and resolve any symptoms you may have\n- consolidation – this stage aims to kill any remaining leukaemia cells in your central nervous system\n- maintenance – the final stage involves taking regular doses of chemotherapy tablets to prevent the leukaemia returning\nMaintenance only seems to be effective in treating acute lymphoblastic leukaemia; it&#8217;s not usually used in the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia.\nThe induction stage of treatment is carried out in hospital or in a specialist centre. This is because you will probably need to have regular&nbsp;blood transfusions as it&#8217;s likely that your blood will not contain enough healthy blood cells.\nYou will also be vulnerable to infection, so it is important that you are in a sterile environment where your health can be carefully monitored and any infection that you have can be promptly treated. You may also be prescribed&nbsp;antibiotics to help prevent further infection.\nYou will be given&nbsp;chemotherapy to kill the leukaemia cells in your bone marrow. Although some medications may be given as pills, you will need more than one medication given as an injection. To make things easier and avoid repeated injections, they can all be given via one flexible tube&nbsp;into a vein in your chest (called a central line).\nSome chemotherapy medication may also be directly administered into your cerebrospinal fluid to kill any leukaemia cells that may have spread to your nervous system. This&nbsp;is given using a needle that is placed into your spine, in a similar way to a&nbsp;lumbar puncture.\nSide effects that occur following chemotherapy are common. They can include:\n- nausea\n- vomiting\n- diarrhoea\n- loss of appetite\n- mouth ulcers\n- tiredness\n- skin rashes\n- infertility\n- hair loss\nThe side effects should resolve once treatment has finished. Your hair will usually take between three to six months to grow back.\nYou may also be given corticosteroid injections or tablets to help improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy.\nIf you have a type of leukaemia known as Philadelphia chromosome-positive&nbsp;acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, you will also be given a medicine called imatinib. Imatinib works by blocking the signals in the cancerous cells that cause them to grow and reproduce. This kills the cancerous cells.\nImatinib is taken orally (as a tablet). The side effects of imatinib are usually mild and should improve over time. They include:\n- nausea\n- vomiting\n- swelling in the face and lower legs\n- muscle cramps\n- rash\n- diarrhoea\nDepending on how well you respond to treatment, the induction phase can last from two weeks to several months. In some cases, you or your child may be able to leave hospital and receive treatment on an outpatient basis if your symptoms improve.\nLeukaemia can return if just one cancerous cell remains in your body. Therefore the aim of consolidation treatment is to ensure that any remaining leukaemia cells are killed.\nTreatment involves receiving regular injections of chemotherapy medication. This is usually done on an outpatient basis, which means you will not have to stay in hospital overnight. However, you may require some short stays in hospital if your symptoms suddenly get worse or if you develop an infection.\nThe consolidation phase of treatment lasts several months.\nThe maintenance phase is designed to act as further insurance against the possibility of the leukaemia returning. It involves taking regular doses of chemotherapy tablets while undergoing regular check-ups to monitor how effective your treatment is proving.\nThe maintenance phase can often last for two years.\nAs well as chemotherapy and imatinib, other treatments are used in some circumstances. These are described below.&nbsp;\nDasatinib is a new type of medication used to treat Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, when all other treatments have proved unsuccessful.\nDasatinib blocks a protein called tyrosine kinase that helps stimulate the growth of cancer cells.\nDasatinib cannot cure acute leukaemia but it can slow its growth, helping to relieve symptoms and prolong life.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has not yet made a decision about whether the NHS should provide treatment with dasatinib for people with acute lymphoblastic&nbsp;leukaemia. This means it will be at the discretion of your local&nbsp;clinical commissioning group&nbsp;as to whether you will be offered the drug.\nRadiotherapy&nbsp;involves using high doses of controlled radiation to kill cancerous cells. There are two main reasons why radiotherapy is usually used to treat acute leukaemia:\n- to sometimes treat advanced cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia that have spread to the nervous system or brain\n- to prepare the body for a bone marrow transplant (see below)\nSide effects of both types of radiotherapy include:\n- hair loss\n- nausea\n- fatigue\nThe side effects should pass once your course of radiotherapy has been completed. However, your skin may be very sensitive to the effects of light for several months after the treatment has finished. If this is the case, avoid sunbathing or exposure to sources of artificial light, such as sunbeds, for several months.\nMany younger children treated with radiotherapy will go on to have restricted physical growth during puberty.\nA small number of people develop cataracts several years after radiotherapy. Cataracts are cloudy patches in the lens (the transparent structure at the front of the eye) that can make your vision blurred or misty. Cataracts can usually be successfully treated using surgery.\nRead more about cataracts&nbsp;\nIf you or your child do not respond to chemotherapy, a possible alternative treatment option is bone marrow or stem cell transplantation.\nTransplantations are more successful if the donor has the same tissue type as you, so the ideal donor is usually a brother or sister.\nBefore transplantation can take place, the person receiving the transplant will need to have aggressive high-dose chemotherapy and radiotherapy to destroy any cancerous cells in their body.\nThis can put a big&nbsp;strain on the body&nbsp;so transplantations are usually only successful when they are carried out in children and young people, or older people who are in good health, and when there is a suitable donor, such as a brother or sister.\nRead&nbsp;about bone marrow transplantation for more information\nBeing immunocompromised (having a weakened immune system) is a possible complication for some patients with acute leukaemia.\nThere are 2 reasons for this:\n- the lack of healthy white blood cells means that your immune system is less able to fight infection\n- many of the medicines used to treat&nbsp;acute leukaemia&nbsp;can weaken the immune system\nThis means that&nbsp;you are more vulnerable to developing an infection, and that any infection you have has an increased potential to cause serious complications.\nYou may be advised to take regular doses of antibiotics to prevent infections occurring. You should immediately report any possible symptoms of an infection to your GP or&nbsp;care team&nbsp;because prompt treatment may be required to prevent serious complications.\nSymptoms of infection include:\n- high temperature (fever) of 38C (101.4F) or above\n- headache\n- aching muscles\n- diarrhoea\n- tiredness\nAvoid contact with anyone who is known to have an infection, even if it is a type of infection that you were previously immune to, such as chickenpox or measles. This is because your previous immunity to these conditions will probably be lower.\nWhile it is important to go outside on a regular basis, both for exercise and for your psychological wellbeing, avoid visiting crowded places and using public transport during rush hour.\nAlso ensure that all of your&nbsp;vaccinations are up-to-date. Your GP or care team will be able to advise you about this. You will be unable to have any vaccine containing activated particles of viruses of bacteria such as:\n- the&nbsp;mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) vaccine\n- the polio vaccine\n- the oral typhoid vaccine\n- the BCG vaccine (used to vaccinate against tuberculosis)\n- the yellow fever vaccine\nIf you have acute leukaemia, you will bleed and bruise more easily due to the low levels of platelets (clot-forming cells) in your blood. Bleeding may also be excessive when it does occur.\nBleeding can occur:\n- inside the skull (intracranial haemorrhage)\n- inside the lungs (pulmonary haemorrhage)\n- inside the stomach (gastrointestinal haemorrhage)\nThe symptoms of an intracranial haemorrhage include:\n- severe headache\n- stiff neck\n- vomiting\n- change in mental state, such as confusion\nThe most common symptoms of a pulmonary haemorrhage are:\n- coughing up blood from your nose and mouth\n- breathing difficulties\n- a bluish skin tone (cyanosis)\nThe 2 most common symptoms of a gastrointestinal haemorrhage are:\n- vomiting blood\n- passing stools (faeces) that are very dark or tar-like\nAll 3 types of haemorrhages should be regarded as medical emergencies. Phone 999 to request an ambulance if you suspect that you or your child is experiencing a haemorrhage.\nMany of the treatments that are used to treat acute leukaemia can cause infertility. Infertility is often temporary, although in some cases it may be permanent.\nPeople who are particularly at risk of becoming infertile are those who have received high doses of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in preparation for bone marrow or stem cell transplantation.\nIt may be possible to guard against any risk of infertility before you begin your treatment. For example, men can have samples of their sperm stored. Similarly, women can have fertilised embryos stored, which can then be placed back into their womb following treatment.\nRead more about&nbsp;infertility\nReceiving a diagnosis of leukaemia can be very distressing, particularly if it is unlikely that your condition can be cured. At first, the news may be difficult to take in.\nThe situation can be made worse if you are confronted with the knowledge that even though your leukaemia may not currently be causing any symptoms, it could be a serious problem in later life. Having to wait many years to see how the leukaemia develops can be immensely stressful and can trigger feelings of stress, anxiety and depression.\nIf you have been diagnosed with leukaemia, talking to a counsellor or psychiatrist (a doctor who specialises in treating mental health conditions) may help you to combat feelings of depression and anxiety. Antidepressants or medicines that help to reduce feelings of anxiety may also help you cope better with the condition.\nYou may find it useful to talk to other people who are living with leukaemia. Your GP or multidisciplinary team may be able to provide you with details of local support groups.\nAnother excellent resource is Macmillan Cancer Support. Their helpline number is&nbsp;0808 808 00 00&nbsp;and is open Monday to Friday, 9am to 8pm.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nYou can read more information on all aspects of living and coping with cancer at the following links:\n- living with cancer – including information on treatment, support and personal experiences of cancer\n- living with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia&nbsp;– Cancer Research UK"

        "disease": "Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: Children",
        "description": "Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is a type of blood cancer. One third of all childhood cancers are leukaemia. Approximately, 3 out of 4 of these are acute lymphoblastic (ALL). ALL can affect children of any age but is more common in children aged 1 to 4 years old.\nMore children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.\nIt’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer. At times it can feel overwhelming but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.\nUnderstanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. Your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information, and if you have any questions it’s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.\nLeukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. All blood cells are made in the bone marrow, the spongy substance at the core of some bones in the body.\nBone marrow contains:\n- red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body\n- platelets, which help the blood to clot and control bleeding\n- white blood cells, which help fight infection\nThere are 2 different types of white blood cells: lymphocytes and myeloid cells (including neutrophils). These white blood cells work together to fight infection. Normally, white blood cells develop, repair and reproduce themselves in an orderly and controlled way. In leukaemia, however, the process gets out of control and the cells continue to divide in the bone marrow, but do not mature.\nThese immature dividing cells fill up the bone marrow and stop it from making healthy blood cells. As the leukaemia cells are not mature, they cannot work properly. This leads to an increased risk of infection.\nThere are 4 main types of leukaemia:\n- acute lymphoblastic (ALL)\n- acute myeloid (AML)&nbsp;\n- chronic lymphocyte (CLL)\n- chronic myeloid (CML)\nChronic leukaemias usually affect adults and each type of leukaemia has its own characteristics and treatment. ALL is a cancer of immature lymphocytes, called lymphoblasts or blast cells.\nThere are two different types of lymphocytes; T-cells and B-cells. Often, leukaemia occurs at a very early stage in the immature lymphocytes, before they have developed into either T-cells or B-cells. However, if the cells have developed this far before becoming leukaemic, the type of leukaemia may be known as T-cell or B-cell leukaemia.\nThis page is about acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL).\nThe exact cause of ALL is unknown. Research is going on all the time into possible causes of this disease. Children with certain genetic disorders, such as&nbsp;Down’s syndrome, are known to have a higher risk of developing leukaemia. Brothers and sisters of a child with ALL (particularly identical twins) have a slightly increased risk of developing ALL themselves, although&nbsp;this risk is still small.\nLike all cancers, ALL is not infectious and cannot be passed on to other people.\nAs the leukaemia cells multiply in the bone marrow, the production of normal blood cells is reduced. Children may therefore become tired and lethargic because of anaemia, which is caused by a lack of red blood cells.\nChildren may develop bruises, and bleeding may take longer to stop because of the low number of platelets present in their blood (which help blood to clot). Sometimes, children suffer from infections because of low numbers of normal white blood cells.\nA child is likely to feel generally unwell and may complain of aches and pains in the limbs or may have swollen lymph glands.\nAt first, the symptoms are just like those of a viral infection, but when they continue for more than a week or two, the diagnosis usually becomes clear.\nA blood test usually shows low numbers of normal white blood cells and the presence of the abnormal leukaemia cells. A sample of bone marrow is usually needed to confirm the diagnosis. A sample is also sent to the genetics department to look for any abnormal chromosomes, and for a test called MRD (minimal residual disease) analysis.\nA test called a lumbar puncture is done to see if the spinal fluid contains any leukaemia cells. A chest X-ray is also done, which will show if there are any enlarged glands in the chest. Other tests may be necessary, depending on your child’s symptoms.\nThese tests will help to identify the precise type of leukaemia and help doctors decide on the best treatment.\nThe aim of treatment for ALL is to destroy the leukaemia cells and enable the bone marrow to work normally again. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for ALL and is given according to a treatment plan (often called a protocol or regimen).\nThe treatment is given in several phases, or ‘blocks’.\nThis phase involves intensive treatment, aimed at destroying as many leukaemia cells as possible and is usually started within days of being diagnosed. The induction phase lasts 4 to 6 weeks. A bone marrow test is taken at the end of induction treatment to confirm whether or not the child still has leukaemia. The sample that is taken is looked at under a microscope and when there is no evidence of leukaemia, the child’s condition is referred to as being in ‘remission’.\nThe next phase of treatment is aimed at maintaining the remission and preventing the spread of leukaemia cells into the brain and spinal cord (the central nervous system, or CNS). CNS treatment involves injecting a drug, usually methotrexate lumbar puncture.\nAfter this consolidation treatment there is a recovery period which is called interim maintenance. This is when more drugs will be given to try to keep the leukaemia in remission. The exact details will depend on which arm of treatment your child follows and will be discussed in detail by your child’s doctor as it depends on your child’s response to treatment so far.\nFurther doses of chemotherapy treatment, called ‘delayed intensification’, are given to kill off any remaining leukaemia cells.\nThis phase of treatment lasts for 2 years from the start of interim maintenance for girls and 3 years from the start of interim maintenance for boys. It involves the child taking daily and weekly tablets, some children also have monthly injections of chemotherapy and oral pulses of steroids and 3-monthly intrathecal treatment.\nChildren will be able to take part in their normal daily activities as soon as they feel able to. Most children return to school before beginning maintenance treatment.\nBone marrow treatment is only needed by a minority of patients and is used for children with ALL that is likely to come back following standard chemotherapy.\nIn some situations, it may be necessary for boys to have radiotherapy to their testicles. This is because leukaemia cells can survive in the testicles despite chemotherapy.\nChildren who have leukaemia cells in their CNS when they are first diagnosed with ALL need more frequent lumbar punctures with intrathecal chemotherapy. Your child’s specialist will discuss with you which treatment and how much of it your child needs, and will answer any questions you have.\nMany cancer treatments will cause&nbsp;side effects. This is because while the treatments are killing the cancer cells, they can also damage some normal cells.\nSome of the main side effects of chemotherapy are:\n- hair loss\n- reduction in the number of blood cells produced by the bone marrow, which can cause anaemia (increased risk of bruising, bleeding and infection\n- loss of appetite\n- feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting)\nSteroid medicines can also cause side effects such as:\n- increased appetite\n- mood changes and irritability\n- weight gain\n- muscle weakness (especially in the legs)\nMost side effects are temporary, and there are ways of reducing them and supporting your child through them. Your child’s doctor or nurse will talk to you about any possible side effects. It’s important to discuss any side effects your child is having with the team treating them, so that they know how your child is feeling.\nA small number of children may develop late side effects, sometimes many years later. These include possible problems with puberty and fertility, a change in the way their heart works and a small increase in the risk of developing another cancer later in life. Your child’s doctor or nurse will talk to you about any possible late side effects.\nMany children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. Specialist doctors carry out trials for ALL.\nIf appropriate, your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial and will answer any questions you have. Written information is provided to help explain things.\nTaking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given enough time to decide if it is right for your child.\nSometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the condition is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the UK. The&nbsp;Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group&nbsp;(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.\nMost children with ALL are cured. If the leukaemia recurs after initial treatment, it usually does so within the first three years. Further treatment can then be given.\nLong-term side effects (late side effects) are rare, and most children with ALL grow and develop normally.\nIf you have specific concerns about your child’s condition and treatment, it’s best to discuss them with your child’s doctor, who knows the situation in detail.\nAs a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time.\nYour child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer.\nFurther information and advice if your child has cancer"

        "description": "This section is for teenagers and young adults and is about a type of cancer called acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The other main type of leukaemia that can affect teenagers and young adults is acute myeloid leukaemia.\nIf you’re looking for information about ALL in people of all ages, please see our general&nbsp;ALL section.\nLeukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. In leukaemia, the process for making new white blood cells gets out of control.&nbsp;Immature white blood cells (called blasts) keep being made and build up in the bone marrow until there isn’t enough room for the bone marrow to make healthy white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets. The body needs these cells to:\n- help fight infection (white cells)&nbsp;\n- carry oxygen from the lungs around&nbsp;the body (red blood cells)&nbsp;\n- stop cuts bleeding by clotting blood (platelets)\nMany of the symptoms of ALL are caused by having fewer than normal healthy blood cells in the body. Symptoms can include:\n- looking paler than usual and feeling tired – because of too few red blood cells (anaemia)\n- bruises&nbsp;– you may bruise more easily and it could take longer for bleeding to stop, if you have less blood clotting cells (platelets) than normal\n- infections – because there are too few mature white blood cells to fight infection\n- aches and pains in your bones\n- swollen glands (lymph nodes) in your neck, under your arm or in your groin\n- feeling unwell and run down\n- fever and sweats – you may have a high temperature without any obvious cause, such as an infection\n- headaches and visual disturbance\nThere can be other reasons you may have these symptoms. But if you are worried that you may have ALL, you should speak to your GP. They&#8217;ll examine you and refer you to a hospital if they think you need to see a specialist doctor.\nIt&#8217;s not known exactly what causes ALL. Research is going on to try to find out.\nYoung people with some genetic conditions, such as Down&#8217;s syndrome or Li-Fraumeni syndrome, are at an increased risk of developing ALL. A genetic condition is something you are born with.\nIf you think you have some of the symptoms of ALL you should speak to your GP. They can talk to you about your symptoms and arrange any&nbsp;tests they think you might need.\nTo understand leukaemia, it can help to know a little about the blood and bone marrow.\nLeukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells.&nbsp;\nAll blood cells are made in the bone marrow, which is like a blood cell factory inside bones. A type of cell in the bone marrow, called a stem cell, can make any kind of blood cell your body needs.\nThere are 3 main types of blood cells:\n- white blood cells – which help fight infection\n- red blood cells – which carry oxygen from the lungs around the body\n- platelets – which clot blood to stop cuts bleeding\nThe bone marrow normally makes millions of blood cells every day. To begin with, these new blood cells, called blasts, are not fully developed (they’re immature).\nThe main job of blast cells is to make more blood cells like themselves. They can’t do any of the jobs that mature blood cells can do, like carrying oxygen or fighting infection. Blast cells normally stay inside the bone marrow until they’ve matured into fully-developed blood cells.\nOnce blood cells are mature, they’re ready to do their jobs. They leave the bone marrow and go into the bloodstream, where they can be carried to wherever they’re needed.\nIn leukaemia, the process for making new white blood cells gets out of control and immature white blood cells (blasts) keep being made.\nThey build up in the bone marrow until there isn’t enough room for the bone marrow to make healthy white cells, red cells and platelets.\nLeukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. Healthy white blood cells are made from two types of blood cells:\n- lymphoblasts that make lymphocytes\n- myeloid cells (myeloblasts) that make other types of white blood cells such as neutrophils\nLeukaemias are named after the type of white blood cell that has become abnormal and started growing out of control. The most common types in teenagers and young adults are AML and ALL:\n- acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is leukaemia that starts from abnormal myeloid cells\n- acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is leukaemia that starts from abnormal lymphoblasts\nThere are other types of leukaemia that are more common in older people.\nWe also have more information about:\n- symptoms and causes of ALL&nbsp;\n- having tests for ALL&nbsp;\n- being treated for ALL&nbsp;\nIf you&#8217;re looking for information about ALL in people of all ages, read our general&nbsp;ALL section.\nIt’s important to remember that the symptoms of ALL can be caused by lots of different things. But you should go to your GP if you’re worried. They can talk to you about your symptoms and arrange any tests they think you might need.\nYour GP will examine you and arrange for you to have blood tests. There can be different reasons for your symptoms, so you’ll need a blood test to help diagnose acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). If you have ALL, a blood test will usually find leukaemia cells and you&#8217;ll be referred to a specialist at the hospital.\nThis specialist is called a haematologist and is a doctor who treats people with blood problems.\nThe haematologist will examine you and ask you about your symptoms and any recent illnesses. They will also arrange for you to have some more tests. These may include:\n- blood tests&nbsp;– you’ll need more blood tests even if you’ve had some already&nbsp;to look at the changes in the leukaemia cells and help&nbsp;the doctors decide on the best treatment for you\n- bone marrow test&nbsp;–&nbsp;to count the numbers of leukaemia cells in the bone marrow&nbsp;and get samples for cytogenetic and immunophenotyping testing\n- lumbar puncture&nbsp;– a small sample of the fluid that surrounds your brain and spinal cord is taken to check for leukaemia cells\n- chest X-ray&nbsp;– this may also be done to see if there are any swollen lymph nodes (glands) in your chest\nIf you have ALL, you might need a few more tests to check how your body is working in general. These could be blood tests, or an ultrasound scan of the tummy (abdomen) to look at your liver, spleen and kidneys, and an echocardiogram (an ultrasound of the heart).\nThis may seem like a lot of tests, but they give the doctors important information that will help them give you the right treatment.\nWaiting for test results can be a scary time, but understanding a little about them – what will happen, how you&#8217;ll feel and when you&#8217;ll get the results – can help you cope. Thinking about how you feel and getting support from family, friends or your specialist nurse and doctor can also make it a bit easier.\nYou could also use the Macmillan Support Line to get information and advice.\nWe also have more information about:\n- symptoms of ALL&nbsp;\n- being treated for ALL&nbsp;\n- leukaemia, blood cells and bone marrow&nbsp;\nIf you&#8217;re looking for information about ALL in people of all ages, read&nbsp;our general&nbsp;ALL section.\nThe main treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is chemotherapy. This means having anti-cancer drugs to destroy the leukaemia cells. You’ll also have drugs called steroids, which help the chemotherapy to work.\nThe treatment for ALL is pretty intensive at times and can cause unpleasant side effects. But you&#8217;ll be in close contact with the hospital when you’re most likely to feel unwell and the staff will be able to help if things get tough. Don’t feel you have to be brave. Be honest about how you are feeling with your doctors and nurses. They can give you medicines that can help you feel better.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nALL is treated in&nbsp;3&nbsp;phases:\n- getting rid of the leukaemia&nbsp;– remission induction\n- keeping the leukaemia away&nbsp;– consolidation and delayed intensification therapy\n- keeping the leukaemia away long-term&nbsp;– continuing or maintenance therapy\nYou usually start chemotherapy pretty quickly after finding out that you have ALL.\nYou&#8217;ll be in hospital for your treatment to begin with.&nbsp;If you&#8217;re 18 or younger, you&#8217;ll be treated in a specialist Principal Treatment Centre (PTC) for teenagers and young adults (TYA).&nbsp;If you&#8217;re 19 or older, you&#8217;ll be offered the choice of having treatment at the PTC or another hospital closer to home called a TYA designated hospital.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\nYou’ll be given chemotherapy as tablets, by injection and into your bloodstream (intravenously). You’ll also be given chemotherapy into the fluid around the spinal cord to make sure the leukaemia cells can’t hide there. This is called central nervous system (CNS) therapy. It&#8217;s also known as intrathecal therapy.\nYou’ll have a ‘line’ put in to one of your main veins to make it easier for you to have intravenous treatment. Your nurses and doctors can also use the line to take blood samples for blood tests. There are different kinds of lines.\nHaving chemotherapy can be hard. But the staff looking after you will give you medicines to help you cope with any side effects so you can stay strong enough to have treatment. And you’ll be given medicines to stop you feeling sick and antibiotics to help prevent infections.\nThere will probably be times when you feel rough and other times when you’ll feel better. You might also feel upset, down or irritable. Talking to someone you trust can help you cope with these feelings.\nBeing in hospital or coming up to hospital for clinics and treatment can be frustrating, especially when you miss out on stuff happening at school, college, university or work, or on things your friends are doing. You could try talking to your friends and family about this and see what they can do to help you. It can also help to talk to any new friends you’ve made who are going through similar experiences to you.\nWe have more information about&nbsp;chemotherapy that has been written for people of all ages, not just teens and young adults.&nbsp;\nThe first phase of your treatment is about getting rid of the leukaemia. You’ll be given chemotherapy to kill as many leukaemia cells as possible. Remission means there is no sign of leukaemia cells in your blood or bone marrow.\nThis type of treatment involves:\n- chemotherapy to kill the leukaemia cells (including CNS therapy)\n- steroids to help the chemotherapy work\n- drugs (allopurinol or rasburicase) to help protect your kidneys from problems that can happen when lots of leukaemia cells are destroyed at once\n- another tablet (for example ranitidine or lansoprazole) to stop indigestion or ulcers\nYou need to stay in hospital during this phase of your treatment so the doctors can check how things are going.\nTreatment to get you into remission takes about&nbsp;5 weeks, sometimes a bit longer. Being in hospital that long can be really difficult at times. If you&#8217;re struggling to cope, try and talk to your friends, family, doctors and nurses. It’s important not to bottle up your feelings otherwise your might end up finding it hard to cope. Drugs you may be given include:\n- vincristine\n- asparaginase\n- daunorubicin\n- mercaptopurine\n- methotrexate\nDifferent chemotherapy can cause different side effects.\nChemotherapy given as tablets or into the blood can reach most places in your body. But it isn’t good at getting into the brain or spinal cord (called the central nervous system or CNS). So you’ll be given treatment into the fluid that goes around the CNS to target any leukaemia cells that might be hiding there. This is called CNS therapy.\nCNS therapy is given during remission induction treatment (to get rid of the leukaemia) and continues right until the end of maintenance therapy.\nChemotherapy is given into the fluid, called cerebrospinal fluid or CSF, around your spinal cord. Drug treatment given into the CSF is called intrathecal therapy.\nIt’s a bit like having a lumbar puncture but with chemotherapy added. A doctor puts a needle into the space between 2 small bones (vertebrae) near the bottom of your spine. Then they inject chemotherapy into the CSF. The CSF will carry the chemotherapy around your CNS so it can reach any leukaemia cells that might be there.\nThe chemotherapy drug used for CNS therapy is called methotrexate.\nMost people don’t have side effects after having intrathecal methotrexate. But occasionally it can cause headaches, dizziness, tiredness or blurry vision for a few hours. Rarely other side effects like seizures (fits), weakness of your arms or legs and changes in how awake you are can happen. But these almost always go away completely and you can still have the intrathecal injections in the future.\nThis treatment is called consolidation and delayed intensification therapy. When you’re in remission, it means the doctors can’t see any leukaemia cells in your blood or bone marrow samples when they check them under the microscope. But there may still be leukaemia cells hiding in your body, so you need further treatment to get rid of these cells.\nYou’ll be given different types of chemotherapy drugs. This is so the leukaemia cells don&#8217;t have a chance to get used to them (which is called drug resistance).\nThis phase of treatment takes about 5 to 6 months. Most of the treatment can be given as an outpatient but you might need to stay in hospital for some parts of it.\nDrugs you may be given include:\n- cyclophosphamide\n- cytarabine (ara-C)\n- mercaptopurine\n- methotrexate\n- vincristine\n- asparaginase\n- doxorubicin\nChemotherapy does cause side effects.\nThis treatment is given to prevent the leukaemia from returning (known as relapse). The chemotherapy is given in low doses. You have it as an outpatient so you can keep doing all your normal, everyday activities when you’re having maintenance therapy.\nMaintenance therapy is given in 12-week cycles.\nYou’ll have:\n- mercaptopurine tablets each day\n- methotrexate tablets once a week\n- steroid tablets for 5 days every&nbsp;4&nbsp;weeks\n- vincristine chemotherapy every 4 weeks\n- methotrexate chemotherapy into your cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) every 12 weeks\nAt the moment, boys have just over&nbsp;3 years of maintenance therapy and girls have just over&nbsp;2 years. This is because it takes a bit longer in boys to get rid of any remaining leukaemia cells.\nDuring this time, you&#8217;ll have regular check-ups&nbsp;– usually every week or two&nbsp;– to check if your drug doses need to be adjusted and to make sure you&#8217;re OK. Very often, things like blood tests can be done at your GP practice or at home by a district nurse. Ask your doctor or nurse about arranging this."

        "disease": "Acute myeloid leukaemia",
        "description": "Leukaemia is cancer of the white blood cells. Acute leukaemia means it progresses rapidly and aggressively, and usually requires immediate treatment.\nAcute leukaemia is classified according to the type of white blood cells affected. The 2 main types of white blood cells are:\n- lymphocytes – mostly used to fight viral infections\n- myeloid cells – which perform a number of different functions, such as fighting bacterial infections, defending&nbsp;the body against parasites and preventing the spread of tissue damage&nbsp;\nThis topic focuses on acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), which is an aggressive&nbsp;cancer of the myeloid cells. The following types of leukaemia are covered separately:\n- acute lymphoblastic leukaemia\n- chronic myeloid leukaemia\n- chronic lymphocytic leukaemia\nThe&nbsp;symptoms of AML usually develop over a few weeks and become increasingly more severe. Symptoms can include:\n- pale skin\n- tiredness\n- breathlessness\n- frequent infections\n- unusual and frequent bleeding, such as bleeding gums or nosebleeds\nIn more advanced cases, AML can make you extremely vulnerable to life-threatening infections or serious internal bleeding.\nRead more about the complications of AML\nYou should see your GP if you or your child have possible symptoms&nbsp;of AML. Although it&#8217;s highly unlikely that leukaemia is the cause,&nbsp;these symptoms should be investigated.\nIf your GP thinks you may have leukaemia, they&#8217;ll arrange blood tests to check your blood cell production. If the tests suggest there&#8217;s a problem, you&#8217;ll be urgently referred to a haematologist (a specialist in treating blood conditions) for further tests and any necessary treatment.\nRead more about diagnosing AML\nAML&nbsp;occurs when specialised cells called stem cells, which are found in the bone marrow (a spongy material inside the bones),&nbsp;produce too many immature white blood cells. These immature cells are known as blast cells.\nBlast cells don&#8217;t have the infection-fighting properties of healthy white blood cells, and producing too many can&nbsp;lead to a&nbsp;decrease in the number of red blood cells (which carry oxygen in the blood) and platelets (cells that help the blood to clot).\nIt&#8217;s not clear exactly why this happens and, in most cases, there&#8217;s no identifiable cause. However,&nbsp;a number of factors that can increase your risk of developing AML have been identified. These include:\n- previous&nbsp;chemotherapy or radiotherapy\n- exposure to very high levels of radiation&nbsp;(including previous&nbsp; radiotherapy&nbsp;treatment)\n- exposure to benzene – a chemical used in manufacturing that&#8217;s also found in cigarette smoke\n- having an underlying blood disorder or genetic disorder, such as Down&#8217;s syndrome\nRead more about the causes of AML\nAML&nbsp;is a rare type of cancer.&nbsp;The risk of developing AML increases with&nbsp;age. It&#8217;s&nbsp;most common in people over 65.\nAML is an aggressive type of cancer that can develop rapidly, so treatment usually needs to begin soon after a diagnosis is confirmed.\nChemotherapy&nbsp;is the main treatment for AML. It&#8217;s used to kill as many leukaemia cells in your body as possible and reduce the risk of the condition coming back (relapsing).\nIn some cases, intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be needed, in combination with a bone marrow or stem cell transplant, to achieve a cure.\nRead more about treating AML\nThe symptoms of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) usually develop over a few weeks, becoming more severe as the number of immature white blood cells (blast cells) in your blood increases.\nSymptoms of AML can&nbsp;include:\n- pale skin\n- tiredness\n- breathlessness\n- a high temperature (fever)\n- excessive sweating\n- weight loss\n- frequent infections\n- unusual and frequent bleeding, such as bleeding gums or nosebleeds\n- easily bruised skin\n- flat&nbsp;red or purple spots on the skin (petechiae)\n- bone and joint pain\n- a feeling of fullness or discomfort in your tummy (abdomen), caused by swelling of the liver or spleen\nIn&nbsp;rare cases of AML, the affected cells can spread into the central nervous system. This can cause symptoms such as headaches, fits (seizures), vomiting, blurred vision and dizziness.\nSee your GP if you or your child have these symptoms. Although it&#8217;s highly unlikely that AML is the cause, these symptoms need to be investigated and treated&nbsp;promptly.\nAcute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is caused by a DNA mutation in the stem cells in your bone marrow that produce red blood cells, platelets and infection-fighting white blood cells.\nThe mutation&nbsp;causes the stem cells&nbsp;to produce many more white blood cells that are needed.\nThe white blood cells produced are still immature, so they don&#8217;t have the infection-fighting properties of fully developed white blood cells. These immature cells are known as &#8216;blast cells&#8217;.\nAs the number of immature cells increases, the amount of healthy red blood cells and platelets decrease, and it&#8217;s this fall that causes many of the symptoms of leukaemia.\nIt&#8217;s not known what triggers the genetic mutation&nbsp;in AML, although a number of different factors that&nbsp;can increase your risk of developing the condition have been identified.\nThe main risk factors for AML are&nbsp;outlined below.\nBeing exposed to&nbsp;a significant level of radiation&nbsp;can increase your chances of developing AML, although this usually requires exposure&nbsp;at very high levels. For example, rates of AML are higher in people who survived&nbsp;the atomic bomb explosions in Japan in 1945.\nIn the UK, most people&nbsp;are unlikely to be exposed to levels of radiation high enough to cause AML.&nbsp;However, some people who have had radiotherapy as part of their treatment for previous cancer (see below) can be the exception.\nExposure to the chemical benzene is a known risk factor for AML in adults. Benzene is found in petrol, and it&#8217;s also used in the rubber industry, although there are strict controls to protect people from prolonged exposure.\nBenzene is also found in cigarette smoke, which could explain why people who smoke have an increased risk of developing AML.\nTreatment with radiotherapy and certain chemotherapy medications for&nbsp;an earlier, unrelated cancer can increase your risk of developing AML many years later.\nLeukaemia that develops as a result of previous cancer treatment is called &#8216;secondary leukaemia&#8217; or &#8216;treatment-related leukaemia&#8217;.\nPeople with certain blood disorders – such as myelodysplasia, myelofibrosis or&nbsp;polycythaemia vera (PCV) – have an increased risk of developing AML.\nPeople with certain genetic disorders, including Down’s syndrome and Fanconi’s anaemia, have an increased risk of developing leukaemia.\nA number of other environmental factors that could trigger AML have also been suggested, including childhood vaccinations and living near a nuclear power station or a high-voltage power line. However, there&#8217;s no clear&nbsp;evidence to suggest that these can increase your risk of developing AML.\nIn the initial stages of diagnosing acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), your GP will check for physical signs of the condition and arrange for you to have blood tests.\nA high number of abnormal white blood cells, or a very low blood count in the test sample, could indicate the presence of leukaemia. If this is the case, you&#8217;ll be urgently referred to a haematologist (a specialist in treating blood conditions).\nA haematologist may carry out further blood tests, in addition to some of the tests outlined on this page.\nTo confirm a diagnosis of AML, the haematologist will take a small sample of your bone marrow to examine under a microscope. This procedure is known as a bone marrow biopsy, which is usually carried out under a local anaesthetic.\nThe haematologist will numb an area of skin at the back of your hip bone, before using a thin needle to remove a sample of liquid bone marrow. In some cases, a larger needle may also be used to remove a small amount of bone and bone marrow together.\nYou won&#8217;t feel any pain during the procedure, but you may experience some bruising and discomfort for a few days afterwards. The procedure takes around 15 minutes to complete, and you shouldn&#8217;t have to stay in hospital overnight.\nThe bone marrow sample will be checked for cancerous cells. If cancerous cells are present, the biopsy can also be used to determine the type of leukaemia you have.\nAdditional tests can be used to reveal more information about the progress and extent of your AML. They can also provide insight into how the condition should be treated. These tests are described below.\nGenetic tests can be carried out on blood and bone marrow samples to identify the genetic makeup of the cancerous cells. There are many specific genetic variations that can occur in AML, and knowing the exact type of AML you have can help doctors make decisions about the most appropriate treatment.\nFor example, people who have a type of AML known as acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APML) are known to respond well to a medicine called All Trans-Retinoic Acid (ATRA).\nIf you have AML, a&nbsp;computerised tomography (CT) scan,&nbsp;X-ray or echocardiogram (an&nbsp;ultrasound scan of the heart) may be used to check that your organs, such as your heart and lungs, are healthy.\nThese tests are carried out because it&#8217;s important for doctors to assess your general health before they can decide on the most appropriate treatment for you.\nIn rare situations where it&#8217;s thought there&#8217;s a risk that AML has spread to your nervous system, a lumbar puncture&nbsp;may be carried out. In this procedure, a needle is used to extract a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (which surrounds and protects your spine) from your back, so it can be checked for cancerous cells.\nIf cancerous cells are found in your nervous system, you may need to have injections of chemotherapy medication directly into your cerebrospinal fluid as part of your treatment.\nAcute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is an aggressive condition that develops rapidly, so treatment will usually begin a few days after a diagnosis has been confirmed.\nAs AML is a complex condition, it&#8217;s usually treated by a multidisciplinary team (MDT) – a group of different specialists working together.\nTreatment for AML is often carried out in 2 stages:\n- induction – the aim of this initial stage of treatment is to kill as many leukaemia cells in your blood and bone marrow as possible, restore your blood to proper working order and treat any symptoms you may have\n- consolidation – this stage aims to prevent the cancer returning (relapsing), by killing any remaining leukaemia cells that may be present in your body\nThe induction stage of treatment isn&#8217;t always successful and sometimes needs to be repeated before consolidation can begin.\nIf you have a relapse after treatment, both re-induction and consolidation may need to be carried out. This may be the same as your first treatment, although it&#8217;s likely to involve different medications or a stem cell transplant.\nIf you&#8217;re thought to have a high risk of experiencing complications of AML treatment – for example, if you&#8217;re over 75 years of age or have another underlying health condition – less intensive chemotherapy treatment may be carried out. This is less likely to successfully kill all of the cancerous cells in your body, but it can help control your condition.&nbsp;\nThe initial treatment you have for AML will largely depend on whether you&#8217;re fit enough to have intensive&nbsp;chemotherapy, or whether treatment at a lower dosage is recommended.\nIf you can have intensive induction chemotherapy, you&#8217;ll usually be given a combination of chemotherapy medication at a high dose to kill the cancerous cells in your blood and bone marrow.\nThis stage of treatment will be carried out in hospital or in a specialist centre, as you&#8217;ll need very close medical and nursing supervision.\nYou&#8217;ll have regular&nbsp;blood transfusions&nbsp;because your blood won&#8217;t contain enough healthy blood cells.\nYou&#8217;ll also be vulnerable to infection, so it&#8217;s important that you&#8217;re in a clean and stable environment where your health can be carefully monitored and any infection you have can be promptly treated. You may also be prescribed&nbsp;antibiotics to help prevent further infection.\nDepending on how well you respond to treatment, the induction phase can last from four weeks to a couple of months. You may be able to leave hospital and receive treatment on an outpatient basis if your symptoms improve.\nFor intensive treatment, the chemotherapy medications will be injected into a thin tube that&#8217;s inserted either into a blood vessel near your heart (central line) or into your arm (a peripherally inserted central catheter, or PICC).\nIn very rare cases, chemotherapy medication may also be directly administered into your cerebrospinal fluid to kill any leukaemia cells that may have spread to your nervous system. This is done using a needle that&#8217;s placed into your spine, in a similar way to a&nbsp;lumbar puncture.\nSide effects of intensive chemotherapy for AML are common. They can include:&nbsp;\n- nausea\n- vomiting\n- diarrhoea\n- loss of appetite\n- sore mouth and mouth ulcers (mucositis)\n- tiredness\n- skin rashes\n- hair loss\n- infertility – which may be temporary or permanent (see complications of AML for more information)\nMost side effects should resolve once treatment has finished. Tell a member of your care team if side effects become particularly troublesome, as there are medicines that can help you cope better with certain side effects.\nRead more about the side effects of chemotherapy\nIf your doctors don’t think you&#8217;re fit enough to withstand the effects of intensive chemotherapy, they may recommend non-intensive treatment. This involves using an alternative type of chemotherapy to the standard intensive therapy, which&nbsp;is designed more to control leukaemia rather than cure it.\nThe main aim of this treatment is to control the level of cancerous cells in your body and limit any symptoms you have, while reducing your risk of experiencing significant side effects of treatment.\nThe medications used during non-intensive chemotherapy may be given through a drip into a vein, by mouth or by injection under the skin, and can often be given on an outpatient basis.\nIf you have the sub-type of AML known as acute promyelocytic leukaemia, you&#8217;ll usually be given capsules of a medicine called ATRA, in addition to chemotherapy.\nATRA works by changing the immature white blood cells (blast cells) into mature healthy cells, and can reduce symptoms very quickly.\nSide effects of ATRA can include headaches, nausea, bone pain, and dry mouth, skin and eyes.\nIf induction is successful, the next stage of treatment will be consolidation.\nThis often involves receiving regular injections of chemotherapy medication that are usually given on an outpatient basis, which means that you won&#8217;t have to stay in hospital overnight. However, you may need some short stays in hospital if your symptoms suddenly get worse or if you develop an infection.\nThe consolidation phase of treatment lasts several months.\nMany other treatments are used for AML.&nbsp;\nRadiotherapy&nbsp;involves using high doses of controlled radiation&nbsp;to kill cancerous cells. There are 2 main reasons why radiotherapy is usually used to treat AML:\n- to prepare the body for a bone marrow or stem cell transplant\n- to treat advanced cases that have spread to the nervous system and/or brain, although this is uncommon\nSide effects of radiotherapy&nbsp;can include hair loss, nausea and fatigue. The side effects should pass once your course of radiotherapy has been completed.\nIf chemotherapy doesn&#8217;t work, a possible alternative treatment option is a bone marrow or stem cell transplant.\nBefore transplantation can take place, the person receiving the transplant will need to have&nbsp;intensive high-dose chemotherapy and possibly radiotherapy to destroy the cells in their bone marrow. The donated stem cells are given through a tube into a blood vessel, in a similar way to chemotherapy medication.\nThis process can put an enormous amount of strain on the body and cause significant side effects and potential complications, so you&#8217;ll usually need to stay in hospital for a few weeks.\nTransplantations have better outcomes if the donor has the same tissue type as the person receiving the donation. The best candidate to provide a donation is usually a brother or sister with the same tissue type.\nTransplantations are most successful when they&#8217;re carried out on children and young people, or older people who are otherwise in good health, and when there&#8217;s a suitable donor, such as a brother or sister.\nRead about bone marrow donation\nAzacitidine is a possible alternative treatment for adults with AML who can&#8217;t have a stem cell transplant.\nIt&#8217;s recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for use&nbsp;in certain circumstances&nbsp;– for example, depending on the characteristics of the person&#8217;s blood and bone marrow.\nAzacitidine is a chemotherapy medication that&#8217;s given by injection under the skin. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells and destroys them, and also helps bone marrow to produce normal blood cells.\nNICE has more information about azacitidine for the treatment of AML\nIn the UK, a number of clinical trials&nbsp;are currently underway that aim to find the best way of treating AML. Clinical trials are studies that use new and experimental techniques to see how well they work in treating, and possibly curing, AML.\nAs part of your treatment, your care team may suggest taking part in a clinical trial to help researchers learn more about the best way to treat your AML, and AML in general.\nIf you take part in a clinical trial, you may be offered medication that isn&#8217;t licensed for use in the UK and isn&#8217;t normally available. However, there&#8217;s no guarantee that the techniques being studied in the clinical trial will work better than current treatments.\nYour care team can tell you whether there are any clinical trials available in your area, and can explain the benefits and risks involved.\nIf you have acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), you may experience a number of complications. These can be caused by the condition itself, although they can also occur as a side effect of treatment.\nHaving a weakened immune system – being immunocompromised – is a common complication of AML.\nEven if your blood is restored to normal working order with treatment, many of the medications that are used to treat&nbsp;AML can temporarily weaken your immune system.\nThis means you&#8217;re more vulnerable to developing an infection, and any infection you develop could be more serious than usual. Complications arising from infection are the leading cause of death in people with AML. However, if treated early, nearly all infections respond to appropriate treatment.\nTherefore, you may be advised to:\n- take regular doses of antibiotics to prevent bacterial infections\n- maintain good personal and dental hygiene\n- avoid contact with anyone who&#8217;s&nbsp;known to have an infection – even if it&#8217;s a type of infection that you were previously immune to, such as&nbsp;chickenpox or measles\n- check with your GP to ensure that all of your vaccinations are up to date, although&nbsp;you won&#8217;t be able to have any vaccine that contains &#8216;live&#8217; viruses or bacteria, such as the&nbsp;shingles vaccine and MMR vaccine (against measles, mumps and rubella)\nReport any possible symptoms of an infection&nbsp;to your&nbsp;treatment unit immediately because prompt treatment may be needed to prevent complications.\nSymptoms of an infection can&nbsp;include:\n- a high temperature (fever)\n- a&nbsp;headache\n- aching muscles\n- diarrhoea\n- tiredness\nIf you have AML, you&#8217;ll bleed and bruise more easily due to the low levels of platelets (clot-forming cells) in your blood. Bleeding may also be excessive.\nPeople with advanced AML are more&nbsp;vulnerable to excessive bleeding inside their body, which is the second most common cause of death in people with the condition.\nSerious bleeding can occur:\n- inside&nbsp;the skull (intracranial haemorrhage) – causing symptoms such as a&nbsp;severe headache, stiff neck, vomiting and confusion\n- inside the lungs (pulmonary haemorrhage) – causing&nbsp;symptoms such as coughing up blood,&nbsp;breathing difficulties and a&nbsp;bluish skin tone (cyanosis)\n- inside the stomach (gastrointestinal haemorrhage) – causing symptoms such as&nbsp;vomiting blood and&nbsp;passing stools (faeces) that are very dark or tar-like in colour\nAll these types of haemorrhage should be regarded as medical emergencies. Dial 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance if you think a haemorrhage is occurring.\nMany of the treatments that are used to treat AML can cause infertility.&nbsp;This is often temporary, but in some cases can be permanent.\nPeople who are particularly at risk of permanent infertility, are those who have received high doses of chemotherapy and&nbsp;radiotherapy in preparation for a bone marrow or stem cell transplant.\nYour treatment team can give a good estimation of the risk of infertility in your specific circumstances.\nIt may be possible to guard against any risk of infertility before you begin your treatment. For example, men can have their sperm samples stored. Similarly, women can have eggs or&nbsp;fertilised embryos stored, which can then be placed back into their womb, following treatment.\nHowever, as AML is an aggressive condition that develops rapidly, there may not always be time to do this before treatment needs to start."

        "disease": "Acute myeloid leukaemia: Children",
        "description": "Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a type of blood cancer. A third of all childhood cancers are leukaemia. Less than a quarter of these are acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). AML can affect children of any age. Girls and boys are equally affected\nMore children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.\nIt’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer. At times it can feel overwhelming but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.\nUnderstanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. Your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information and if you have any questions it’s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.\nLeukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. All blood cells are produced in the bone marrow, the spongy substance at the core of some of the bones in the body.\nBone marrow contains:\n- red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body\n- platelets, which help the blood to clot and control bleeding\n- white blood cells, which help to fight infection\nThere are 2 different types of white blood cells: lymphocytes and myeloid cells (including neutrophils). These white blood cells work together to fight infection. Normally, white blood cells develop, repair and reproduce themselves in an orderly and controlled way. In leukaemia, however, the process gets out of control and the cells continue to divide in the bone marrow, but do not mature.\nThese immature dividing cells fill up the bone marrow and stop it from making healthy blood cells. As the leukaemia cells are not mature, they cannot work properly. This leads to an increased risk of infection.\nThere are 4 main types of leukaemia:\n- acute lymphoblastic (ALL)\n- acute myeloid (AML)\n- chronic lymphocytic (CLL)\n- chronic myeloid (CML)\nChronic leukaemias occur mostly in adults. CLL is exclusively an adult condition, whereas CML does occur rarely in children and young people. Each type of leukaemia has its own characteristics and treatment.\nThis page is about acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).\nAcute myeloid leukaemia is an overproduction of immature myeloid white blood cells (blast cells).\nCells that have started to show some of the features of myeloid cells are said to show differentiation. Cells that do not show signs of becoming a particular type of white blood cell are known as undifferentiated.\nThere are different sub-types of AML, depending on exactly which type of cell has become leukaemic, the stage of development (maturation) the cells are at, and whether the cells are differentiated. Knowing the sub-type of AML is important, as it helps doctors decide on the best treatment.&nbsp;\nThere are several classification systems for the sub-types of AML. The most commonly used system in the UK is the French-American-British (FAB) system.\n- M0 – AML with minimal evidence of myeloid differentiation\n- M1 – AML without maturation\n- M2 – AML with maturation\n- M3 – Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL)\n- M4 – Acute myelomonocytic leukaemia\n- M5 – Acute monocytic/monoblastic leukaemia\n- M6&nbsp;– Acute erythroleukaemia\n- M7 – Acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia\nA newer system known as the WHO (World Health Organization) classification system is also sometimes used.\nThe exact cause of AML is unknown. Research into possible causes of this disease is ongoing. Children with certain genetic disorders, such as&nbsp;Down’s syndrome&nbsp;or Li-Fraumeni syndrome, are known to have a higher risk of developing leukaemia. Brothers and sisters of a child with AML have a slightly increased risk of developing it, although this risk is still small. Other non-cancerous conditions, such as aplastic anaemia or the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), may increase a child’s risk of developing AML.\nAML, like all types of cancer, is not infectious and cannot be passed on to other people.\nAs the leukaemia cells multiply in the bone marrow, the production of normal blood cells is reduced. Children may therefore become tired and lethargic because of anaemia, which is caused by a lack of red blood cells.\nChildren may develop bruises, and bleeding may take longer to stop because of the low number of platelets present in their blood. Sometimes they may suffer from infections because of low numbers of normal white blood cells.\nA child is likely to feel generally unwell and may complain of aches and pains in the limbs or may have swollen lymph glands.\nAt first, the symptoms are just like those of a viral infection, but when they continue for more than a week or two, the diagnosis usually becomes clear.\nA blood test usually shows low numbers of normal white blood cells and the presence of abnormal leukaemia cells. A sample of bone marrow is needed to confirm the diagnosis. The bone marrow sample is also examined to check for any abnormalities in the chromosomes of the leukaemia cells.\nA test called a lumbar puncture is done to see if the spinal fluid contains any leukaemia cells. A chest X-ray is also done, which will show if there are any enlarged glands in the chest. Other tests may be necessary, depending on your child’s symptoms.\nThese tests will help to identify the precise type of leukaemia, and help doctors to decide on the best treatment.\nThe aim of treatment for AML is to destroy the leukaemia cells and enable the bone marrow to work normally again. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for AML. Usually a combination of chemotherapy drugs is given, according to a treatment plan (often called a protocol or regimen).\nThe treatment usually has different phases.\nThis phase involves intensive treatment, aimed at destroying as many leukaemia cells as possible. It usually involves 2 courses (cycles) of a combination of chemotherapy drugs.\nA bone marrow test is taken at the end of induction treatment to confirm whether or not the child still has leukaemia. When there is no evidence of leukaemia, the child’s condition is referred to as being in remission.\nWhen there are no signs of the leukaemia in the blood or bone marrow, further treatment is often given. This phase of the treatment aims to destroy any leukaemia cells that may be left and to help stop the AML from coming back. This treatment usually involves 2 more courses of chemotherapy.\nThis treatment is usually only used for children with AML that is likely to come back or has come back (recurred) following standard chemotherapy.\nAML may sometimes develop in the brain and spinal cord. This can be prevented by injecting chemotherapy drugs directly into the spinal fluid during a lumbar puncture (intrathecal chemotherapy). Intrathecal chemotherapy is usually given after each of the first 2 courses of chemotherapy. Sometimes a more intensive treatment is needed, and the intrathecal drugs are given more frequently until all the regular chemotherapy has been completed. Occasionally, radiotherapy to the brain is also necessary.\nMany cancer treatments will cause&nbsp;side effects. This is because while the treatments are killing the cancer cells, they can also damage some normal cells.\nSome of the main side effects are:\n- hair loss\n- reduction in the number of blood cells produced by the bone marrow, which can cause anaemia (increased risk of bruising, bleeding and infection)\n- loss of appetite and weight\n- feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting)\nMost side effects are temporary, and there are ways of reducing them and supporting your child through them. Your child’s doctor or nurse will talk to you about side effects.\nA small number of children may develop late side effects, sometimes many years later. These include possible problems with puberty and fertility, a change in the way the heart works, and a small increase in the risk of developing a second cancer in later life. Your child’s doctor or nurse will talk to you about any possible late side effects.\nMany children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. Specialist doctors carry out trials for AML. If appropriate, your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial and will answer any questions you have. Written information is often provided to help explain things.\nTaking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide if it’s right for your child.\nSometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child’s cancer. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the cancer is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The&nbsp;Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group&nbsp;(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.\nMany children with AML are cured. If the leukaemia comes back after initial treatment, it usually does so within the first 3 years. Most children with AML grow and develop normally.\nIf you have specific concerns about your child’s condition and treatment, it’s best to discuss them with your child’s doctor, who knows the situation in detail.\nAs a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time.\nYour child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience of cancer.\nFurther information and advice if your child has cancer"

        "disease": "Acute myeloid leukaemia: Teenagers and young adults",
        "description": "This section is for teenagers and young adults and is about a type of cancer called acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The other main type of leukaemia that can affect teenagers and young adults is acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.\nFor information about AML in people of all ages,&nbsp;read our general&nbsp;AML section.\nLeukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. In leukaemia, the process for making new white blood cells gets out of control.\nImmature white blood cells (called blasts) keep being made and build up in the bone marrow until there isn’t enough room for the bone marrow to make healthy white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets. The body needs these cells to:\n- help fight infection (white cells)\n- carry oxygen from the lungs around the body (red blood cells)\n- stop&nbsp;cuts bleeding by clotting blood (platelets)\nMany of the symptoms of AML are caused by having fewer than normal healthy blood cells in the body. Symptoms can include:\n- looking paler than usual and feeling tired –&nbsp;because of too few red blood cells (anaemia)\n- bruises or bleeding&nbsp;– you may bruise more easily and it could take longer for bleeding to stop, if you have less blood clotting cells (platelets) than normal\n- infections&nbsp;– because there are too few mature white blood cells to fight infection\n- aches and pains in your bones\n- swollen glands (lymph nodes) in your neck, under your arm or in your groin\n- feeling unwell and run down\n- fever and sweats&nbsp;– you may have a high temperature without any obvious cause, such as an infection\n- headaches and blurred vision&nbsp;– because of too many white blood cells\n- breathlessness&nbsp;– because of too many white blood cells.\nIt&#8217;s not known&nbsp;exactly what causes AML. Research is going on to try to find out. We do know some things might increase the risk of AML:\n- some genetic conditions, like Down&#8217;s Syndrome&nbsp;(a&nbsp;genetic condition is something you are born with)\n- some non-cancerous conditions of the bone marrow, such as aplastic anaemia or myelodysplastic syndromes\nIf you think you might have any of the symptoms of AML, you should go to your GP. They&#8217;ll talk to you about your symptoms, examine you and can arrange&nbsp;tests or refer you to see a specialist.&nbsp;Remember that the symptoms can be caused by other things, but it’s important to go and get checked if you are worried.&nbsp;\nTo understand leukaemia, it can help to know a little about the blood and bone marrow.\nLeukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells.\nAll blood cells are made in the bone marrow, which is like a blood cell factory inside bones. A type of cell in the bone marrow, called a stem cell, can make any kind of blood cell your body needs.\nThere are&nbsp;3 main types of blood cells:\n- white blood cells –&nbsp;which help fight infection\n- red blood cells – which carry oxygen from the lungs around the body\n- platelets – which clot blood to stop cuts bleeding\nThe bone marrow normally makes millions of blood cells every day. To begin with, these new blood cells, called blasts, are not fully developed (they’re immature).\nThe main job of blast cells is to make more blood cells like themselves. They can’t do any of the jobs that mature blood cells can do, like carrying oxygen or fighting infection. Blast cells normally stay inside the bone marrow until they’ve matured into fully-developed blood cells.\nOnce blood cells are mature, they’re ready to do their jobs. They leave the bone marrow and go into the bloodstream, where they can be carried to wherever they’re needed.\nIn leukaemia, the process for making new white blood cells gets out of control and immature white blood cells (blasts) keep being made.\nThey build up in the bone marrow until there isn’t enough room for the bone marrow to make healthy white cells, red cells and platelets.\nLeukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. Healthy white blood cells are made from&nbsp;2 types of blood cells:\n- lymphoblasts that make lymphocytes\n- myeloid cells (myeloblasts) that make other types of white blood cells such as neutrophils\nLeukaemias are named after the type of white blood cell that has become abnormal and started growing out of control. The most common types in teenagers and young adults are AML and ALL:\n- acute myeloid leukaemia&nbsp;(AML) is leukaemia that starts from abnormal myeloid cells\n- acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is leukaemia that starts from abnormal lymphoblasts\nThere are other types of leukaemia that are more common in older people.\nThe information in this section is about ALL, but if you have a different type of leukaemia and want to know more, contact Macmillan Cancer Support.\nWe also have more information about:\n- symptoms and causes of AML&nbsp;\n- having tests for AML&nbsp;\n- being treated for AML&nbsp;\nIf you&#8217;re looking for information about ALL in people of all ages, read general&nbsp;AML section.\nYou should speak to your GP as soon as possible if you think you have some of the&nbsp;symptoms of AML. But remember that the symptoms of AML can be caused by other things.\nYour GP will examine you and arrange for you to have blood tests. There can be different reasons for your symptoms, so you’ll need to have a blood test to help diagnose acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). If you have AML, a blood test will usually find leukaemia cells and you&#8217;ll be referred to a specialist at the hospital.\nThis specialist is called a haematologist and is a doctor who treats people with blood disorders.\nThe haematologist will examine you and ask you about your symptoms and any recent illnesses. They will also arrange for you to have some more tests. These may include:\n- blood tests&nbsp;– you’ll need more blood tests even if you’ve had some already to&nbsp;look at the changes in the leukaemia cells and help the doctors decide on the best treatment for you; these tests may be called cytogenetics and immunophenotyping\n- bone marrow test&nbsp;– to count the numbers of leukaemia cells in the bone marrow&nbsp;and get send samples for cytogenetic and immunophenotyping testing\n- lumbar puncture&nbsp;– a small sample of the fluid that surrounds your brain and spinal cord is taken to check for leukaemia cells\n- chest X-ray&nbsp;– this may also be done to see if there are any swollen lymph nodes (glands) in your chest\nIf you have AML, you might need a few more tests to check how your body is working in general. These could be blood tests, an ultrasound scan of the tummy (abdomen) to look at your liver, spleen and kidneys, or an echocardiogram (which is an ultrasound of the heart).\nThis may seem like a lot of tests, but they give the doctors important information that will help them give you the right treatment.\nWaiting for test results can be a scary time, but understanding a little about them – what will happen, how you&#8217;ll feel and when you&#8217;ll get the results – can help you cope. Thinking about how you feel and getting support from family, friends or your specialist nurse and doctor can also make it a bit easier. You could also talk to a cancer support specialist on the Macmillan Support Line.\nWe also have more information about:\n- symptoms and causes of AML&nbsp;\n- being treated for AML\n- leukaemia, blood cells and bone marrow\nIf you&#8217;re looking for information about AML in people of all ages, read our general AML&nbsp;section.\nThe main treatment for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is chemotherapy. This means having anti-cancer drugs to destroy the leukaemia cells. You’ll also have drugs called steroids, which help the chemotherapy to work.\nThe treatment for AML is pretty intensive at times and can cause unpleasant side effects. But you&#8217;ll be in hospital when you’re most likely to feel unwell, and the staff can help if things get tough. Don’t feel you have to be brave. Be honest about how you&#8217;re feeling with your doctors and nurses. They can give you medicines to help you feel better.\nThere are different phases of treatment for AML:\n- getting rid of the leukaemia – remission induction\n- keeping the leukaemia away&nbsp;– consolidation and delayed intensification therapy\n- central nervous system (CNS) therapy (mainly for teenagers under 16)\nVery often, treatment is given as part of a clinical trial or research study, but it will be your decision whether to take part in the trial or not. Clinical trials help doctors to keep improving treatment for leukaemia. &nbsp;\nYou usually start chemotherapy pretty quickly after finding out that you have AML.\nYou&#8217;ll be in hospital for your treatment to begin with.&nbsp;If you&#8217;re 18 or younger, you&#8217;ll be treated in a specialist Principal Treatment Centre (PTC) for teenage and young adults (TYA).&nbsp;If you&#8217;re 19 or older, you&#8217;ll be offered the choice of having treatment at the PTC or another hospital closer to home called a TYA designated hospital.\nMost chemotherapy for AML is given into the bloodstream (intravenously). So you’ll have a ‘line’ put into one of your main veins to make it easier for you to have intravenous chemotherapy. There are different kinds of lines.\nYou’ll also be given chemotherapy into the fluid around your spinal cord and brain. This is to get rid of any leukaemia cells that might be hiding there. This type of treatment is called central nervous system (CNS) therapy.\nHaving chemotherapy can be hard, but the staff looking after you will give you medicines to help you cope with any side effects so you can stay strong enough to have treatment. And you’ll be given medicines to help you feel less sick and antibiotics to help prevent infections.\nThere will probably be times when you feel rough and other times when you’ll feel better. You might also feel upset, down or irritable. Talking to someone you trust can help you cope with these feelings.\nBeing in hospital for long periods can be frustrating, especially when you miss out on stuff happening at school, college, university or work or on things your friends are doing. You could try talking to your friends and family about this and see what they can do to help you.\nThe first phase of your treatment is about getting rid of the leukaemia. You’ll be given chemotherapy to kill as many leukaemia cells as possible. Remission means there is no sign of leukaemia cells in your blood or bone marrow.\nYou have chemotherapy over a few days, then you have a few weeks off so that your body can recover from any side effects. The days you have the chemotherapy and the rest period afterwards is called a cycle. You’ll usually have&nbsp;4 cycles of chemotherapy overall with&nbsp;2 courses in the induction phase. Some people might also need to have a bone marrow transplant. This normally happens after 2 cycles of chemotherapy.\nYou&#8217;ll probably need to stay in hospital most of the time that you’re having remission induction. This is so that the doctors can check how things are going.\nDrugs you may have include:\n- cytarabine (Ara-C)\n- daunorubicin, doxorubicin or idarubicin\n- etoposide\n- thioguanine\nDifferent chemotherapy can cause different side effects.\nAs well as the chemotherapy drugs, you’ll be given other drugs to:\n- help prevent you from feeling sick or being sick\n- help prevent infections\n- protect your kidneys as sometimes when lots of leukaemia cells are destroyed at once it can cause kidney problems\nYou’ll probably also need blood and platelet transfusions to top up the numbers of red cells and platelets in your blood.\nChemotherapy can cause side effects. Most of them are short-term (temporary) and gradually disappear once treatment stops. The most common side effects are:\n- being more at risk of infections\n- feeling sick\n- hair loss\n- a sore mouth\nSometimes side effects can be long-term. For example, some chemotherapy treatments can affect fertility (your ability to have a baby). If you are a young man, you will be offered the chance to store sperm before chemotherapy is started. There may be other late effects of treatment and your specialist can talk to you about this.\nRemission induction is pretty intense treatment and you’ll probably feel a bit wiped out sometimes. You’ll need to stay in hospital for most of the time and you might not have the energy to do much. You might feel fed up, tearful or irritable. It’s normal to feel like this. It&#8217;s hard to be in hospital and you might worry about losing touch with your friends or falling behind at school or college. It can help to talk about this with a friend, doctor, nurse or counsellor.\nThis phase of treatment is sometimes also called consolidation or intensification treatment. It’s given to prevent the leukaemia from returning (known as a relapse).\nWhen you’re in remission, it means the doctors can’t see any leukaemia cells in your blood or bone marrow samples under the microscope. But there may still be leukaemia cells hiding in your body, so further treatment is needed to get rid of these cells.\nYou start post-remission treatment soon after you complete remission induction. You’ll usually have&nbsp;2 courses of treatment. You might be given the same chemotherapy drugs you’ve had before (perhaps at similar or higher doses) or you might be given different chemotherapy drugs.\nWhen your doctors decide what chemotherapy treatment plan to give you, they will take into account:\n- how well your leukaemia responded to the first lot of treatment (remission induction)\n- the results of the tests that were done when you were diagnosed\nThe following drugs may be used to treat you:\n- cytarabine (ara-C)\n- methotrexate\nYou usually won’t need this treatment if you’re 16 or over. But if you’re under 16, you’ll probably have it.\nCNS therapy is given to get rid of any leukaemia cells that might be in the brain or spinal cord. (The CNS or central nervous system is the name for the brain and spinal cord.)\nCNS therapy involves giving chemotherapy into the fluid, called cerebrospinal fluid or CSF, around the spinal cord and brain.\nIt’s a bit like having a lumbar puncture but with chemotherapy added. A doctor puts a needle into the space between two small bones (vertebrae) near the bottom of your spine. Then they inject chemotherapy into the CSF. The CSF will carry the chemotherapy around your CNS so it can reach any leukaemia cells that might be there.\nYou’ll have a lumbar puncture before you start treatment to check for leukaemia cells in the CSF.\nIf there is no sign of leukaemia cells, you’ll have&nbsp;2 lots of CNS therapy,&nbsp;1 after each cycle of remission induction therapy.\nIf there are leukaemia cells in the CSF, you’ll have CNS therapy twice a week until all traces of leukaemia cells in your CSF have gone. You’ll then have&nbsp;2 more lots of CNS therapy just to make sure.\nFor CNS therapy for AML, you’ll have chemotherapy drugs called methotrexate and cytarabine and a steroid called hydrocortisone.\nThe most common side effect is feeling sick but you can be given anti-sickness treatment to help this. Rarer side effects include a headache, dizziness, tiredness or blurry vision for a few hours afterwards.\nWe also have more information about:\n- symptoms and causes of AML&nbsp;\n- having tests for AML&nbsp;\n- leukaemia, blood cells and bone marrow\nIf you&#8217;re looking for information about AML in people of all ages, read our general AML section."

        "disease": "Acute pancreatitis",
        "description": "Acute pancreatitis is a serious condition where the pancreas becomes inflamed over a short period of time. The pancreas is a small organ located behind the stomach and below the ribcage.\nMost people with&nbsp;acute pancreatitis improve within a week and experience no further problems, but severe cases can have serious complications and can even be fatal.\nAcute pancreatitis is different to&nbsp;chronic pancreatitis, where the inflammation of the pancreas persists for many years.\nThe most common symptoms of acute pancreatitis include:\n- suddenly getting severe pain in the centre of your abdomen (tummy)\n- feeling or being sick\n- diarrhoea\nRead more about the&nbsp;symptoms of acute pancreatitis&nbsp;and diagnosing acute pancreatitis.\nContact your GP immediately if you suddenly develop severe abdominal pain. If this isn&#8217;t possible, contact NHS 24&#8217;s 111&nbsp;service&nbsp;or your local&nbsp;out-of-hours service for advice.\nIt&#8217;s thought that acute pancreatitis occurs when a problem develops with some of the enzymes (chemicals) in the pancreas, which causes them to&nbsp;try to digest&nbsp;the organ.\nAcute&nbsp;pancreatitis&nbsp;is most often linked to:\n- gallstones – which accounts for around half of all cases\n- alcohol consumption – which accounts for about a quarter of all cases\nBy reducing your alcohol intake and altering your diet to make gallstones less likely, you can&nbsp;help to reduce your chances of developing acute pancreatitis.\nRead more about the&nbsp;causes of acute pancreatitis&nbsp;and preventing acute pancreatitis.\nAcute pancreatitis&nbsp;is more common in middle-aged and elderly people, but it can affect people of any age.\nMen are more likely to develop alcohol-related pancreatitis, while women are more likely to develop it as a result of gallstones.\nTreatment for acute pancreatitis focuses on supporting the functions of the body until the inflammation has passed.\nThis&nbsp;usually involves admission to hospital so you can be given fluids into a vein (intravenous fluids), as well as pain relief, nutritional support and oxygen through tubes into your nose.\nMost people with acute pancreatitis improve within a week and are well enough to leave hospital after 5 to 10 days.\nHowever, recovery takes longer in severe cases, as complications&nbsp;that require additional treatment&nbsp;may develop.\nRead more about&nbsp;treating acute pancreatitis.\nAbout 4&nbsp;out of 5&nbsp;cases of acute pancreatitis improve quickly and&nbsp;don&#8217;t cause any serious further problems. However, 1&nbsp;in 5&nbsp;cases are severe and&nbsp;can result in life-threatening complications, such as&nbsp;multiple organ failure.\nIn severe cases where&nbsp;complications develop, there&#8217;s a high&nbsp;risk of&nbsp;the condition&nbsp;being fatal.\nIf a person survives the effects of severe acute pancreatitis, it&#8217;s likely to be several weeks or months before they&#8217;re well enough to leave hospital.\nRead more about the possible&nbsp;complications of acute pancreatitis.\nThe main symptom of acute pancreatitis is a severe, dull pain around the top of your stomach that develops suddenly.\nThis aching pain often gets steadily worse and can travel along your back or below your left shoulder blade. Eating or drinking&nbsp;may also make you feel worse very quickly, especially fatty foods.\nLeaning forward or curling into a ball may help to relieve the pain, but lying flat on your back often increases the pain.\nAcute pancreatitis caused by gallstones usually develops after eating a large meal. If the condition is caused by alcohol, the pain often develops 6 to 12 hours after drinking a significant amount of alcohol.\nOther symptoms of acute pancreatitis can include:\n- nausea (feeling sick) or vomiting\n- diarrhoea\n- indigestion\n- a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above\n- jaundice – yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes\n- tenderness or swelling of the abdomen (tummy)\nContact your GP immediately if you suddenly develop severe abdominal pain. If this isn&#8217;t possible, contact NHS 24 111 Service or your local out-of-hours service for advice.\nMost cases of acute pancreatitis are closely linked to gallstones or to alcohol consumption, although the exact cause isn&#8217;t always clear.\nGallstones are hard pieces of stone-like material that form in your gallbladder. They can trigger acute pancreatitis if they move out of the gallbladder and block the opening of the pancreas.\nThe blockage can disrupt some of the enzymes (chemicals) produced by the pancreas. These enzymes are normally used to help digest food in your intestines, but they&nbsp;can&nbsp;start to digest the pancreas instead if&nbsp;the opening is&nbsp;blocked.\nHowever, not everyone with gallstones will develop acute pancreatitis. Most gallstones don&#8217;t cause any problems.\nIt&#8217;s not fully understood how alcohol causes the pancreas to become inflamed. One theory is that it interferes with the normal workings of the pancreas, causing the enzymes to start digesting it.\nWhatever the cause, there is a clear link between alcohol use and acute pancreatitis. A very large study found that people who regularly drank more than 35 units of alcohol&nbsp;a week were 4&nbsp;times more likely to develop acute pancreatitis than people who never drank alcohol (35 units is the equivalent&nbsp;of drinking around 16 cans of strong lager or 4&nbsp;bottles of wine a week).\nBinge drinking,&nbsp;which is drinking a lot of alcohol in a short period of time, is also thought to increase your risk of developing acute pancreatitis.\nLess common causes of acute pancreatitis include:\n- accidental damage or injury to the pancreas – for example, during&nbsp;a procedure&nbsp;to&nbsp;remove gallstones or examine the pancreas\n- certain types of medication,&nbsp;such as some antibiotics or chemotherapy medication – acute pancreatitis can be&nbsp;an unexpected side effect of these in a small number of people\n- a viral infection – such as mumps&nbsp;or measles\n- a complication of cystic fibrosis\n- certain rare conditions – including hyperparathyroidism, Reye&#8217;s syndrome&nbsp;and Kawasaki disease\nLittle is known about why some people develop severe acute pancreatitis. Factors thought to increase your risk include:\n- being 70 years of age or over\n- being obese&nbsp;(a person is considered obese if they have a&nbsp;body mass index (BMI) of 30 or above)\n- having 2&nbsp;or more alcoholic drinks a day\n- smoking\nResearchers have also discovered that people with a specific genetic mutation, known as the MCP-1 mutation, are 8&nbsp;times more likely to develop severe acute pancreatitis than the general population. A genetic mutation is where the instructions (DNA) found in all living cells become scrambled, resulting in a genetic disorder or a change in characteristics.\nMost cases of acute pancreatitis are diagnosed in hospital because of the risk of serious complications.\nThe doctor in charge of your care will ask you about the history of your symptoms. They may also carry out a physical examination. If you have acute pancreatitis, certain areas of your abdomen will be very tender to touch.\nA blood test will be carried out to help confirm a diagnosis. This&nbsp;can detect signs of acute pancreatitis,&nbsp;such as&nbsp;a high level of 2&nbsp;chemicals called lipase and amylase.\nAt first, it can be difficult to tell whether your acute pancreatitis is mild or severe. You&#8217;ll be monitored closely for signs of serious problems, such as organ failure.\nPeople with mild acute pancreatitis tend to improve within a week and experience either no further problems or problems that resolve within 48 hours. People with severe acute pancreatitis develop persistent serious problems.\nSeveral tests may be used to help determine the severity of your condition and&nbsp;assess your risk of developing more serious complications.\nYou may have any of the following tests:\n- a computerised tomography (CT) scan – where a series of X-rays are taken to build up a more detailed, 3D image of your pancreas\n- a&nbsp;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan – where strong magnetic fields and radio waves are used to produce a detailed image of the inside of your body\n- an ultrasound scan – where high-frequency sound waves are used to create an image of part of the inside of the body\n- endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)\nAn ERCP uses a narrow, flexible tube known as an endoscope, which has a camera on one end. The endoscope will be passed through your mouth and towards your stomach. A special dye that shows up on&nbsp;X-rays is then injected through the endoscope into your bile and pancreatic ducts. After the dye has been injected, X-rays will be taken.\nThis test can be useful in cases of gallbladder-associated acute pancreatitis, because it can pinpoint exactly where the gallstone is located. In some cases, it may be possible to pass surgical instruments down the endoscope, so the gallstone can be removed.\nAcute pancreatitis is treated in hospital, where you&#8217;ll be closely monitored for signs of serious problems and given supportive treatment, such as fluids and oxygen.\nMany people are well enough to leave hospital after 5 to 10 days.\nIn severe cases, complications can develop that require specific additional treatment and you&#8217;ll need to be admitted to a high dependency unit or intensive care unit (ICU). In these cases, recovery&nbsp;may take much longer, and the condition can be fatal.\nRead about the potential&nbsp;complications of acute pancreatitis for more information&nbsp;on severe cases.\nYour body can become dehydrated during an episode of acute pancreatitis, so fluids are provided through a tube connected to one of your veins (this is known as intravenous, or IV, fluid).\nIn severe cases of acute pancreatitis, IV fluids can help to prevent a serious problem called hypovolemic shock, which occurs when a drop in your fluid levels lowers the amount of blood in your body.\nAlthough the diet of many people with mild acute pancreatitis isn&#8217;t restricted, some&nbsp;people are advised not to&nbsp;eat. This is because trying to digest solid food could place too much strain on your pancreas.\nDepending on the severity of the condition, you may not be able to eat solid foods&nbsp;for a few days or longer.\nIf you&nbsp;need to avoid solid food, a feeding tube may be&nbsp;used to provide your body with nutrients. This is known as enteral feeding and&nbsp;often involves using&nbsp;a tube inserted into your stomach through your nose (nasogastric tube).\nTo ensure your vital organs have enough oxygen, it will usually be supplied through tubes into your nose. The tubes can be removed after a few days, once your condition is improving.\nIn severe cases, ventilation equipment may also be used to assist with your breathing.\nAcute pancreatitis often causes severe abdominal (tummy) pain, so strong painkilling medication will probably be required, such as morphine.&nbsp;\nSome of the painkillers used can make you feel very drowsy. If you&#8217;re visiting someone who is in hospital with acute pancreatitis, don&#8217;t be alarmed or concerned if they appear drowsy or unresponsive.\nOnce the condition is under control, the underlying cause may need to be treated.\nIf a&nbsp;gallstone is responsible for the pancreatitis,&nbsp;you may need&nbsp;a procedure called&nbsp;endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP),&nbsp;or your gallbladder may need to be removed.\nGallbladder removal surgery&nbsp;may be done while you&#8217;re in hospital, or it&nbsp;may be planned for several weeks&#8217; time. Having your gallbladder removed should have no significant effect on your health, other than making it more difficult to digest certain foods, such as fatty or spicy foods.\nAn ERCP procedure is an alternative treatment for gallstones. It involves using a narrow, flexible tube known as an endoscope, which has a camera on one end.\nX-rays&nbsp;guide the endoscope into your digestive system, and&nbsp;surgical instruments&nbsp;are passed&nbsp;down the endoscope&nbsp;to remove&nbsp;the gallstones.\nAfter recovering from acute pancreatitis, alcohol should be completely avoided&nbsp;if this was the cause of the condition. If you find this difficult, you&#8217;ll probably need additional treatment.\nTreatment options for alcohol dependence include:\n- one-to-one&nbsp;counselling\n- self-help groups – such as Alcoholics Anonymous\n- a medication called acamprosate – which helps to reduce your alcohol cravings\nAlthough most people with acute pancreatitis recover without experiencing further problems, severe cases can have serious complications.\nPseudocysts are sacs of fluid that can develop on the surface of the pancreas. They&#8217;re a common complication of acute pancreatitis, thought to affect around 1 in 20 people with the condition.\nPseudocysts usually develop 4 weeks after the symptoms of acute pancreatitis start. In many cases, they don&#8217;t cause any symptoms and are only detected during a computerised tomography (CT) scan.\nHowever, in some people, pseudocysts can cause bloating, indigestion and a dull abdominal (tummy) pain.\nIf the pseudocysts are small and not causing any symptoms, there may be no need for further treatment, as they usually go away on their own.\nTreatment is usually recommended if you&#8217;re experiencing symptoms or if&nbsp;the pseudocysts are large. Larger pseudocysts are at risk of bursting, which could cause internal bleeding or trigger an infection.\nPseudocysts can be treated by draining the fluid out of the cyst by inserting a needle into&nbsp;it through your skin. This can also be done by carrying out an endoscopy, where&nbsp;a thin, flexible tube called an endoscope is passed down your throat, and tiny tools are used to drain away the fluid.\nIn around 1&nbsp;in 3&nbsp;severe cases of acute pancreatitis,&nbsp;a serious complication called infected pancreatic necrosis occurs.\nIn infected pancreatic necrosis, high levels of inflammation cause an interruption to the blood supply of your pancreas. Without a consistent supply of blood, some of the tissue of your pancreas will die. Necrosis is the medical term for the death of tissue.\nThe dead tissue is extremely vulnerable to infection from bacteria. Once an infection has occurred, it can quickly spread into the blood (blood poisoning) and cause multiple organ failure. If left untreated, infected pancreatic necrosis is almost always fatal.\nInfected pancreatic necrosis usually develops 2&nbsp;to 6&nbsp;weeks after the&nbsp;symptoms of acute pancreatitis starts. Symptoms include increased abdominal pain and a high temperature. The infection&nbsp;is treated with injections of antibiotics, and the dead tissue needs to be removed to prevent the infection returning.\nIn some cases, it may be possible to drain away the dead tissue using a thin tube called a catheter, which is placed through the skin.\nAlternatively, laparoscopic surgery (keyhole surgery) can be used.&nbsp;A small cut&nbsp;is made in your back and an endoscope is inserted to wash away any dead tissue. If laparoscopic surgery&nbsp;isn&#8217;t possible, a cut&nbsp;can be&nbsp;made in your abdomen to allow the dead tissue to be removed.\nInfected pancreatic necrosis is a very serious complication. Even with the highest standards of medical care, the risk of dying from organ failure is estimated to be around 1&nbsp;in 5.\nAnother common complication of severe acute pancreatitis is systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). SIRS develops in an estimated 1 in 10 severe cases of acute pancreatitis.\nIn SIRS, the inflammation affecting the pancreas spreads throughout the body, which can cause one or more organs to fail. It usually develops during the first week after the&nbsp;symptoms start, with most cases developing on the same day.\nSymptoms of SIRS include:\n- a rise in body temperature to above 38C (100.4F) or a fall in body temperature to below 36C (96.8F)\n- a rapid heartbeat of more than 90 beats a minute\n- an unusually fast breathing rate (more than 20 breaths a minute)\nThere&#8217;s currently no cure for SIRS, so treatment involves trying to support the body&#8217;s functions until the inflammation has passed. The outcome depends on how many organs fail. The higher the number of organs affected, the greater the risk of death.\nIf you have repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis, the damage to your pancreas may lead to chronic pancreatitis.\nChronic pancreatitis is a long-term condition that can have a serious impact on your quality of life.\nAs acute pancreatitis is often caused by gallstones or excessive alcohol consumption, a healthy lifestyle can reduce your chances of developing the condition.\nThe most effective way&nbsp;of preventing&nbsp;gallstones is eating a healthy, balanced&nbsp;diet that includes plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (at least 5&nbsp;portions a day).\nYour diet should also include wholegrains, found in wholemeal bread, oats and brown rice. This helps lower the amount of cholesterol in your body.&nbsp;\nThere is also evidence that regularly eating nuts, such as peanuts or cashews, can help reduce your risk of developing gallstones.\nBecause of the role cholesterol appears to play in the formation of gallstones, it&#8217;s advisable to avoid eating too many fatty foods with a high cholesterol content.\nFoods high in cholesterol include:\n- meat pies\n- sausages and fatty cuts of meat\n- butter and lard\n- cakes and biscuits\nBeing overweight also increases your chances of developing gallstones, so maintaining a healthy&nbsp;weight by eating a&nbsp;balanced diet and taking plenty of regular exercise can also&nbsp;help reduce your risk of developing&nbsp;the condition.\nRead more information and advice about exercise, healthy eating and losing weight.\nLimiting the amount of alcohol you drink can help prevent your pancreas being damaged, and reduce your risk of developing acute pancreatitis. It can also lower your chances of developing other serious conditions, such as liver cancer.\nRead the pages on&nbsp;drinking and alcohol&nbsp;for more information and advice."

        "disease": "Addison’s disease",
        "description": "Addison’s disease (also known as primary adrenal insufficiency or hypoadrenalism) is a rare disorder of the adrenal glands.\nThe adrenal glands are 2 small glands that sit on top of the kidneys. They produce essential hormones: cortisol, aldosterone and adrenaline.\nIn Addison&#8217;s disease, the adrenal gland is damaged, and not enough cortisol and aldosterone are produced.\nAbout 8,400 people in the UK have Addison&#8217;s disease. It can affect people of any age. It&#8217;s most common between the ages of 30 and 50. It&#8217;s also more common in women than men.\nEarly-stage symptoms of Addison’s disease are similar to other more common health conditions, such as&nbsp;depression or flu.&nbsp;You may experience:\n- fatigue (lack of energy or motivation)\n- muscle weakness\n- low mood\n- loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss\n- increased thirst\nOver time, these&nbsp;problems may become more severe and you may experience further symptoms, such as dizziness, fainting,&nbsp;cramps&nbsp;and exhaustion. You may also develop small areas of darkened skin, or darkened lips or gums.\nAlthough these symptoms aren’t always caused by Addison’s disease, you should&nbsp;see your GP, so they can be investigated.\nRead more about the symptoms of Addison’s disease&nbsp;and diagnosing Addison’s disease\nThe condition is usually the result of a problem with the immune system, which causes it to attack the outer layer of the adrenal gland (the adrenal cortex), disrupting the production of steroid hormones aldosterone and cortisol. It&#8217;s not clear why this happens, but it&#8217;s responsible for 70% to 90% of cases in the UK.\nOther potential causes include conditions that can damage the adrenal glands, such as&nbsp;tuberculosis (TB), although this is uncommon in the UK.\nRead more about the causes of Addison’s disease\nAddison’s disease is treated with medication to replace the missing hormones. You&#8217;ll need to take the medication for the rest of your life.\nWith treatment, symptoms of Addison&#8217;s disease can largely be controlled. Most people with the condition live a normal lifespan and&nbsp;are able to&nbsp;live an active life, with few limitations.\nHowever,&nbsp;many people with Addison&#8217;s disease also find they must learn to manage&nbsp;bouts of fatigue and there may be associated health conditions, such as&nbsp;diabetes or an underactive thyroid.\nPeople with Addison&#8217;s disease must be aware&nbsp;of the risk of a sudden worsening of symptoms, called an adrenal crisis. This&nbsp;can happen&nbsp;when the levels of cortisol&nbsp;in your body fall&nbsp;significantly due to not taking your medicines, or during another illness.\nAn adrenal crisis is a medical emergency and warning signs include severe nausea, confusion, fever, headache and weakness. If left untreated, it can be fatal. If you or someone you know has Addison’s disease and is experiencing severe symptoms, phone 999 for an ambulance.\nRead more about treating Addison&#8217;s disease\nIf you have Addison&#8217;s disease, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).\nThis helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.\nFind out more about the register\nAddison&#8217;s disease can be difficult to detect at first, because early symptoms are similar to symptoms of many other health conditions.\nInitial symptoms of Addison&#8217;s disease can&nbsp;include:\n- fatigue (lack of energy or motivation)\n- lethargy (abnormal drowsiness or tiredness)\n- muscle weakness\n- low mood (mild depression) or irritability\n- loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss\n- the need to urinate frequently\n- increased thirst\n- craving for salty foods\nDehydration&nbsp;can also be an early sign of Addison’s disease. It&#8217;s caused by lack of the hormone aldosterone in your body, which is used to regulate the balance of salt and water.\nFurther&nbsp;symptoms of Addison’s disease tend to develop gradually over months or years. However,&nbsp;additional stress, caused by another illness or an accident, for example, may cause your symptoms to suddenly get worse.\nYou may go on to develop:\n- low blood pressure&nbsp;when you stand up, which can cause dizziness and fainting&nbsp;\n- feeling sick (nausea)\n- vomiting\n- diarrhoea\n- abdominal,&nbsp;joint or back pain\n- muscle cramps&nbsp;\n- chronic exhaustion, which may cause depression\n- brownish discolouration of the skin, lips&nbsp;and gums (hyperpigmentation), particularly in the creases on your palms, on scars or on pressure points, such as your knuckles or knees\n- a&nbsp;reduced libido (lack of interest in sex), particularly in women\nSome women may also have irregular periods&nbsp;or miss some periods completely.&nbsp;Children with Addison&#8217;s disease may experience puberty&nbsp;later than usual.\nSome people with Addison&#8217;s disease also develop low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia). This can cause symptoms such as&nbsp;difficulty concentrating, confusion, anxiety and even unconsciousness (particularly in children).\nIf you&#8217;re experiencing&nbsp;symptoms of Addison&#8217;s disease, see your GP so they can diagnose or rule out the condition.&nbsp;These symptoms&nbsp;will usually improve with&nbsp;appropriate treatment.\nRead more about&nbsp;diagnosing Addison&#8217;s disease and treating Addison&#8217;s disease\nIf Addison’s disease is left untreated, the levels of hormones produced by the adrenal gland&nbsp;gradually decrease in the body. This causes your symptoms to get progressively worse and eventually lead to a life-threatening situation&nbsp;called&nbsp;an adrenal or Addisonian crisis.\nDuring an adrenal crisis, the symptoms of Addison’s disease appear quickly and&nbsp;severely. This could happen when&nbsp;you&#8217;re already experiencing initial symptoms or without any symptoms at all.\nSigns of an adrenal crisis include:\n- severe dehydration\n- pale, cold, clammy skin\n- sweating\n- rapid, shallow breathing\n- dizziness\n- severe vomiting and diarrhoea\n- severe muscle weakness\n- headache\n- severe drowsiness or loss of consciousness\nAn adrenal crisis is a medical emergency. If left untreated, it can be fatal. If you think you or someone you know&nbsp;with Addison’s disease&nbsp;is having an adrenal crisis, phone 999 for an ambulance.\nIf an adrenal crisis isn&#8217;t treated, it can lead to a&nbsp;coma and death. There&#8217;s also a risk your brain won&#8217;t get enough oxygen if treatment is delayed, which&nbsp;can cause permanent disability.\nAddison&#8217;s disease develops when the outer layer of your adrenal glands (your adrenal cortex) is damaged, reducing the levels of hormones it produces.\nIn the UK, a problem with the immune system is the most common cause of Addison&#8217;s disease, accounting for 70% to 90% of cases.\nThe&nbsp;immune system is your body’s defence against infection and disease. If you&#8217;re ill, your immune system produces antibodies (a special type of protein that destroys disease-carrying organisms and toxins). These antibodies attack the cause of the illness.\nHowever, if you develop a problem with your immune system, it can start to attack your own healthy tissues and organs. This is known as an autoimmune disorder.\nAddison’s disease can develop if your immune system attacks your adrenal glands and severely damages your adrenal cortex. When 90% of the adrenal cortex is destroyed, your adrenal glands won&#8217;t be able to produce enough of the steroid hormones cortisol and aldosterone. Once levels of these start decreasing, you&#8217;ll experience symptoms of Addison’s disease.\nIt&#8217;s not clear why some people develop this problem with their immune system, although it can run in families.\nResearch has shown that some people with&nbsp;certain genes&nbsp;are more likely to develop autoimmune disorders.\nIt&#8217;s not clear how these genes lead to Addison&#8217;s disease&nbsp;and&nbsp;similar conditions, but it does mean&nbsp;your risk of developing Addison&#8217;s disease is increased if you or a&nbsp;close family member&nbsp;have another autoimmune condition, such as:\n- vitiligo – a chronic (long-term) condition that causes pale, white patches to develop on the skin\n- type 1 diabetes – a chronic condition caused by too much glucose in the blood&nbsp;&nbsp;\n- underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)&nbsp;\nTuberculosis (TB)&nbsp;is the most common cause of Addison&#8217;s disease worldwide, but is rare in the UK. TB is a bacterial infection that mostly affects the lungs, but can also spread to other parts of your body.&nbsp;It can cause Addison’s disease if it damages your adrenal glands.\nOther possible causes of Addison’s disease include:\n- infections – such as those linked to AIDS, or fungal infections\n- a haemorrhage – very heavy bleeding into the adrenal glands, sometimes associated with meningitis&nbsp;or other types of severe sepsis\n- cancer – if&nbsp;cancer cells from elsewhere in your body spread to your adrenal glands\n- amyloidosis – a disease where amyloid, a protein produced by your bone marrow cells, builds up in your adrenal glands and damages them\n- surgical removal of&nbsp;both adrenal glands (adrenalectomy) – for example, to remove a tumour\n- adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) – a rare, life-limiting, inherited condition affecting the adrenal glands and nerve cells in the brain that&nbsp;most often&nbsp;affects young boys\n- certain treatments needed for Cushing&#8217;s syndrome – a collection of symptoms caused by very high levels of cortisol in the body\nTo help diagnose Addison’s disease, your GP will first ask about your symptoms and review your medical history.\nThey&#8217;re also likely to ask if anyone in your family has&nbsp;an autoimmune disorder (a condition caused by a problem with their immune system).\nYour GP will examine your skin for any evidence of brownish discolouration (hyperpigmentation), particularly in certain areas, such as:\n- where skin creases on your palm\n- in your elbow crease\n- on any scars\n- your lips and gums\nHowever, hyperpigmentation doesn&#8217;t occur in all cases of Addison’s disease.\nYou&#8217;ll also be tested for&nbsp;low blood pressure (hypotension) while you&#8217;re lying down and again shortly after you stand up. This is to see whether you have postural or orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure when you change position).\nIf Addison’s disease is suspected,&nbsp;blood tests will be carried out to measure the levels of&nbsp;sodium, potassium and cortisol&nbsp;in your body. A low sodium, high potassium or low cortisol level may indicate&nbsp;Addison’s disease.\nYou may need to see a hospital hormone specialist (endocrinologist) for your blood&nbsp;to be tested for the following:\n- a low level of the hormone aldosterone\n- a high level of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)\n- a low level of glucose (sugar used for energy)\n- positive adrenal antibodies (antibodies designed to attack the adrenal gland)\nAny of these could be a sign of Addison’s disease.\nIf cortisol&nbsp;in your blood&nbsp;is&nbsp;low, or your symptoms strongly suggest Addison’s disease, you&#8217;ll need to have a synacthen stimulation test to confirm the diagnosis.\nYour GP may refer you to an endocrinology unit (a unit that specialises in the study of hormones) for the test. How urgently you&#8217;re referred depends on how severe your symptoms are.\nSynacthen is a man-made (synthetic) copy of the adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). ACTH is naturally produced by the pituitary gland (a pea-sized gland below the brain) to encourage the adrenal glands to release the hormones cortisol and aldosterone.\nWhen synacthen is administered, the adrenal glands should respond in the same way as they would to ACTH, and release cortisol and&nbsp;other steroid hormones&nbsp;into the blood.\nA blood sample will be taken and tested for cortisol, before an injection of&nbsp;synacthen is given into your arm. After 30 and 60 minutes, a further&nbsp;blood sample will be taken for cortisol measurement.\nIf the ACTH level is high, but the cortisol and aldosterone levels are low, it&#8217;s usually confirmation of Addison’s disease.\nAs well as a synacthen stimulation test, your thyroid gland may also be tested to see if it&#8217;s working properly.\nYour thyroid gland is found in your neck. It produces hormones that control your body&#8217;s growth and metabolism.\nPeople with Addison’s disease often have an&nbsp;underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism), where the thyroid gland does not produce enough hormones. By testing the levels of certain hormones in your blood, your endocrinologist (a specialist in hormone conditions) can determine whether you have hypothyroidism.\nIn some cases, your specialist may refer you for a scan of your adrenal glands. This could be a computerised tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.\nIf Addison’s disease is left untreated, it eventually leads to an adrenal crisis. This is where&nbsp;the&nbsp;symptoms of Addison’s disease appear quickly and severely.\nDuring an adrenal crisis, there&#8217;s not enough time to perform a synacthen stimulation test to confirm Addison’s disease.\nIf possible, blood will be taken and tested for any of the abnormalities listed above. While you&#8217;re waiting for the results, treatment may be started with steroid injections, and fluids containing salt and glucose.\nRead more about treating&nbsp;Addison’s disease\nIf you&#8217;re diagnosed with Addison&#8217;s disease and&nbsp;have a bus, coach or lorry licence, it&#8217;s your legal obligation to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).\nRead&nbsp;about&nbsp;driving and&nbsp;Addison&#8217;s disease&nbsp;on the GOV.UK website.\nIf you have Addison’s disease, you&#8217;ll need to take daily medication to replace the lost hormones. This should help you to live an active life, although many people find they still need to manage their fatigue.\nIn&nbsp;some cases, the underlying causes of Addison’s disease can be treated. For example,&nbsp;tuberculosis (TB) is treated with a course of&nbsp;antibiotics over a period of at least 6 months.\nHowever, most cases are caused by a problem with the immune system that can&#8217;t be cured.\nTreatment usually involves corticosteroid (steroid) replacement therapy for life. Corticosteroid medication is used to replace the hormones cortisol and aldosterone that your body no longer produces. It&#8217;s usually taken in tablet form 2 or 3 times a day.\nIn most cases, a medication called&nbsp;hydrocortisone&nbsp;is used to replace the cortisol. Other possible medicines are&nbsp;prednisolone or dexamethasone, though these are less commonly used.&nbsp;\nAldosterone is replaced with a medication called fludrocortisone. Your GP may also ask you to add extra salt to your daily diet, although if you&#8217;re taking enough fludrocortisone medicine this&nbsp;may not be necessary.&nbsp;Unlike most people, if you feel the urge to eat something salty, then you should eat it.\nIn general, the medications used for Addison&#8217;s disease don&#8217;t have side effects, unless your dose is too high. If you take a higher dose than necessary for a long time, there&#8217;s a risk of problems such as weakened bones (osteoporosis), mood swings and difficulty sleeping (insomnia).\nMany people with Addison’s disease find&nbsp;that taking their medication enables them to continue&nbsp;with their&nbsp;normal diet and exercise routines. However, bouts of fatigue are also common, and it can&nbsp;take some time to learn how to manage these periods of low energy.\nSome people find that needing to take regular doses of medication is restrictive and affects their daily life or emotional health.&nbsp;Missing a dose of medication, or taking it late,&nbsp;can also lead to exhaustion or insomnia.\nSome people can develop associated health conditions, such as&nbsp;diabetes or an underactive thyroid, which require extra treatment and management.\nYou&#8217;ll usually need to have appointments with an endocrinologist every 6 to 12 months, so they can review your progress and adjust your medication dose, if necessary.&nbsp;Your GP can provide support and repeat prescriptions in between these visits.\nFailing to take your medication could lead to a serious condition called an adrenal crisis, so&nbsp;you must:\n- remember to collect your repeat prescriptions\n- keep spare medication as necessary – for example, in the car or at work, and always carry some spare medication with you\n- take your medication every day at the right time\n- pack extra medication if you are going away – usually double what you would normally need, plus your injection kit (see below)\n- carry your medication in your hand luggage if you are travelling by plane, with a note from your doctor explaining why it is necessary\nYou could also inform close friends or colleagues of your condition. Tell them about the signs of adrenal crisis and what they should do if you experience one.\nIt&#8217;s also a good idea to wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace that informs people&nbsp;you have Addison’s disease.\nAfter a serious accident, such as a car crash, a healthy person produces more&nbsp;cortisol. This helps you cope with the stressful situation and additional strain on your body that results from serious injury. As your body cannot produce cortisol, you&#8217;ll need a hydrocortisone injection to replace it and prevent an adrenal crisis.\nWearing a medical alert bracelet will inform any medical staff&nbsp;treating you about your condition, and what medication you require.\nMedical alert bracelets or necklaces are pieces of jewellery engraved with your medical condition and an emergency contact number. They are available from a number of retailers. Ask your GP if there&#8217;s one they recommend, or go to the&nbsp;MedicAlert website.&nbsp;\nIf you need to stay in hospital, the healthcare professionals responsible for your care will also need to know you need steroid replacement medication throughout your stay. It&#8217;s important to note that this advice still applies if you&#8217;re not supposed to eat or drink (nil by mouth) for any reason.\nAt certain times, your medication may need to be adjusted to take into account any additional strain on your body. For example, you may need to increase the dosage of your medication if you experience any of the following:\n- an illness or infection – particularly if you have a high temperature of 37.5C (99.5F)\n- an accident, such as a car crash\n- an operation, dental or medical procedure (such as a tooth filling or endoscopy)\n- you&#8217;re taking part in strenuous exercise&nbsp;not usually part of your daily life\nThis will help your body cope with the additional stress. Your endocrinologist will monitor your dosage and advise about any changes. Over time, as you get used to the condition and learn what can trigger your symptoms, you may learn how to adjust your medication yourself. However, always consult your GP or specialist if you&#8217;re unsure.\nYou and a partner or family member may be trained to administer an injection of hydrocortisone in an emergency.\nThis could be necessary if you go into shock&nbsp;after an injury, or if you experience vomiting or diarrhoea and are unable to keep down oral medication. This may occur if you&#8217;re pregnant and have morning sickness. Your&nbsp;endocrinologist will discuss with you when an injection might be necessary.\nIf you need to administer emergency hydrocortisone, always phone your GP immediately afterwards. Check what&nbsp;out-of-hours services are available in your local area, in case the emergency is outside normal working hours.\nYou can also&nbsp;register yourself with your local ambulance service, so they have a record of your requirement for a steroid injection or tablets, if you need their assistance.\nAdrenal crisis, or Addisonian crisis, needs urgent medical attention. Phone 999 for an ambulance if you or someone you know are experiencing adrenal crisis.\nSigns of an adrenal crisis include:\n- severe dehydration\n- pale, cold, clammy skin\n- sweating\n- rapid, shallow breathing\n- dizziness\n- severe vomiting and diarrhoea\n- severe muscle weakness\n- headache\n- severe drowsiness or loss of consciousness\nIn hospital, you&#8217;ll be given lots of fluid through a vein in your arm to rehydrate you. This will contain a mixture of salts and sugars (sodium, glucose and dextrose) to replace those that your body is lacking. You&#8217;ll also be injected with hydrocortisone to replace the missing cortisol hormone.\nAny underlying causes of the adrenal crisis, such as an infection, will also be treated."

        "disease": "Alcohol-related liver disease",
        "description": "Alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) refers to liver damage caused by excess alcohol intake. There are several stages of severity and a range of associated symptoms.\nARLD&nbsp;doesn&#8217;t usually cause any symptoms until the liver has been severely damaged. When this happens, symptoms can include:\n- feeling sick\n- weight loss\n- loss of appetite\n- yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice)\n- swelling in the ankles&nbsp;and tummy\n- confusion&nbsp;or drowsiness\n- vomiting blood or passing blood in your stools\nThis means ARLD is frequently diagnosed during tests for other conditions, or at a stage of advanced liver damage.\nIf you&nbsp;regularly drink alcohol to excess, tell your GP so they can check if your liver is damaged.\nRead more about:\n- symptoms of ARLD\n- diagnosing ARLD\nWith the exception of the brain, the liver is the most complex organ in the body.&nbsp;Its functions include:\n- filtering toxins from the blood\n- aiding digestion of food\n- regulating blood sugar and cholesterol levels\n- helping fight infection and disease\nThe liver is very resilient and capable of regenerating itself. Each time your liver filters alcohol, some of the liver cells die.\nThe liver can develop new cells, but prolonged&nbsp;alcohol misuse&nbsp;(drinking too much)&nbsp;over many years can reduce its ability to regenerate. This can&nbsp;result in serious and&nbsp;permanent damage to your liver.\nARLD is&nbsp;very common in the UK&nbsp;–&nbsp;the number of people with the condition has been increasing over the last few decades&nbsp;as a result of&nbsp;increasing levels of alcohol misuse.\nRead more about the&nbsp;causes of ARLD.\nThere are 3&nbsp;main stages of&nbsp;ARLD, although there&#8217;s often an overlap between each stage.&nbsp;These stages are explained below.\nDrinking a large amount&nbsp;of alcohol, even for just a few days, can lead to a build-up of fats in the liver. This is&nbsp;called alcoholic fatty liver disease, and is the first stage of ARLD.\nFatty liver disease rarely causes any symptoms, but it&#8217;s an important warning sign that you&#8217;re drinking at a harmful level.\nFatty liver disease is reversible. If you stop drinking alcohol for 2&nbsp;weeks, your liver should return to normal.\nAlcoholic&nbsp;hepatitis&nbsp;– which is unrelated to infectious hepatitis&nbsp;–&nbsp;is a potentially serious condition that can be caused by alcohol misuse over a longer period. When this develops, it may be the first time a person is aware they&#8217;re damaging their liver through alcohol.\nLess commonly, alcoholic hepatitis can occur if you drink a large amount of alcohol in a short period of time (binge drinking).\nThe liver damage associated with mild alcoholic hepatitis is usually reversible if you stop drinking permanently.\nSevere alcoholic hepatitis, however, is a serious&nbsp;and life-threatening illness. Many people die from the condition each year in the UK, and some people only find out they have liver damage when their condition reaches this stage.\nCirrhosis&nbsp;is a stage of&nbsp;ARLD where the liver has become significantly scarred.&nbsp;Even at this stage, there may not be any obvious symptoms.\nIt&#8217;s generally not reversible, but stopping drinking alcohol immediately can prevent further damage and significantly increase your life expectancy.\nA person who has&nbsp;alcohol-related cirrhosis and doesn&#8217;t stop drinking has a less than 50% chance of living for at least 5&nbsp;more years.\nThere&#8217;s currently no specific medical treatment for ARLD. The main treatment is to stop drinking, preferably for the rest of your life. This reduces the risk of&nbsp;further damage to your liver and&nbsp;gives&nbsp;it the best chance of recovering.\nIf&nbsp;a person is&nbsp;dependent on alcohol, stopping drinking can be very difficult. However, support, advice and medical treatment may be available through local alcohol&nbsp;support services.\nA&nbsp;liver transplant may be required in severe cases where the liver has stopped functioning and doesn&#8217;t improve when you stop drinking alcohol.\nYou&#8217;ll only be considered for a liver transplant if you&#8217;ve developed complications of&nbsp;cirrhosis, despite having stopped drinking. All liver transplant units require a person to not drink alcohol while awaiting the transplant, and for the rest of&nbsp;their life.\nRead more about&nbsp;treating ARLD.\nDeath rates linked to ARLD have&nbsp;risen considerably over the last&nbsp;few decades. Alcohol is now one of the most common causes of death in the UK, along with&nbsp;smoking and high blood pressure.\nLife-threatening complications of ARLD include:\n- internal (variceal) bleeding\n- build-up of toxins in the brain (encephalopathy)\n- fluid accumulation in the abdomen (ascites) with associated kidney failure\n- liver cancer\nRead more about the complications of ARLD.\nThe most effective way to prevent ARLD is to stop drinking alcohol or stick to the low-risk drinking guidelines.\nEven if you&#8217;ve been a heavy drinker for many years, reducing or stopping your alcohol intake will have important short- and long-term benefits for your liver and overall health.\nRead our drinking and alcohol pages for more information and advice.\nIn many cases, people with alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) don&#8217;t have any noticeable symptoms until their liver is badly damaged.\nIf you do experience early symptoms of ARLD, these&nbsp;are often quite vague, such as:\n- abdominal pain\n- loss of appetite\n- fatigue\n- feeling sick\n- diarrhoea\n- feeling generally unwell\nAs&nbsp;the liver becomes more severely damaged, more obvious and serious symptoms can develop, such as:\n- yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)\n- swelling in the legs, ankles and feet, due to&nbsp;a build-up of fluid (oedema)\n- swelling in your abdomen, due to&nbsp;a build-up of fluid known as ascites\n- a high temperature (fever)&nbsp;and shivering attacks\n- very itchy skin\n- hair loss\n- unusually curved fingertips and nails (clubbed fingers)\n- blotchy red&nbsp;palms\n- significant weight loss\n- weakness and muscle wasting\n- confusion and memory problems, trouble sleeping (insomnia) and changes in your personality due to a build-up of toxins in the brain\n- vomiting blood and black, tarry stools due to&nbsp;internal bleeding\n- a tendency to bleed and bruise more easily, such as frequent nosebleeds and bleeding gums\n- increased sensitivity to alcohol and drugs (because the liver can&#8217;t process them)\nARLD doesn&#8217;t often cause symptoms until it&#8217;s reached an advanced stage. If you misuse alcohol, you may have liver damage, even though you have none of these symptoms.\nRead about alcohol misuse (drinking too much).&nbsp;\nContact your GP for advice&nbsp;if you have a history of regular alcohol misuse.\nA good way to assess your history and pattern of drinking is to use a short test known as the CAGE test, which consists of 4&nbsp;questions:\n- Have you ever thought you should cut down on your drinking?\n- Have people annoyed you by criticising your drinking?\n- Have you ever felt guilty about your drinking?\n- Have you ever drunk an &#8216;eye-opener&#8217;, which means: have you ever drunk alcohol first thing in the morning to get over a hangover and steady your nerves?\nIf you answer yes to 1 or more of the questions, you may have an alcohol problem and are advised to see your GP.\nSee your GP as soon as possible&nbsp;if you have symptoms of advanced ARLD.\nRead more about how ARLD is diagnosed.\nAlcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) is caused by drinking too much alcohol. The more you drink above the recommended limits, the higher your risk of developing ARLD.\nThere are 2&nbsp;ways alcohol misuse&nbsp;(drinking too much)&nbsp;can cause ARLD. These are:\n- drinking a large amount of alcohol in a short amount of time (binge drinking) can cause fatty liver disease and, less commonly, alcoholic hepatitis\n- drinking more than the recommended limits of alcohol over many years can cause&nbsp;hepatitis and cirrhosis, the more serious types of ARLD\nEvidence suggests people who regularly drink more than the recommended maximum amounts are most at risk of developing ARLD.\nRead more about alcohol units and how to calculate them.\nAs well as drinking excessive amounts of alcohol, other factors can increase your chances of developing ARLD. These&nbsp;include:\n- being overweight or obese\n- being female&nbsp;–&nbsp;women appear to be more vulnerable than men to the harmful effects of alcohol\n- having a pre-existing liver condition, such as&nbsp;hepatitis C&nbsp;\n- genetics&nbsp;–&nbsp;alcohol dependence and problems processing alcohol often run in families\nAlcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) is often first suspected when tests for other medical conditions show a damaged liver.\nThis is because&nbsp;the condition&nbsp;causes few obvious symptoms in the early stages.\nIf a doctor suspects ARLD, they&#8217;ll usually arrange a blood test to check how well your liver is working. They may also ask about your alcohol consumption.\nIt&#8217;s important to be totally honest about how much and how often you drink alcohol to avoid further unnecessary testing. This could lead to a delay in the treatment you need.\nBlood tests&nbsp;used to assess the liver are known as liver function tests. However, liver function tests can be normal&nbsp;at many stages of liver disease.\nBlood tests can also detect if you have low levels of certain substances, such as a protein called serum albumin, which is made by the liver. A low level of serum albumin suggests your liver isn&#8217;t functioning properly.\nA blood test may also look for signs of abnormal blood clotting, which can indicate significant liver damage.\nLab Tests Online has more information on&nbsp;liver function tests.\nIf your symptoms or liver function test suggest an advanced form of ARLD – either alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis – you may need further tests.\nScans may be needed to&nbsp;produce detailed images of your liver. This may include:\n- an ultrasound scan\n- a computerised tomography (CT) scan\n- a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan\nSome scans may also measure the stiffness of the liver, which is a good indication of whether your liver is scarred.\nDuring a liver&nbsp;biopsy,&nbsp;a&nbsp;fine needle is inserted into your body (usually between your ribs). A small sample of liver cells is taken and sent to a laboratory to be examined under a microscope.\nThe&nbsp;biopsy is usually carried out under local anaesthetic, either as a day case or with an overnight stay in hospital.\nSpecialist doctors will examine the liver biopsy tissue under the microscope to determine the degree of scarring in the liver and the cause of the damage.\nAn endoscope is a long, thin, flexible tube with a light and a video camera at one end.&nbsp;During an endoscopy,&nbsp;the instrument is&nbsp;passed down your oesophagus (the long tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach) and into your stomach.\nPictures of your oesophagus and stomach are transmitted to an external screen. The doctor will be looking for swollen veins (varices), which are a sign of cirrhosis.\nSuccessful treatment for alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) often depends on whether someone is willing to stop drinking alcohol and make changes to their lifestyle.\nTreatment for&nbsp;ARLD involves stopping drinking alcohol. This is known as abstinence, which can be vital, depending on what stage the condition is at.\nIf you have fatty liver disease, the damage may be reversed if you abstain from alcohol for at least 2&nbsp;weeks. After this point, it&#8217;s usually safe to start drinking again if you stick to the&nbsp;NHS guidelines on alcohol consumption.\nIf you have a more serious form of ARLD – alcoholic hepatitis&nbsp;or cirrhosis – life-long abstinence is recommended.&nbsp;This is because stopping drinking is the only way to prevent your liver damage getting worse and potentially stop you dying of liver disease.\nStopping drinking isn&#8217;t easy, especially as an estimated 70% of people with ARLD have an alcohol dependency problem.\nNevertheless, if you have alcohol-related cirrhosis or alcoholic hepatitis and don&#8217;t stop drinking, no medical or surgical treatment can prevent liver failure.\nIf you&#8217;re abstaining from alcohol, you may suffer withdrawal symptoms. These will be at their worst for the first 48 hours, but should start to improve as your body adjusts to being without alcohol. This usually takes 3&nbsp;to 7&nbsp;days from the time of your last drink.\nMany people initially experience&nbsp;disturbed sleep when abstaining from alcohol, but&nbsp;in most cases their sleep pattern returns to normal within a month.\nIn some cases,&nbsp;you may be advised to reduce your alcohol intake in a gradual and planned way to help avoid withdrawal problems. You may also be offered&nbsp;a medication called a benzodiazepine and psychological therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), to help you through the withdrawal process.\nSome people&nbsp;need to stay in hospital or a specialist rehabilitation clinic during the initial withdrawal phases, so&nbsp;their&nbsp;progress can be closely monitored.\nIf you&#8217;re&nbsp;staying at home, you&#8217;ll regularly see a nurse or other health professional. You might see them at home, at your GP surgery or at a specialist NHS service.\nOnce you&#8217;ve stopped&nbsp;drinking, you may&nbsp;need further&nbsp;treatment to help ensure you don&#8217;t&nbsp;start drinking again.\nThe first treatment usually offered&nbsp;is psychological therapy. This involves&nbsp;seeing a therapist to talk about your thoughts and feelings, and how these affect your behaviour and wellbeing.\nIf psychological therapy alone isn&#8217;t effective, you may also need medication to help you abstain from alcohol, such as:&nbsp;\n- acamprosate\n- naltrexone\n- disulfiram\nRead our page on&nbsp;treating alcohol misuse&nbsp;for&nbsp;more information on the treatments offered.\nMany people with alcohol dependence find it useful to attend self-help groups to help them stop drinking. One of the most well-known is Alcoholics Anonymous, but there are&nbsp;many other groups that can help.\nRead the alcohol support page for more information about the help available.\nMalnutrition&nbsp;is common in people with ARLD, so it&#8217;s important to eat a&nbsp;balanced diet to help ensure you get all the nutrients you need.\nAvoiding salty foods and not adding salt to foods you eat can reduce your risk of developing swelling in your legs, feet and abdomen (tummy) caused by a build-up of fluid.&nbsp;\nThe damage to your liver can also mean it&#8217;s unable to store glycogen – a&nbsp;carbohydrate that provides short-term energy. When this happens, the body uses its own muscle tissue to provide energy between meals, which leads to muscle wasting and weakness. Therefore, you may need extra energy and protein in your diet.\nHealthy snacking between meals can top up your calories and protein. It may also be helpful to eat 3&nbsp;or 4&nbsp;small meals a day, rather than 1&nbsp;or 2&nbsp;large meals.\nYour GP can advise you on a suitable diet or, in some cases, refer you to a dietitian.\nIn the most serious cases of malnutrition, nutrients may need to be provided through a feeding tube&nbsp;inserted through the nose and into the stomach.\nThe use of medication to directly&nbsp;treat&nbsp;ARLD is controversial. Many experts have argued&nbsp;there&#8217;s limited evidence for its effectiveness.\nFor people with severe alcoholic hepatitis, treatment in hospital may be necessary. Specific treatment with&nbsp;corticosteroids&nbsp;or pentoxifylline medication may be used to reduce inflammation of the liver in some people with this condition.\nNutritional support is also an important part of treatment in these cases.\nOther medications that have been used to treat liver damage include:\n- anabolic steroids (a more powerful type of steroid medication)\n- ropylthiouracil (a type of medicine originally designed to treat overactive thyroid glands)\nHowever, there&#8217;s a lack of good evidence that these help and they&#8217;re no longer used for severe alcoholic hepatitis.\nIn the most serious cases of ARLD, the liver loses its ability to function, leading to&nbsp;liver failure. A&nbsp;liver transplant&nbsp;is currently the only way to cure irreversible liver failure.\nA liver transplant may be considered if:\n- you develop progressive liver failure, despite not drinking alcohol\n- you&#8217;re otherwise well enough to survive such an operation\n- you commit to not drinking alcohol for the rest of your life\nA number of serious complications can develop if you have alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD).\nPortal hypertension is a common complication of&nbsp;cirrhosis and, less commonly, alcoholic hepatitis.&nbsp;It occurs when&nbsp;the blood pressure inside your liver has risen to a potentially serious level.\nWhen the liver becomes severely scarred, it&#8217;s harder for blood to move through it. This leads to an increase in the pressure of blood around the intestines.\nThe blood must also find a new way to return to your heart. It does this by opening up new blood vessels, usually along the lining of your stomach or oesophagus (the long tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach). These new blood vessels are known as varices.\nIf the blood pressure rises to a certain level, it can become too high for the varices to cope with, causing the&nbsp;walls&nbsp;of the varices&nbsp;to split and bleed.\nThis can cause long-term bleeding, which can lead to&nbsp;anaemia.\nAlternatively, the bleeding can be rapid and massive, causing you to vomit blood and pass stools that are very dark or tar-like.\nSplit varices can be treated by using an&nbsp;endoscope to locate the varices. A tiny band can then be used to seal the base of the varices.\nA person with portal hypertension may also develop a build-up of fluid in their abdomen (tummy) and around&nbsp;the intestines. This fluid is known as ascites.\nInitially, this can be treated with water tablets (diuretics). If the problem progresses, many litres of fluid can build up, which needs to be drained. This is a procedure known as paracentesis and involves a long, thin tube being placed into the fluid through the skin under local anaesthetic.\nOne of the problems associated with the development of ascites is the risk of infection in the fluid (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis). This is a potentially very serious complication and is linked to an increased risk of kidney failure and death.\nOne of the most important functions of the liver is to remove toxins from your blood. If&nbsp;the liver is unable to do this due to hepatitis or cirrhosis, the levels of toxins in the&nbsp;blood increase. A high level of toxins in the blood due to liver damage is known as hepatic encephalopathy.\nSymptoms of hepatic encephalopathy include:\n- agitation\n- confusion\n- disorientation\n- muscle stiffness\n- muscle tremors\n- difficulty speaking\n- in very serious cases, a&nbsp;coma\nHepatic encephalopathy&nbsp;may require hospital admission. In hospital, body functions are supported and medication is used to remove toxins from the blood.\nLiver damage due to heavy drinking over many years can also increase your risk of developing&nbsp;liver cancer.\nOver the past few decades, rates of liver cancer in the UK have risen sharply due to increased levels of alcohol misuse. It&#8217;s estimated that, every year, 3-5% of people with&nbsp;cirrhosis will develop liver cancer."

        "disease": "Allergic rhinitis",
        "description": "Allergic rhinitis is inflammation (redness and swelling) of the inside of the nose. It&#8217;s caused by an allergen, such as pollen, dust, mould, or flakes of skin from certain animals.\nIt’s a very common condition. For most people it&#8217;s easy to treat with medicines from a pharmacist.\nAllergic rhinitis usually causes cold-like symptoms, such as:\n- sneezing\n- itchiness\n- a blocked or runny nose\nThese symptoms usually start soon after coming into contact with something you&#8217;re allergic to.\nSome people only get allergic rhinitis seasonally because they&#8217;re allergic to things like tree or grass pollen. Other people get allergic rhinitis all year round.\nYour GP will usually be able to diagnose allergic rhinitis from your symptoms and any triggers you may have noticed. If the cause of your condition is uncertain, you may be referred for allergy testing.\nTreatment for allergic rhinitis depends on how severe your symptoms are.\nIf you have mild allergic rhinitis, you can often treat the symptoms yourself.\nAlways read the leaflet that comes with your medicine before taking it. Follow the recommended dosage instructions. If you’re not sure which treatments are suitable for you or your child, speak to a pharmacist for advice.\nYou do not need to use all of the solution, but make a fresh solution each time you clean your nose.\nMedication won’t cure your allergy, but it can be used to treat the symptoms.\nSpeak to your GP practice if your symptoms do not improve 2 weeks after starting medicine. They may prescribe a stronger medication such as a nasal spray containing corticosteroids.\nAllergic rhinitis is caused by breathing in tiny particles that you&#8217;re allergic to. The most common allergens in the air that cause rhinitis are:\n- house dust mites\n- pollen and spores\n- flakes of animal skin\n- wood dust\n- flour dust\n- latex\nYou’re more likely to develop an allergy if there’s a history of allergies in your family.\nAllergic rhinitis can lead to complications in some cases. These include:\n- nasal polyps – abnormal but non-cancerous (benign) growths inside the nose and sinuses\n- sinusitis – inflammation that blocks the sinuses so mucus cannot drain into your nose as usual\n- blockage of the middle ear – due to a build-up of fluid behind the eardrum\nThese problems can often be treated with medication. Surgery is sometimes needed in severe or long-term cases."

        "disease": "Allergies",
        "description": "An allergy is a reaction the body has to a particular food or substance.\nAllergies are very common. They&#8217;re thought to&nbsp;affect more than 1&nbsp;in 4&nbsp;people in the UK at some point in their lives.\nThey&nbsp;are particularly common in children. Some allergies go away as a child gets older, although&nbsp;many are lifelong. Adults can develop allergies to things they weren&#8217;t previously allergic to.\nHaving an allergy can be a nuisance and affect your everyday activities, but most allergic reactions are mild and can be largely kept under control. Severe reactions can occasionally occur, but these are uncommon.\nSubstances that cause allergic reactions are called allergens.&nbsp;The more common allergens&nbsp;include:\n- grass and tree pollen&nbsp;– an allergy to these&nbsp;is known as hay fever (allergic rhinitis)\n- dust mites\n- animal dander (tiny flakes of skin or hair)\n- food&nbsp;– particularly&nbsp;nuts, fruit, shellfish, eggs and cow&#8217;s milk\n- insect bites and stings\n- medication –&nbsp;including&nbsp;ibuprofen, aspirin, and certain&nbsp;antibiotics\n- latex – used to make some gloves and condoms\n- mould&nbsp;– these can release small particles into the air that you can breathe in\n- household chemicals&nbsp;– including those in detergents and hair dyes\nMost of these&nbsp;allergens&nbsp;are generally harmless to people who aren&#8217;t allergic to them.\nAllergic reactions usually happen quickly within a few minutes of exposure to an allergen.\nThey can cause:\n- sneezing\n- a runny or blocked&nbsp;nose\n- red, itchy, watery eyes\n- wheezing and coughing\n- a red, itchy rash\n- worsening of&nbsp;asthma or&nbsp;eczema symptoms\nMost allergic reactions are mild, but occasionally a severe reaction called anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock can occur. This is&nbsp;a medical emergency and needs urgent treatment.\nRead more about the&nbsp;symptoms of allergies.\nIf you have allergies you can get advice and treatment directly from a pharmacy. Find your local pharmacy on Scotland&#8217;s Service Directory.\nIf your pharmacist thinks you might have a&nbsp;mild allergy, they can offer advice and treatment to help manage the condition. See your pharmacist if you think you or your child might have had an allergic reaction to something. The symptoms of an allergic reaction&nbsp;can also&nbsp;be caused by other conditions. Your pharmacist can help determine whether it&#8217;s likely you have an allergy.\nIf your allergy is particularly severe or it&#8217;s not clear what you&#8217;re allergic to, the pharmacist may advise you see your GP&nbsp;who may refer you to an allergy specialist for testing and advice about treatment.\nRead more about&nbsp;allergy testing.\nIn&nbsp;many cases, the most effective way of managing&nbsp;an allergy is to avoid the allergen that causes the reaction whenever possible.\nFor example, if you have a food allergy, you should check a food&#8217;s ingredients list for allergens before eating it. The Food Standards Agency has more information about food allergen labelling.\nThere are also several medications available to&nbsp;help control symptoms of allergic reactions, including:\n- antihistamines&nbsp;– these can be taken when you notice the symptoms of a reaction, or before being exposed to an allergen to stop a reaction occurring\n- decongestants&nbsp;– tablets, capsules, nasal sprays or liquids that can be used as a short-term treatment for a blocked nose\n- lotions and creams, such as&nbsp;moisturising creams (emollients)&nbsp;– these can&nbsp;reduce skin redness and itchiness\n- steroid medication&nbsp;– sprays, drops, creams, inhalers and tablets that can help reduce redness and swelling caused by an allergic reaction\nFor some people with very severe allergies, a treatment called immunotherapy may be recommended.\nThis involves being exposed to the allergen in a controlled way over a number of years, so your body gets used to it and doesn&#8217;t react to it so severely.\nRead more about&nbsp;treating an allergy and avoiding allergic reactions.\nAllergies&nbsp;occur when the body&#8217;s immune system reacts to a particular substance as though it&#8217;s harmful.\nIt&#8217;s not clear why this happens, but most people affected have a family history of allergies or have closely related conditions such as asthma or eczema.\nThe number of people with allergies is increasing every year. The reasons for this are not understood, but one of the main theories is it&#8217;s the result of living in a cleaner, germ-free environment, which reduces the number of germs our immune system has to deal with.\nIt&#8217;s thought this may&nbsp;cause it to overreact when it comes into contact with harmless substances.\nSymptoms of an allergic reaction usually develop within a few minutes of being exposed to something you&#8217;re allergic to, although occasionally they can develop gradually over a few hours.\nAlthough&nbsp;allergic reactions&nbsp;can be a nuisance and hamper your normal activities, most are mild. Very occasionally, a severe reaction called anaphylaxis can occur.\nCommon symptoms of an allergic reaction include:\n- sneezing and an itchy, runny or blocked nose (allergic rhinitis)\n- itchy, red, watering eyes (conjunctivitis)\n- wheezing,&nbsp;chest tightness, shortness of breath&nbsp;and a cough\n- a raised, itchy, red rash (hives)\n- swollen&nbsp;lips, tongue, eyes&nbsp;or face\n- tummy pain, feeling sick, vomiting&nbsp;or diarrhoea\n- dry, red and cracked skin\nThe symptoms vary depending on what you&#8217;re allergic to and how you come into contact with it. For example, you&nbsp;may&nbsp;have a runny nose&nbsp;if exposed to pollen, develop&nbsp;a rash if you have a skin allergy, or feel sick&nbsp;if you eat something you&#8217;re allergic to.\nSee your pharmacist if you or your child might have had an allergic&nbsp;reaction to something. They can help determine whether the symptoms are caused by an allergy or another condition. Read more about diagnosing allergies.\nIn rare cases, an allergy can lead to a severe allergic reaction, called anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock, which can be life-threatening.\nThis affects the whole body and usually&nbsp;develops within minutes of exposure to something you&#8217;re allergic to.\nSigns of anaphylaxis include any of the symptoms above, as well as:\n- swelling of the throat and mouth\n- difficulty breathing\n- lightheadedness\n- confusion\n- blue skin or lips\n- collapsing and losing consciousness\nAnaphylaxis is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment. Read more about&nbsp;anaphylaxis for information about what to do if it occurs.\nIf you think you have an allergy, tell your pharmacist about the symptoms you&#8217;re having, when they happen, how often they occur and if anything seems to trigger them. Your pharmacist can offer advice and treatment for mild allergies with a clear cause.\nIf your allergy is more severe or it&#8217;s not obvious what you&#8217;re allergic to, your pharmacist may advise you to see your GP as you may need referred&nbsp;for allergy testing at a specialist allergy clinic.\nThe tests that may be carried out are described below.\nSkin prick testing is one of the most common allergy tests.\nIt involves putting a drop of liquid onto your forearm that contains a substance you may be allergic to. The skin under the drop is then gently pricked with a needle. If you are allergic to the substance, an itchy, red bump will appear within 15 minutes.\nSkin prick testing is painless and very safe. Make sure you don&#8217;t take antihistamines before the test, as they can interfere with the results.\nBlood tests may be used instead of, or alongside, skin prick tests to help diagnose common allergies.\nA sample of your blood is removed and analysed for specific antibodies produced by your immune system in response to an allergen.\nPatch&nbsp;tests&nbsp;are used to investigate a type of eczema known as contact dermatitis, which can be caused by your skin being exposed to an allergen.\nA small amount of the suspected allergen is added to special metal discs, which are then taped to your skin for 48 hours and monitored for a reaction.\nIf you have a suspected&nbsp;food allergy, you may be advised to avoid eating a particular food to see if your symptoms improve.\nAfter a few weeks, you may then be asked to eat the food again to check if you have another reaction.\nDon&#8217;t attempt to do this&nbsp;yourself without discussing it with a qualified healthcare professional.\nIn a few cases, a test called a&nbsp;food challenge may also be used&nbsp;to diagnose a food allergy.\nDuring the test, you&#8217;re given the food you think you&#8217;re allergic to in gradually increasing amounts, to see how you react under close supervision.\nThis test is riskier than other forms of testing, as it could cause a severe reaction, but is the most accurate way to diagnose food allergies. And challenge testing is always carried out in a clinic where a severe reaction can be treated if it does develop.\nThe treatment for an allergy depends on what you&#8217;re allergic to. In many cases your pharmacist will be able to offer advice and treatment.\nThey&#8217;ll advise you about taking steps to avoid exposure to the substance you&#8217;re allergic to, and&nbsp;can recommend medication to control your symptoms.\nThe best way to keep your symptoms under control is often to avoid the things you&#8217;re allergic to,&nbsp;although this isn&#8217;t always practical.\nFor example, you&nbsp;may be able to help&nbsp;manage:\n- food allergies&nbsp;by being careful about what you eat\n- animal allergies by keeping pets outside as much as possible and washing them regularly\n- mould allergies by&nbsp;keeping your home dry and well-ventilated, and dealing with any damp and condensation\n- hay fever by&nbsp;staying indoors and avoiding grassy areas when the pollen count is high\n- dust mite allergies by&nbsp;using allergy-proof duvets and pillows, and fitting wooden floors rather than carpets\nRead more about preventing allergic reactions.\nMedications for mild allergies are available from pharmacies on the Pharmacy First Scotland service without a prescription, but always ask your pharmacist for advice before starting any new medicine, as they&#8217;re not suitable for everyone.\nAntihistamines&nbsp;are the main medicines for allergies. They&nbsp;can be used:\n- as and when you notice&nbsp;the symptoms of&nbsp;an allergic reaction\n- to prevent allergic reactions&nbsp;– for example, you may take them in the morning&nbsp;if you have hay fever and you know the pollen count is high that day\nAntihistamines&nbsp;can be taken&nbsp;as tablets, capsules, creams, liquids, eye drops or nasal sprays, depending on which part of your body is affected by your allergy.\nDecongestants&nbsp;can be used as a short-term treatment for a blocked nose caused by an allergic reaction.\nThey&nbsp;can be taken as tablets, capsules, nasal sprays or liquids. Don&#8217;t use them for more than a week at a time, as using them for long periods can make your symptoms worse.\nRed and itchy skin caused by an allergic reaction can sometimes be treated with over-the-counter creams and lotions, such as:\n- emollients (moisturising creams)&nbsp;to keep the skin moist and protect it from allergens\n- calamine lotion to reduce itchiness\n- steroids to reduce inflammation (see below)\nSteroid medications&nbsp;can help reduce inflammation caused by an allergic reaction.&nbsp;They&#8217;re available as:\n- nasal sprays and eye drops for an inflamed&nbsp;nose and eyes\n- creams for&nbsp;eczema and&nbsp;contact dermatitis\n- inhalers for&nbsp;asthma\n- tablets for&nbsp;hives (urticaria)\nSprays, drops and weak steroid creams are available without a prescription. Stronger creams,&nbsp;inhalers and tablets are available on prescription from your GP.\nImmunotherapy may be an option for a small number of people with certain severe and persistent allergies who are unable to control their symptoms using the measures above.\nThe treatment involves being given occasional small doses of the allergen – either as an injection, or as drops or tablets under the tongue&nbsp;– over the course of several years.\nThe injection&nbsp;can only be performed in a specialist clinic under the supervision of a doctor, as there is a small risk of a severe reaction. The drops or tablets can usually be&nbsp;taken at home.\nThe aim of treatment is to help&nbsp;your body get used to the allergen so it doesn&#8217;t react to it so severely.&nbsp;This won&#8217;t necessarily cure&nbsp;your allergy, but it will make it milder and mean you can take less medication.\nSome people with severe allergies may experience life-threatening reactions,&nbsp;known as&nbsp;anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock.\nIf you&#8217;re at risk of this, you&#8217;ll be given special injectors containing a medicine called adrenaline to use in an emergency.\nIf you develop symptoms of anaphylaxis, such as difficulty breathing, you should inject yourself in the outer thigh before seeking emergency medical help.\nRead more about the treating anaphylaxis.\nThe best way to prevent an allergic reaction is to avoid the substance that you&#8217;re allergic to, although this isn&#8217;t always easy or practical.\nBelow is some practical advice that should help you avoid the most common allergens.\nOne of the biggest causes of allergies are dust mites, which are tiny insects found in household dust. You can limit the number of mites in your home by:&nbsp;\n- choosing wood or hard vinyl floor coverings instead of a carpet\n- fitting roller blinds that can be easily wiped clean\n- choosing&nbsp;leather, plastic or vinyl furniture instead of upholstered furniture\n- cleaning cushions, soft toys, curtains and upholstered furniture regularly, either by washing (at a high temperature) or vacuuming\n- using tested allergy-proof covers on mattresses, duvets and pillows\n- using a vacuum cleaner fitted with a HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filter, because it can trap more dust mites than ordinary vacuum cleaners\n- regularly wiping surfaces with a damp, clean cloth&nbsp;– avoid dry dusting, as this can spread dust into the air\nConcentrate your efforts of controlling dust mites in the areas of your home where you spend the most time, such as the bedroom and living room.\nYou can find more information on indoor allergies in the home on the Allergy UK website.\nIt&#8217;s not the pet fur that causes an allergic reaction. Instead, it&#8217;s flakes of their dead skin, saliva and dried urine.\nIf you can&#8217;t permanently remove a pet from the house, you could try:&nbsp;\n- keeping pets outside as much as possible, or limiting them to a particular area of the house, preferably&nbsp;an area&nbsp;without carpet\n- not allowing pets in bedrooms\n- washing pets at least once a&nbsp;week\n- regularly grooming&nbsp;pets outside\n- regularly washing all bedding and soft furnishings on which a pet has lain\n- using an air filter in rooms where you spend most of your time\n- increase ventilation with fans, air-conditioning or by opening windows\nIf you&#8217;re visiting a friend or relative with a pet, ask them not to dust or vacuum on the day you&#8217;re visiting, as this will stir up the allergens into the air. Taking an antihistamine medicine about an hour before entering a pet-inhabited house can also help reduce your symptoms.\nThe Allergy UK website has more information about domestic pet allergies.\nTiny particles released by moulds can cause an allergic reaction in some people.\nYou can help prevent this by:\n- keeping your home dry and well-ventilated\n- removing any indoor pot plants from your home\n- not drying clothes indoors, store clothes in damp cupboards or packing clothes too tightly in wardrobes\n- dealing with any damp and condensation in your home\n- avoiding damp buildings, damp woods and rotten leaves, cut grass and compost heaps\nBy law, food manufacturers must clearly label any foods that contain something that&#8217;s known to cause allergic reactions in some people. By carefully checking the label for the list of ingredients, you should be able to avoid an allergic reaction.\nPeople with food allergies&nbsp;most often experience an allergic reaction while eating out at a restaurant. You can avoid this by:\n- not relying on the menu description alone (remember, many sauces or dressings could contain allergens)\n- communicating clearly with the waiting staff and asking for their advice\n- avoiding places where there&#8217;s a chance that different types of food could come into contact with each other, such as buffets or bakeries\n- let restaurant staff you know your dietary requirements, including how severe your food allergy or intolerance is\n- always check what allergens are in the dish even if you have eaten it before, as recipes and ingredients can change\nRemember, simple dishes are less likely to contain &#8220;hidden&#8221; ingredients. If you&#8217;re not sure about a dish, don’t risk it&nbsp;\nRead more about living with a food allergy&nbsp;and advice from the Food Standards Agency on&nbsp;food allergen&nbsp;labelling.\nPollen allergies – more commonly known as hay fever – are caused when trees and grasses release pollen into the air. Doctors often call hay fever allergic rhinitis.&nbsp;\nDifferent plants pollinate at different times of the year, so the months that you get hay fever will depend on what sort of pollen(s) you are allergic to. Typically, people are affected during spring (trees) and summer (grasses).\nTo&nbsp;help&nbsp;keep your hay fever under control,&nbsp;you can:\n- check weather reports for the pollen count and stay indoors when it&#8217;s high, if possible\n- avoid drying clothes&nbsp;and bedding outside when the pollen count is high\n- wear wraparound sunglasses to protect your eyes\n- keep doors and windows shut when possible\n- shower and change your clothes after being outside\n- avoid grassy areas, such as parks and fields&nbsp;–&nbsp;particularly in the early morning, evening or night, when the pollen count is highest\n- if you have a lawn,&nbsp;try asking someone else to cut the grass for you&nbsp;\nIf you&#8217;ve ever suffered a bad reaction to an insect bite or sting, it&#8217;s important to take precautions to minimise your risk.\nWhen you&#8217;re outdoors, particularly in the summer, you could:\n- cover exposed skin\n- wear shoes\n- apply insect repellent\n- avoid wearing strong perfumes or fragrances, as these can attract insects\nRead more about preventing insect bites and stings.\nIf you&#8217;re&nbsp;at risk of experiencing a&nbsp;severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), make sure you carry two adrenaline auto-injectors&nbsp;with you&nbsp;everywhere.\nWearing a MedicAlert or Medi-Tag medallion or bracelet can make others aware of your allergy in an emergency.\nConsider telling your teachers, work colleagues and friends, so they can give you your adrenaline injection in an emergency, while waiting for an ambulance.\nRead more about preventing anaphylaxis."

        "disease": "Alzheimer’s disease",
        "description": "Dementia is an umbrella term for a range of conditions that affect different brain functions, including memory. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common type of dementia.\nAlzheimer’s disease is most common in people over 65. But, people under 65 can also develop it.\nAlzheimer&#8217;s affects slightly more women than men.\nAlzheimer’s disease is a progressive condition. This means the symptoms develop gradually and become more severe over time.\nThe first sign of Alzheimer’s disease is usually minor memory problems. For example, a loss of interest and enjoyment in day-to-day activities. It&#8217;s also common to forget about recent conversations, events or the names of places.\nAs the condition develops, memory problems become more severe.\nOther changes caused by Alzheimer&#8217;s disease that could cause you concern include:\n- confusion, disorientation and getting lost in familiar places\n- difficulty planning or making decisions\n- problems with speech and language\n- problems moving around without help\n- difficulty performing self-care tasks\n- stress and distress\n- hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren’t there)\n- delusions (believing things that are untrue)\n- low mood or anxiety\nAlzheimer&#8217;s disease is thought to be caused by the build up of amyloid and tau. These are substances found inside the brain.\nAmyloid and tau build up and form tiny structures called plaques and tangles. These make it harder for the brain to work properly.\nOver time, Alzheimer&#8217;s disease causes parts of the brain to get smaller. It also reduces chemicals in the brain that are used to send messages around the brain.\nEventually, the brain struggles to cope with the damage. This can lead to problems with memory and thinking.\nOver time, damage also spreads to different areas of the brain. The first areas affected are the ones that are responsible for memories.\nThe exact cause of Alzheimer’s disease is unknown. But, many things could increase your risk of developing the condition. These include:\n- increasing age\n- having had a severe head injury in the past\n- in very rare cases, a family history of the condition\nIf you’re worried about your memory or think you may have dementia, you should speak to your GP.\nIf you’re worried about someone else, you should encourage them to make an appointment at their GP practice. You could suggest that you&#8217;ll go with them.\nMore advice if you&#8217;re worried about dementia\nMemory problems are not only caused by dementia. They can also be caused by depression, stress, medications or other health problems.\nYour GP can carry out some simple checks to try to find out what the cause may be. They can refer you to a specialist for more tests, if necessary.\nThere’s currently no cure for Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. But, there are treatments that can help manage the symptoms. Your GP or healthcare professional can discuss the best treatment options for you.\nThere are things you can do to live well for as long as possible with dementia.\nRead more about living well with dementia\nYour future health and social care needs will need to be assessed and a care plan drawn up.\nThis is a way of ensuring you receive the right treatment for your needs. It involves identifying areas where you may need some help, like:\n- what support you or your carer need for you to remain as independent as possible\n- whether there are any changes that need to be made to your home to make it easier to live in\n- whether you need any financial assistance"

        "disease": "Anal cancer",
        "description": "Anal cancer is a rare type of cancer that affects the very end of the large bowel.\nThe symptoms of anal cancer are often similar to more common and less serious conditions affecting the anus, such as piles&nbsp;(haemorrhoids)&nbsp;and&nbsp;anal fissures&nbsp;(small tears or sores).\nSymptoms of anal cancer can include:\n- bleeding from the bottom (rectal bleeding)\n- itching and pain around the anus\n- small lumps around the anus\n- a discharge of mucus from the anus\n- loss of bowel control&nbsp;(bowel incontinence)\nHowever, some people with anal cancer don’t have any symptoms.&nbsp;\nSpeak to your GP if you develop any of the above symptoms. While they’re unlikely to be caused by anal cancer, it’s best to get them checked out.\nYour GP will usually ask about your symptoms and carry out some examinations.\nThey may feel your tummy and carry out a rectal examination. This involves your doctor inserting a gloved finger into your&nbsp;bottom so they can&nbsp;feel any abnormalities. Your GP will refer you&nbsp;to hospital if they think further tests are necessary.&nbsp;\nThe&nbsp;National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends in its&nbsp;2015 guidelines&nbsp;that GPs should consider referring someone with an unexplained anal lump&nbsp;or&nbsp;anal ulcer. The person should receive an appointment within 2 weeks.\nIf you’re referred to&nbsp;hospital, a number of different tests may be carried out to check for anal cancer and rule out other conditions.\nSome of the tests you may have include a:\n- sigmoidoscopy –&nbsp;where a thin, flexible tube with a small camera and light is inserted into your bottom to check for any abnormalities\n- proctoscopy –&nbsp;where the inside of your rectum is examined using a hollow tube-like instrument (proctoscope) with a light on the end\n- biopsy&nbsp;–&nbsp;where a small tissue sample is removed from your anus during a sigmoidoscopy or proctoscopy so it can be examined in a laboratory under a microscope&nbsp;\nIf these tests suggest you have anal cancer, you may have some scans to check whether the cancer has spread. Once these are complete, your doctors will be able to ‘stage’ the cancer. This means giving it a score to describe how large it is and how far it has spread.\nYou can read more about the&nbsp;stages of anal cancer&nbsp;on the&nbsp;Cancer Research UK website.\nIf you’re diagnosed with anal cancer, you’ll be cared for by a multidisciplinary team. This is a team of different specialists who work together to provide the best treatment and care.\nThe main treatments used for anal cancer are:\n- chemoradiation – a combination of&nbsp;chemotherapy&nbsp;and&nbsp;radiotherapy\n- surgery – to remove a tumour or a larger section of bowel\nIn cases where the cancer has spread and can’t be cured, chemotherapy alone may be considered to help relieve symptoms. This is known as&nbsp;palliative care.\nChemoradiation is a treatment that combines chemotherapy (cancer-killing medication) and radiotherapy (where&nbsp;radiation&nbsp;is used to kill cancer cells). It’s currently the most effective treatment for anal cancer. You don’t usually need to stay in hospital when you’re having chemoradiation.\nChemotherapy for anal cancer is usually given in 2 cycles, each lasting 4 to 5 days, with a 4-week gap between the cycles. In many cases, part of the chemotherapy is delivered through a small tube called a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) in your arm, which can stay in place until your&nbsp;treatment has finished.\nThe tube means you don’t need to stay in&nbsp;hospital during each of the cycles of chemotherapy. However, you’ll be attached to a small plastic pump, which you take home with you.\nA few hospitals now offer tablet chemotherapy for anal cancer, which avoids the need for the pump and PICC.\nRead more about&nbsp;how chemotherapy is carried out\nRadiotherapy is usually given in short sessions, once a day from Monday to Friday, with a break at weekends. This is usually carried out for 5 to 6 weeks. To prepare for radiotherapy, additional scans will be required.\nRead more about&nbsp;how radiotherapy is carried out\nBoth chemotherapy and radiotherapy often cause significant side effects, including:\n- tiredness\n- sore skin around the anus\n- sore skin around the penis and scrotum in men or vulva in women\n- hair loss&nbsp;– limited hair loss from the head, but total loss from the pubic area\n- feeling sick\n- diarrhoea\nThese side effects are usually temporary, but there’s also a risk of longer-term problems, such as&nbsp;infertility. If you’re concerned about the potential side effects of treatment, you should discuss this with your care team before treatment begins.&nbsp;\nOther possible long-term side effects can include:\n- bowel control problems\n- long-term (chronic)&nbsp;diarrhoea\n- erectile dysfunction\n- vaginal pain when having sex\n- dry and itchy skin around the groin and anus\n- bleeding from the anus, rectum, vagina or bladder\nTell your doctor if you develop any of these symptoms so they can be investigated and treated.\nSurgery is a less common treatment option&nbsp;for anal cancer. It’s usually only considered if the tumour is small and can be easily&nbsp;removed, or if chemoradiation hasn’t worked.\nIf the tumour is very small and clearly defined,&nbsp;it may be cut out during a procedure called a local excision. This is a relatively simple procedure, carried out under&nbsp;general anaesthetic, that usually only requires a&nbsp;stay in hospital of a few days.\nIf chemoradiation has been unsuccessful or the cancer has returned after treatment, a more complex operation called an abdominoperineal resection may be recommended. As with a local excision, this operation is carried out under general anaesthetic.\nAn&nbsp;abdominoperineal resection involves removing your anus, rectum, part of the colon, some surrounding muscle tissue, and sometimes some of the surrounding lymph nodes (small glands that form part of the immune system) to reduce the risk of the cancer returning. You’ll usually need to stay in hospital for up to 10 days after this type of surgery.\nDuring the operation,&nbsp;a&nbsp;permanent&nbsp;colostomy&nbsp;will also be formed to allow you to pass stools. This is where a&nbsp;section of the large intestine is diverted through an opening made in the abdomen called a stoma. The stoma is attached to a special pouch that will collect your stools after the operation.\nBefore and after the operation, you’ll see a specialist nurse who can offer support and advice to help you adapt to life with a colostomy. Adjusting to life with a colostomy can be challenging, but most people become accustomed to it over time.\nRead more about living with a colostomy\nAfter your course of treatment ends, you’ll need to have&nbsp;regular follow-up appointments to monitor your recovery and check for any signs of the cancer returning.\nTo start with, these appointments will be every few weeks or months, but they’ll gradually&nbsp;become less frequent over time.\nThe exact cause of anal cancer is unknown, although a number of factors can increase your risk of developing the condition. These include:\n- infection with&nbsp;human papilloma virus (HPV)&nbsp;– a common and usually harmless group of viruses spread through sexual contact, which can affect the moist membranes lining your body\n- having anal sex or lots of&nbsp;sexual partners – possibly because this increases your risk of&nbsp;developing HPV\n- having a history of&nbsp;cervical,&nbsp;vaginal&nbsp;or&nbsp;vulval cancer\n- smoking\n- having a weakened immune system – for example, if you have&nbsp;HIV\nYour risk of developing anal cancer increases as you get older, with half of all cases diagnosed in people aged 65 or over. The condition is also slightly more common in women than men.\n- Cancer Research UK: Anal cancer\n- Macmillan Cancer Support: Anal cancer"

        "disease": "Anaphylaxis",
        "description": "Anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can develop rapidly.\nIt is also known as anaphylactic shock.\nSigns of anaphylaxis include:\n- itchy skin or a raised, red skin rash\n- swollen eyes, lips, hands and feet\n- feeling lightheaded or faint\n- swelling of the mouth, throat or tongue, which can cause breathing and swallowing difficulties\n- wheezing\n- abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting\n- collapse and unconsciousness\nAnaphylaxis should always be treated as a medical emergency. If available, an injection of a medicine called adrenaline&nbsp;should be given as soon as possible.\nSome people with a previous history of anaphylaxis will have an auto-injector of adrenaline.\nThis should be injected into their outer thigh muscle and held in place for 5 to 10 seconds. Instructions for how to use these auto-injectors can be found on the side of each device.\nYou should call 999 for an ambulance whether adrenaline has been given or not.\nIf after 5 to 10 minutes the person still feels unwell, a second injection should be given. This should be given in the opposite thigh.\nA second dose may also be needed if the person improves and then becomes unwell again.\nThe person should lie flat, with their legs raised on a chair or a low table. If they are having difficulty breathing, they should sit up to make breathing easier.\nIf the person is unconscious, you should move them&nbsp;to the&nbsp;recovery position&nbsp;– on their side, supported by one leg and one arm, with the head tilted back and the chin lifted. If the person&#8217;s breathing or heart stops,&nbsp;cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)&nbsp;should be performed.\nFurther treatment will be carried out in hospital.\nRead more about treating anaphylaxis.\nAnaphylaxis is the result of your body&#8217;s immune system overreacting to a harmless substance, such as food. Substances that trigger allergic reactions are known as allergens.\nAnaphylaxis usually develops within minutes of contact with an allergen, but sometimes the reaction can happen up to 4&nbsp;hours later.\nThe most widely reported triggers of anaphylaxis are:\n- insect stings&nbsp;– particularly wasp and bee stings\n- peanuts and tree nuts\n- other types of foods&nbsp;–&nbsp;such as milk and seafood\n- certain medicines&nbsp;–&nbsp;such as&nbsp;antibiotics\nRead more about the&nbsp;causes of anaphylaxis.\nIf you know what has triggered anaphylaxis, it&#8217;s important to take steps to avoid exposure to similar triggers.\nYou should be referred to a specialist allergy clinic to either find out your allergy triggers or, if you already know what causes it, for further assessment and advice about how to avoid allergens in the future.\nYou may be given two adrenaline auto-injectors to use during any future episodes of anaphylaxis.\nRead more about&nbsp;preventing anaphylaxis.\nAnaphylaxis is not common, but people of all ages can be affected. People with other allergic conditions, such as&nbsp;asthma or the allergic skin condition&nbsp;atopic eczema, are most at risk of developing anaphylaxis.\nAlthough the condition is life threatening, deaths are rare. There are around 20 deaths in the UK each year. With prompt and proper treatment, most people make a full recovery.&nbsp;\nAnaphylaxis is caused by a problem with the immune system, which is the body&#8217;s natural defence against illness and infection.\nIn the case of anaphylaxis, your immune system overreacts to a harmless substance and releases a number of different chemicals, such as histamine, to deal with the mistaken threat.\nSome of the more common triggers for anaphylaxis are shown below.\nMost cases of anaphylaxis are caused by wasp and bee stings, although potentially any insect bite or sting can cause anaphylaxis.\nIt&#8217;s estimated around&nbsp;1 in 100 people will experience an allergic reaction after a wasp or bee sting, but only a small number of these people will go on to develop severe anaphylaxis.\nMore than half of all cases of food-related anaphylaxis are caused by peanuts.\nOther foods known to trigger anaphylaxis include:\n- nuts&nbsp;– such as walnuts, cashew nuts, almonds, brazil nuts and hazelnuts\n- milk\n- fish and shellfish\n- eggs\n- some types of fruit&nbsp;– such as bananas, kiwi fruit, grapes and strawberries\nMedicines known to trigger anaphylaxis in a small amount of people include:\n- antibiotics&nbsp;– particularly penicillin-like antibiotics\n- general anaesthetic&nbsp;–&nbsp;muscle-relaxant medicines used during surgery&nbsp;\n- non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)&nbsp;– a type of painkiller that includes&nbsp;ibuprofen and&nbsp;aspirin\nPeople sensitive to these types of medicines will usually develop anaphylaxis as soon as they begin a course of treatment, although they may have safely received them in the past.\nThe risk of anaphylaxis using these types of medicines is very small, so in most cases the benefits of treatment outweigh the potential risk.\nFor example, the risk of developing anaphylaxis is around:\n- 1 in 1,480&nbsp;after taking a NSAID-type painkiller&nbsp;\n- 1 in 5,000 after taking penicillin\n- 1 in 10,000 after being given a general anaesthetic\nContrast agents are a group of special dyes used in some medical tests to help certain areas of your body show up better on scans such as&nbsp;X-rays.\nFor example, a contrast agent injected into a blood vessel will help show up any problems in the vessel, such as a blockage, on the X-ray. This is known as&nbsp;angiography.\nThe risk of developing anaphylaxis after being injected with a contrast agent is thought to be less than&nbsp;1 in 10,000.\nLess than 1 in 100 people in the population has a&nbsp;natural rubber latex allergy. Healthcare, hair, beauty, catering and motor industry workers are more likely to have a latex allergy.\nThose with a history of hayfever, asthma, eczema, and certain medical conditions, like spina bifida, are more likely to be affected.\nSometimes, despite extensive testing, no trigger can be found for anaphylaxis, and the cause remains unknown. This is known as idiopathic anaphylaxis.\nIf you think somebody is experiencing symptoms of anaphylaxis, you should use an adrenaline injector if one is available. Dial 999 immediately afterwards.\nCall 999 straight away if an adrenaline injector is not available.\nIf you can see a potential trigger, such as a wasp or bee sting stuck in their skin, carefully remove it.\nAdrenaline causes the blood vessels to become narrower, which raises your blood pressure and reduces swelling. It also causes the airways to open, relieving breathing difficulties.\nAn adrenaline injection should be given as soon as a serious reaction is suspected.\nThe signs of suspected anaphylaxis are:\n- problems breathing\n- feeling faint or dizzy\n- loss of consciousness\nThe injection&nbsp;can be done by the person with anaphylaxis, but sometimes&nbsp;– if it&#8217;s a young child or someone who is unconscious, for example&nbsp;– another person may need to do it.\nBefore attempting the injection, make sure you know what to do. You should read all of the instructions carefully when you, or the person you are responsible for, are first prescribed the injector.\nAfter injecting, the syringe should be held in place for 5 to 10 seconds. Injections can be given through clothing.\nAfter injecting the adrenaline, you should immediately dial 999 for an ambulance, even if the person is starting to feel better.\nMost people should experience a rapid improvement in symptoms once the adrenaline has been used.\nIf there&#8217;s no improvement after 5 to 10 minutes, you should inject a second dose of adrenaline, if one is available. This should be injected into the opposite thigh.\nRead Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) 2014&nbsp;guidelines on how to use an adrenaline auto-injector (PDF, 188kb).\nIn most cases, the person should lie flat, with their legs raised on a chair or a low table, to help maintain bloodflow to the head and heart.\nPregnant women should lie down on their left side to avoid putting too much pressure on the large vein that leads to the heart.\nIf the person is conscious but having trouble breathing, they should sit up to make breathing easier.\nIf the person is unconscious, check that&nbsp;their airways are open and clear, and also check their breathing. Then put them in the&nbsp;recovery position to make sure they don&#8217;t choke on their vomit.\nPlace the person on their side, making sure they are supported by one leg and one arm. Open the airway by tilting the head and lifting the chin.\nIf the person&#8217;s breathing or heart stops,&nbsp;cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should be performed.\nEven if adrenaline is given, the person will need to go to hospital for observation&nbsp;– usually for&nbsp;6 to 12 hours – as symptoms can occasionally return during this period.\nWhile in hospital, an oxygen mask can be used to help breathing, and fluids given by an intravenous drip directly into a vein can help increase blood pressure.\nAs well as adrenaline, additional medications such as&nbsp;antihistamines and corticosteroids&nbsp;can be used to help relieve symptoms. Blood tests&nbsp;may also be carried out while you&#8217;re in hospital to confirm anaphylaxis.\nYou should be able to leave hospital when the symptoms are under control and it&#8217;s thought they will not return quickly. This may be after a few hours, but you may have to stay in hospital for a few days if the symptoms were severe.\nYou may be asked to take antihistamines and corticosteroid tablets 2&nbsp;to 3&nbsp;days after leaving hospital to help stop your symptoms returning.\nYou will probably be asked to attend a follow-up appointment so you can be given advice about how you can avoid further episodes of anaphylaxis.\nAn adrenaline auto-injector may be given to you for emergency use between leaving hospital and attending the follow-up appointment.\nRead more about preventing anaphylaxis.\nIf you have anaphylaxis, you should be offered advice and medication to help prevent further episodes.\nYou should be referred to a specialist allergy clinic for tests to find out what caused the anaphylaxis. Knowing what allergen triggered the allergic reaction can help you avoid further episodes of anaphylaxis.\nSome of the tests commonly used to determine allergies include:\n- a skin prick test – your skin is pricked with a tiny amount of a suspected allergen to see if it reacts by becoming red, raised and itchy\n- a blood test – a sample of your blood is taken to test its reaction to a suspected allergen\nRead more about&nbsp;diagnosing allergies.\nYou may be prescribed an adrenaline auto-injector if you&#8217;ve had a previous episode of anaphylaxis and there&#8217;s a risk of you having another episode in the future.\nThere are 3&nbsp;types of auto-injector:\n- EpiPen\n- Jext&nbsp;\n- Emerade\nEach type is slightly different, and you should make sure you know how to use your auto-injector correctly.\nYou can also ask for a &#8220;trainer&#8221; kit so you can practise giving yourself or your child injections.\nThe following points are important:\n- Carry your auto-injector(s) at all times – there should be no exceptions. It may also be recommended that you get an emergency card or bracelet with full details of your allergy and doctor&#8217;s contact details to alert others.\n- Extremes of heat can make adrenaline less effective, so don&#8217;t leave your auto-injector in&nbsp;the fridge or your car&#8217;s glove compartment.\n- Check the expiry date regularly. An out-of-date injector will offer limited protection.\n- The manufacturers offer a reminder service, where you can be contacted near the expiry date. Check the information leaflet that comes with your medicine for more information.\n- If your child has an auto-injector, they will need to change over to an adult dose once they reach 30kg (approximately&nbsp;4.5 stone).\n- Don&#8217;t delay injecting yourself if you think you may be experiencing the beginning of anaphylaxis, even if your initial symptoms are mild. It&#8217;s better to use adrenaline early and then find out it was a false alarm than delay treatment until you&#8217;re sure you are experiencing severe anaphylaxis.\nIf a trigger has been identified as causing your episode of anaphylaxis, you will need to take steps to avoid it in the future.\nYou can reduce the chances of being exposed to a food allergen by:\n- checking food labels\n- letting staff at a restaurant know what you&#8217;re allergic to, so it&#8217;s not included in your meal\n- remembering that some types of food may contain small traces of potential allergens – for example, some sauces contain wheat and peanuts\nSee&nbsp;our page on living with a food allergy&nbsp;for more information.\nYou can reduce your risk of being stung by an insect by taking basic precautions, such as:\n- moving away from wasps, hornets or bees slowly without panicking – don&#8217;t wave your arms around or swat at them\n- using an insect repellent if you spend time outdoors, particularly in the summer\nSome specialist allergy centres also offer special treatment to help desensitise you to insect stings if you are at a particularly high risk of a further sting&nbsp;– for example, if you are&nbsp;a beekeeper or gardener.\nRead more about&nbsp;preventing insect stings.\nIf you&#8217;re allergic to certain types of medicines, there are normally alternatives that can be safely used. For example, if you&#8217;re allergic to:\n- penicillin – you can normally safely take a different group of antibiotics known as&nbsp;macrolides\n- non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and aspirin – you can normally safely take paracetamol, but read the ingredients of things like colds medicines carefully to make sure they don&#8217;t contain NSAIDs\n- one type of&nbsp;general anaesthetic – others are available, or it may be possible to perform surgery using a&nbsp;local anaesthetic or an&nbsp;epidural injection\n- angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors – alternative blood pressure medications, such as calcium channel blockers, can be used\nAlways tell any healthcare professional about medicine allergies you have, as they may not be aware of them.\nThere may be times when it&#8217;s necessary to use contrast agents – for example, if you had bleeding inside your brain – even if this places you at risk of anaphylaxis.\nIn such circumstances, you can be given injections of&nbsp;antihistamines and&nbsp;corticosteroids before the contrast agents, which may help prevent symptoms occurring or at least make them less severe."

        "disease": "Angina",
        "description": "Angina is chest pain which occurs when the blood supply to the heart becomes restricted because of narrowing or blockages in the blood vessels around the heart.\nThe main symptom of angina is chest pain. This can:\n- feel like a dull pain, ache, &#8216;heavy&#8217; or &#8216;tight&#8217; feeling in your chest\n- spread to your arms, neck, jaw or back\n- be triggered by physical exertion\nAngina itself is not life threatening, but prolonged chest pain can be a symptom of a heart attack.\nYou or someone else has symptoms like:\nIf your GP practice is closed, phone 111.\nTo diagnose angina, you will be assessed and you may need to have several tests.\nYou will also be asked some questions about:\n- the symptoms you experienced\n- if there were any triggers for the pain\n- your family&#8217;s medical history\n- lifestyle risk factors (like smoking, for example)\nYou might also be given some tests to determine if you already have heart disease or you&#8217;re at risk of it.\n- measuring your weight\n- measuring blood pressure\n- taking blood to check cholesterol levels, diabetes or anaemia\nIf it&#8217;s thought that you have angina, you might be referred to the hospital for some more tests. These might include:\n- electrocardiogram (ECG) – measures the rhythms and electrical activity of the heart\n- exercise tolerance test (ETT) – measures the activity of the heart during exercise\n- myocardial perfusion scan (MPS or MYoview) – measures how well blood is reaching the heart\n- coronary angiography – shows whether your coronary arteries are narrow and how severe any blockages are\n- blood tests&nbsp;– help to identify increased enzyme levels (troponin) which are released when the heart is damaged\nThe 2 main types of angina are stable angina and unstable angina.\nStable angina is more common. Attacks are more likely to have a trigger (like physical activity or stress).\nSymptoms of stable angina usually only last for a few minutes after exercise or stress. They can improve with rest and by taking a medication called Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN).\nAttacks of unstable angina can be unpredictable and develop without any clear triggers. They might also last longer and continue even when resting.\nSometimes, when chest pain occurs suddenly, it&#8217;s unclear if it&#8217;s due to unstable angina or a heart attack. Until tests confirm the diagnosis, doctors sometimes call this Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS).\nThere are various ways to treat and manage angina.\nIf you have stable angina you may be given medicine to:\n- prevent and treat angina attacks\n- reduce your risk of a heart attack\nYou may be given nitrates if you have stable angina. These work by relaxing the muscles in the blood vessels so that blood can pass through more easily.\nYou might be given nitrates as:\n- slow release tablets\n- a fast acting spray or tablet\nGlyceryl trinitrate (GTN) is usually given in a fast acting spray or tablets. You should keep this with you at all times. If you experience an episode of angina you can use the spray or tablet under your tongue. The pain should then ease within a few minutes.\nYou can repeat the dose after 5 minutes if the pain has not gone away. If the pain has still not gone 5 minutes after you take the second dose you should call an ambulance.\nBeta blockers work mainly by slowing down the heart.\nCalcium channel blockers relax the arteries, increasing blood supply to the heart muscle.\nIf you cannot have beta blockers or calcium channel blockers, you may be given another medicine. Your doctor will discuss this with you.\nTo reduce your risk of more serious cardiovascular problems, your doctor might give you:\n- a low dose of aspirin to prevent blood clots\n- statins to reduce your cholesterol (blood fats) level\n- ACE inhibitors to reduce your blood pressure\nWorsening angina symptoms over a short period of time can be a sign of a more acute coronary syndrome and you should seek urgent medical advice by phoning 999.\nIf you have unstable angina (where symptoms develop unpredictably), you&#8217;ll need certain medicines. These will prevent blood clots and reduce your risk of having a heart attack.\nYou may be given:\n- low-dose aspirin\n- clopidogrel\n- Ticagrelor\nSurgery may be recommended if you continue to have angina attacks despite medical treatment. It may also be recommended if tests show that you&#8217;re at a high risk of having a heart attack.\nThere are 2 types of procedures that are used to treat angina. These are a:\n- coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)\n- percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)\nThe best option for you depends on your circumstances. You should discuss the different options with your doctor. It&#8217;s likely that you will need to continue taking some medicines after surgery.\nA CABG is where a section of a blood vessel is taken from another part of the body. This is then used to re-route the flow of blood past a blocked or narrow section of artery.\nPCI is where a narrowed section of artery is widened using a balloon and a tiny tube called a stent. It&#8217;s also known as a coronary angioplasty."

        "disease": "Angioedema",
        "description": "Angioedema is the swelling of the deeper layers of the skin, caused by a build-up of fluid.\nThe symptoms of angioedema can affect any part of the body, but&nbsp;swelling usually&nbsp;affects the:\n- eyes\n- lips\n- genitals\n- hands\n- feet\nMany people with angioedema also experience urticaria (hives). This is a raised, red and itchy rash that appears on the skin.\nThe cause of angioedema depends on the type you have. There are 4&nbsp;main types of angioedema:\n- allergic angioedema –&nbsp;the swelling is caused by an allergic reaction, such as a reaction to peanuts, and sometimes occurs in combination with anaphylaxis\n- idiopathic angioedema –&nbsp;there is no known cause for the swelling (although certain factors, such as stress or infection, may trigger the symptoms)\n- drug-induced angioedema –&nbsp;the swelling is a side effect of certain medications,&nbsp;most often&nbsp;angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors\n- hereditary angioedema –&nbsp;the swelling is caused by &#8220;faulty&#8221; genes that are inherited from a person’s parents\nRead more about the causes of angioedema.\nAngioedema is a common condition, affecting about 10-20% of people during their life, although&nbsp;some types are more common than others.\nHereditary angioedema is rare, only affecting between 1 in 10,000&nbsp;and 1 in 50,000 people worldwide.\nYour doctor can&nbsp;diagnose angioedema by examining the affected skin and&nbsp;discussing symptoms.\nHowever, further tests, such as blood tests&nbsp;or allergy tests,&nbsp;may be required to determine the type of angioedema.\nIdiopathic angioedema is only diagnosed if no cause can be found.\nRead more about diagnosing angioedema.\nAlthough most cases of angioedema get better without treatment after a few days, medication is often used.\nFor cases of allergic and idiopathic angioedema, antihistamines and&nbsp;oral steroids (steroid tablets) can be used to relieve the swelling.\nDrug-induced angioedema can usually be treated by&nbsp;using an alternative medication to treat whatever underlying condition you have.\nAlthough the condition cannot be cured, regular drug treatment can prevent attacks in people with hereditary angioedema.\nRead more about treating angioedema.\nThe main sign of angioedema is swelling that develops below the skin&#8217;s surface.\nThe swelling is caused by a collection of fluid in the deep layers of the skin.\nIt most often affects the hands, feet, eyes, lips, or genitals. In severe cases, the inside lining of the throat and bowel can be affected (see below).\nThe swelling&nbsp;usually appears suddenly, and is more severe than normal hives (nettle rash). It commonly lasts 1&nbsp;to 3&nbsp;days. There may be a prickling sensation in the affected area before swelling is visible.\nThe swelling is not itchy and the skin may look a normal colour; however, many people with allergic or idiopathic angioedema also develop&nbsp;urticaria (hives), which is red and itchy.\nAs well as visible swellings, angioedema can cause other symptoms, including:\n- a hot or painful&nbsp;sensation in the swollen areas\n- swelling of the inside of the throat, the&nbsp;windpipe and the tongue, making breathing difficult\n- swelling of the conjunctiva (the transparent layer of cells that cover the white part of the eye), which affects&nbsp;vision\nPeople with hereditary angioedema may also experience:\n- abdominal (stomach) pain caused by swelling in the stomach and bowel, which can cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea\n- swelling of the bladder or urethra (the tube that connects the bladder to the genitals), which can cause bladder problems and difficulty passing urine\nContact your GP if you have an episode of angioedema that does not affect your breathing and you have not previously been diagnosed with the condition. You will need to have tests to determine what type of angioedema you have.\nDial 999 to request an ambulance if you suspect that you, or someone you know, is experiencing anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction). Tell the operator that you suspect anaphylaxis.\nInitial symptoms of anaphylaxis include:\n- a feeling of tightness in the chest that leads to&nbsp;breathing problems&nbsp;\n- swelling of the tongue and throat\nIf you, or the person in your care, has previously been prescribed an adrenaline auto-injector pen, you should use it while waiting for the ambulance to arrive.\nAngioedema is often caused by a problem with the immune system, although there are many cases where no cause can be identified.\nNormally, your immune system protects your body from illness and infection by attacking germs in your body.\nIn allergic angioedema, your immune system mistakenly attacks harmless substances in your blood. Your body produces the chemical histamine, which causes the blood vessels in the area to expand, leading to swelling of the skin.\nSubstances known to trigger allergic angioedema include:\n- certain types of food – particularly nuts, shellfish, milk and eggs\n- some types of medication&nbsp;–&nbsp;such as penicillin, aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen\n- insect bites and stings – particularly wasp and bee stings\n- latex – a naturally occurring rubber used to make medical gloves, balloons and condoms\nCases of angioedema without an identifiable cause are known as idiopathic angioedema. It may be that a problem with the immune system sometimes causes it to &#8220;misfire&#8221;.\nIn cases of&nbsp;idiopathic angioedema, certain triggers may lead to swelling, such as:\n- anxiety or stress\n- minor infections\n- hot or cold temperatures\n- exercise\nAvoiding these triggers whenever possible may improve your symptoms.\nSome medications can cause angioedema. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which are used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension), are usually responsible.\nIt&#8217;s estimated that around&nbsp;1-5% of&nbsp;people taking ACE inhibitors will develop drug-induced angioedema. Black people being treated with ACE inhibitors are 3&nbsp;to 4&nbsp;times more likely to develop this side effect than white people.\nAround 1&nbsp;in 4&nbsp;cases of drug-induced angioedema occurs during the first month of taking an ACE inhibitor. The remaining cases develop many months or even years after treatment begins.\nWhile they are useful in lowering blood pressure, ACE inhibitors can sometimes disrupt the &#8220;chemical balance&#8221; and trigger an episode of severe swelling.\nLess common causes of drug-induced angioedema include:\n- bupropion – a medication that helps people to give up smoking\n- vaccines\n- selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)&nbsp;– a type of antidepressant\n- COX-II inhibitors – a type of painkiller used to treat chronic pain conditions such as arthritis\n- NSAIDs – a type of painkiller, such as aspirin or ibuprofen\n- angiotensin-2 receptor antagonists –&nbsp;another medication used to treat high blood pressure\n- statins –&nbsp;used to treat people with high cholesterol levels\n- proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) –&nbsp;used to treat&nbsp;stomach ulcers\nHereditary angioedema is caused by a genetic mutation (a change in the DNA) in the C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-inh) gene. Genes are single units of genetic material that code for characteristics such as eye and hair colour.\nAs a result of the mutated C1-inh&nbsp;gene, the body does not make enough C1-inh&nbsp;protein. This protein plays an important role in regulating the immune system. Without enough C1-inh&nbsp;protein, the immune system can misfire and trigger the symptoms of angioedema.\nCertain&nbsp;things are thought to trigger hereditary angioedema, such as:\n- trauma&nbsp;–&nbsp;including surgery or infection\n- the oral contraceptive pill\n- pregnancy\nThe mutated C1-inh gene is passed down through families. If you have hereditary angioedema, you have a&nbsp;50% chance of passing it on to your children.\nAngioedema is usually diagnosed by your doctor examining the affected skin and discussing your symptoms.\nIt can be difficult to find the exact cause and identify which type of angioedema you have. There is no single test available, but you may have allergy tests or&nbsp;blood tests if a specific cause is suspected.\nYou&#8217;re likely to be asked if&nbsp;you have recently been exposed to any allergy-causing substances, such as nuts or latex.&nbsp;You may also be asked whether you have a history of other allergic conditions, such as&nbsp;urticaria (hives) or asthma. People with an allergic condition often develop other allergic conditions.\nTell your doctor about any medications you are taking, including over-the-counter medication, such as painkillers, herbal supplements and vitamins.\nYour GP may recommend that you keep a diary of your exposure to possible irritants – or a food diary, if a food allergy is suspected.\nIf allergic angioedema is suspected, you are&nbsp;likely to be referred to a specialist allergy or immunology clinic for further testing. Tests may include:\n- a skin prick test –&nbsp;your skin is pricked with a tiny amount of the suspected allergen to see whether there is a reaction\n- a&nbsp;blood test – a sample of your blood is tested to determine whether your immune system reacts to a suspected allergen\nRead more about&nbsp;diagnosing allergies.\nIf you are taking a medication known to cause drug-induced angioedema, your GP will withdraw that medication and prescribe an alternative. You should not stop taking any prescribed medication without advice from a health professional.\nIf you don&#8217;t have any further episodes of angioedema, a diagnosis of drug-induced angioedema can be made.\nHereditary angioedema can be diagnosed using a blood test to check the level of proteins regulated by the C1-inh gene. A very low level would suggest hereditary angioedema.\nThe diagnosis and management of hereditary angioedema is highly specialised and should be carried out in a specialist immunology clinic.\nIdiopathic angioedema is usually confirmed by a &#8220;diagnosis of exclusion&#8221;. This means a diagnosis of idiopathic angioedema can only be made after all the above tests have been carried out and a cause has not been found.&nbsp;\nAs angioedema can be associated with other medical problems – such as an iron deficiency, liver diseases and problems with the thyroid gland – your doctor or specialist will undertake some simple blood tests to check for these conditions.\nMedication is the main treatment for angioedema, although many cases get better after a few days without treatment.\nAllergic angioedema and idiopathic angioedema are usually treated in the same way, using a combination of antihistamines and&nbsp;corticosteroids to help relieve the swelling.\nDrug-induced angioedema can usually be treated by using an alternative medication to the one causing your symptoms.\nIf you also had symptoms of anaphylaxis during an episode of angioedema, you will probably be given an adrenaline auto-injector pen in case your symptoms return.&nbsp;\nRead more about&nbsp;treating anaphylaxis.\nHereditary angioedema cannot be cured and does not respond to adrenaline, antihistamines or steroids, so a preventative approach is taken.&nbsp;A number of different medications are used to stabilise the protein levels in your blood to help prevent symptoms developing.\nAntihistamines work by blocking the effects of a protein called histamine, which is one of the chemicals responsible for causing your skin to swell.\nA 2-week course of&nbsp;a non-sedating type of antihistamine (which does not cause drowsiness) is usually recommended – these include fexofenadine and cetirizine. Cetirizine can be bought over the counter in pharmacies and supermarkets without a prescription.\nAntihistamines can also be given by injection at hospital or your GP surgery.\nIf you also have&nbsp;urticaria (hives)&nbsp;and are being kept awake at night by itchy skin, your GP may prescribe an older type of antihistamine&nbsp;to take before going to bed. These types&nbsp;cause drowsiness and should help you sleep.\nA minority of people will still experience drowsiness after taking the newer type of antihistamines. If you find yourself feeling drowsy, you should avoid:\n- driving\n- drinking alcohol\n- operating complex or heavy machinery\nOther side effects of the newer antihistamines include:\n- headache\n- dry mouth\n- dry nose\nThese side effects are usually short-lived and should pass quickly.\nCorticosteroids (steroids) work by blocking many of your immune system&#8217;s actions. In most cases, a 3&nbsp;to 5&nbsp;day course of steroid tablets is recommended. A steroid called prednisolone is the preferred choice.\nSide effects of prednisolone include:\n- nausea\n- abdominal (stomach) pain\n- tiredness\n- oral thrush&nbsp;–&nbsp;a fungal infection inside your mouth\n- dizziness\nIf you feel dizzy after taking prednisolone, avoid driving and operating heavy machinery. These side effects should pass once you finish the course of treatment.\nSteroid injections may be needed for more severe cases of angioedema. These are usually administered in hospitals or at specialist clinics&nbsp;by an allergy specialist or immunologist (a doctor who specialises in treating conditions that affect the immune system).\nThe medication used to treat hereditary angioedema falls into 1&nbsp;of 2&nbsp;categories:\n- medication used to prevent angioedema\n- medication used to relieve symptoms\nDanazol is a synthetic hormone that is effective in preventing the symptoms of angioedema because it helps boost levels of the C1-inh protein.\nHowever, danazol can cause a number of unpleasant side effects if used on a long-term basis. For example, it may cause:\n- weight gain\n- depression \n- disruption to the menstrual cycle&nbsp;–&nbsp;such as&nbsp;irregular periods or&nbsp;absent periods\n- high blood pressure\n- in women, changes to the body that are usually associated with men&nbsp;–&nbsp;such as excessive&nbsp;body hair growth, flattening of the chest, deepening of the voice and an increase in muscle tone\n- liver problems\nDue to&nbsp;these side effects, many people with hereditary angioedema are uneasy about using danazol on a long-term basis. Stanozolol is a similar medication that is slightly better tolerated.\nTranexamic acid is also an alternative medication to danazol. It can be as effective as danazol, but does not cause as many side effects and is preferred for use in women.\nIcatibant is a relatively new medication used to treat acute (short-lasting) episodes of swelling. It works by blocking the effects of some of the chemicals that are responsible for causing the swelling in cases of hereditary angioedema.\nIcatibant is given by injection under the skin, and a&nbsp;second injection is often required.\nCommon side effects of icatibant include:\n- adverse skin reactions at the site of the injection&nbsp;–&nbsp;such as pain, redness, swelling or itchiness\n- itchiness in other areas of the skin&nbsp;&nbsp;\n- dizziness\nPurified C1-inhibitor concentrate is widely used to replace the missing protein in the blood. It&#8217;s needed for patients undergoing surgery, to prevent attacks caused by surgical trauma. It&#8217;s used to treat acute attacks and is injected directly into the vein.\nMany patients will keep supplies of their concentrate at home for emergency use.\nIcatibant and C1-inhibitor concentrate will be prescribed by the specialist immunology unit caring for the patient with hereditary angioedema."

        "disease": "Ankylosing spondylitis",
        "description": "Ankylosing spondylitis is a long-term (chronic) condition. The spine, or other areas of the body, become inflamed causing part of the spine to join up (fuse) and lose flexibility (ankylosis).\nAnkylosing spondylitis usually starts to develop in teenagers or young adults. Though most symptoms and diagnoses happen in people&#8217;s 20s.\nIt&#8217;s not known exactly what causes ankylosing spondylitis.\nStudies have shown there&#8217;s a link between it and a gene known as HLA-B27. Having this gene does not necessarily mean you will develop ankylosing spondylitis.\nIt&#8217;s estimated that 8% of people carry the HLA-B27 gene, but most do not have ankylosing spondylitis.\nThe symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis can vary from person to person. They can develop slowly over several months or years.\nThe main symptoms include:\n- arthritis – causing pain, tenderness and swelling in the joints\n- enthesitis – painful inflammation where a bone is joined to a tendon or ligament, commonly in the heel, ribs or elbow\n- pain and swelling in other parts of the body – like the hips, knees and ribs\n- fatigue &#8211; severe tiredness that doesn&#8217;t improve with sleep or rest\n- pain in your lower back in the early morning\n- morning stiffness that lasts at least 30 minutes and then eases through the day or with activity\n- pain that doesn&#8217;t improve or gets worse with rest\n- waking up regularly during the night because of the pain\n- pain in the area around your buttocks\nAnkylosing spondylitis can be difficult to diagnose. This is because it develops slowly. This can lead to a delay in diagnosis as back pain is fairly common in the community. There can be a delay in presentation and subsequent referral to specialist (Rheumatologist).\nYou should speak to your GP if you have symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis. They will usually ask:\n- what symptoms you&#8217;re experiencing\n- when the symptoms started\n- how long you&#8217;ve had symptoms for\nYour GP may also arrange blood tests to check for signs of inflammation and x-rays of your lower back and pelvis.\nA Rheumatologist is a specialist in conditions that affect the muscles and joints.\nThe Rheumatologist may carry out other tests which can include:\n- an x-ray\n- a MRI scan\n- an ultrasound scan\n- genetic testing\nThere is no cure for ankylosing spondylitis. But, treatment is available to help relieve the symptoms.\nTreatment can also help delay or prevent the spine from fusing (joining up) and stiffening.\nIn most cases, treatment will involve a mix of:\n- exercise\n- physiotherapy\n- medication\nMost people with ankylosing spondylitis will not need surgery. But, if the joint becomes very damaged, joint replacement surgery may be recommended. This can help to improve pain and movement in the joint.\nKeeping active can improve your posture and range of spinal movement. It can also prevent your spine from becoming stiff and painful.\nFurther information on exercise for ankylosing spondylitis\nPhysiotherapy is a key part of treating ankylosing spondylitis. A Physiotherapist can explain the best exercises for you. They can also draw up an exercise programme that suits you.\nTypes of physiotherapy for ankylosing spondylitis include:\n- a group exercise programme\n- an individual exercise programme\n- massage\n- hydrotherapy (exercise in warm swimming pool)\nWith hydrotherapy the buoyancy of the water helps make movement easier by supporting you. The warmth can also help relax your muscles.\nSome people prefer to swim or play sport to keep flexible. This is usually fine, although some daily stretching and exercise is also important.\nSpeak to your Physiotherapist or Rheumatologist if you&#8217;re worried about taking up a new type of sport or exercise.\nThe National Ankylosing Spondylitis Society (NASS) has information about different types of exercise to help you manage your condition.\nYou may need painkillers to manage ankylosing spondylitis. But, not everyone needs them all the time. Types of painkillers you may be prescribed include:\n- non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)\n- paracetamol\nSome people may be given a type of medication called Biologics. These are used if painkillers and exercise don&#8217;t help.\nExamples of Biologics used are:\n- Anti TNF medication (Adalimumab, Etanercept, Golimumab)\n- Monoclonal Antibody Treatment (Secukinumab, Ixekizumab)\n- JAK Inhibitors (Baricitinib, Updacitinib)\nAll these medications work by reducing inflammation.\nCorticosteroids have a powerful anti-inflammatory effect. They can be taken as tablets or injections.\nIf a particular joint is inflamed, corticosteroids can be injected directly into the joint. After the injection, you will need to rest the joint for up to 48 hours.\nDMARDs may be prescribed in ankylosing spondyliits if there is pain and inflammation in peripheral joints such as the hands, knees, feet. They don&#8217;t work on the spine.\nWhile there is no cure for ankylosing spondylitis, most people are able to live a relatively normal life with minimal changes to their daily activities.\nOver time, ankylosing spondylitis can affect your ability to work. Most people can remain at work with some changes. These will help with posture when you are standing or sitting for long periods. They&#8217;ll also help with fatigue.\nThis could mean adjusting your work station or ensuring you take regular breaks. You should discuss this with your employer.\nAnkylosing spondylitis can affect many parts of the body. It can cause complications in your day-to-day life and may lead to other health conditions.\nSome complications associated with ankylosing spondylitis include:\n- less flexibility in the spine\n- joint damage – leading to pain and stiffness\n- osteoporosis\n- spinal fractures\n- iritis &#8211; painful eyes, swelling, sensitivity to light\n- blurry or cloudy vision, redness in part of the eye\n- cauda equina syndrome\nIf you have ankylosing spondylitis, you may also have a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD)."

        "description": "Anxiety is a feeling of unease, like worry or fear, that can be mild or severe.\nGAD is a long-term condition. It causes you to feel anxious about a wide range of issues, rather than 1 specific event.\nPeople with GAD feel anxious most days. They often struggle to remember the last time they felt relaxed.\nAs soon as 1 anxious thought is resolved, another may appear about a different issue.\nYour GP will ask you about your symptoms and your worries, fears and emotions.\nEveryone has feelings of anxiety at some point in their life. For example, you may feel worried and anxious about sitting an exam, or having a job interview.\nDuring times like these, feeling anxious can be perfectly normal.\nBut some people find it hard to control their worries. Their feelings of anxiety are more constant and often affect their daily lives.\nAnxiety is the main symptom of several conditions, including:\n- panic disorder\n- phobias\n- post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\n- social anxiety disorder (social phobia)\nThe information on this page is about a specific condition called generalised anxiety disorder (GAD).\nGAD can cause a change in your behaviour and the way you think and feel about things. It can also cause physical changes. This results in symptoms like:\n- restlessness\n- a sense of dread\n- feeling constantly &#8220;on edge&#8221;\n- difficulty concentrating\n- irritability\n- dizziness\n- tiredness\n- a noticeably strong, fast or irregular heartbeat (palpitations)\n- muscle aches and tension\n- trembling or shaking\n- dry mouth\n- excessive sweating\n- shortness of breath\n- stomach ache\n- feeling sick\n- headache\n- pins and needles\n- difficulty falling or staying asleep (insomnia)\nYour symptoms may cause you to withdraw from social contact to avoid feelings of worry and dread.\nYou may also find going to work difficult and stressful and may take time off sick. These actions can make you worry even more about yourself and increase your lack of self-esteem.\nIf you&#8217;re anxious as a result of a specific phobia or because of panic disorder, you&#8217;ll usually know what the cause is. For example, if you have claustrophobia (a fear of enclosed spaces), you know that being confined in a small space will trigger your anxiety.\nHowever, if you have GAD, it may not always be clear what you&#8217;re feeling anxious about. Not knowing what triggers your anxiety can intensify it. You may start to worry that there&#8217;ll be no solution.\nThe exact cause of GAD is not fully understood. It&#8217;s likely that a combination of several factors plays a role, like:\n- overactivity in areas of the brain involved in emotions and behaviour\n- an imbalance of the brain chemicals serotonin and noradrenaline, which are involved in the control and regulation of mood\n- the genes you inherit from your parents – you&#8217;re estimated to be 5 times more likely to develop GAD if a close relative has it\n- having a history of stressful or traumatic experiences, like domestic violence, child abuse or bullying\n- having a painful long-term health condition, like arthritis\n- having a history of drug or alcohol misuse\nHowever, many people develop GAD for no apparent reason.\nGAD can have a significant effect on your daily life. There are several different treatments are available that can help. These include:\n- talking therapies – like cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)\n- medication – like a type of antidepressant called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)\nThere are also many things you can do yourself to help reduce your anxiety, like:\n- trying a self-help course\n- exercising regularly\n- stopping smoking\n- cutting down on alcohol\n- drinking less caffeine\nWith treatment, many people are able to control their levels of anxiety. However, some treatments may need to be continued for a long time. There may be periods where your symptoms worsen.\nOur mental health self-help guides are based on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). They&#8217;ve proven highly successful in helping people with anxiety and other mental health issues.\nTry the anxiety self help guide\nDaylight is a digital programme to improve anxiety based on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT).

Many support groups also provide support and guidance over the phone or in writing.\nAsk your GP about local support groups for anxiety in your area. Or search our support service directory for mental health information and support services near you.\nIf treatments you&#8217;ve tried aren&#8217;t helping, you may want to discuss with your GP whether you should be referred to a mental health specialist.\nYou&#8217;ll usually be referred to your community mental health team. These teams include a range of specialists, including:\n- psychiatrists\n- psychiatric nurses\n- clinical psychologists\n- occupational therapists\n- social workers\nA mental health specialist from your local team will carry out a reassessment of your condition. They&#8217;ll ask you about your previous treatment and how effective you found it.\nYour specialist will then be able to devise a treatment plan for you.\nAs part of this plan, you may be offered a treatment you&#8217;ve not tried before.

It’s an understandable reaction in children to change or a stressful event.\nBut for some children, anxiety affects their behaviour and thoughts on a daily basis. This can interfere with their school, home and social life. If your child is anxious for a period of time and it&#8217;s impacting on day to day life you may need to speak to a healthcare professional to help support your child. For example, if they feel they cannot go to school or see their friends anymore.\nSo how do you know when your child’s anxiety has reached this stage?\nAnxiety can make a child feel scared, panicky, embarrassed or ashamed.\nSome of the signs to look out for in your child are:\n- finding it hard to concentrate\n- not sleeping, or waking in the night\n- not eating properly\n- quickly getting angry or irritable, and being out of control during outbursts\n- constantly worrying or having negative thoughts\n- feeling tense and fidgety, or using the toilet often\n- always crying\n- being clingy all the time (when other children are ok)\n- complaining of tummy aches and feeling unwell\n- being withdrawn and not wanting to do things they used to enjoy\nYour child may not be old enough to recognise why they’re feeling this way.\nThe reason for the anxiety (if there is one) will differ depending on the age of the child. Separation anxiety is common in younger children. Older children and teenagers tend to worry more about school performance, relationships or health.\nThe common types of anxiety in children and teenagers are :\nYoung children are commonly afraid of things like the dark or imaginary things like monsters. This is a normal part of growing up, but has the potential to become a phobia (a type of anxiety disorder) when the fear becomes overwhelming and affects your child’s day-to-day life.\nRead about phobias\nIt’s normal for children to frequently have fears and worries. Some anxious children may develop a condition called generalised anxiety disorder when they get older.\nGeneralised anxiety disorder causes you to feel anxious about a wide range of situations and issues, rather than one specific event. It&#8217;s a feeling of constant fear or dread all the time that makes doing daily tasks hard because of feelings of anxiety.\nPeople affected by it feel anxious most days and often struggle to remember the last time they felt relaxed.\nSeparation anxiety means a child worrying about not being with their parent or regular carer.\nIt’s common in young children, and normally develops at about 6 months of age. It can make settling into nursery or school or with a child minder very difficult.\nSeparation anxiety in older children may be a sign that they’re feeling insecure about something. They could be reacting to changes at home or at school, for example.\nSocial anxiety is not wanting to go out in public, see friends or take part in activities.\nSocial ‘shyness’ is perfectly normal for some children and teenagers. However it becomes a problem – ‘social anxiety disorder’ – when everyday activities like shopping or speaking on the phone cause intense, overwhelming fear. Children affected by it tend to fear doing or saying something they think will be humiliating.\nSocial anxiety disorder tends to affect older children who&#8217;ve gone through puberty.\nSome children become anxious about going to school. This could also be about schoolwork, friendships or bullying, especially if they’re changing school or moving up a level.\nThey may not always share these worries with you, and instead they may say they have a tummy ache or are feeling sick. One of the signs is crying or seeming tired in the morning.\nThis may be a problem that needs tackling if it is significantly affecting their daily life.\nPost-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder are other anxiety disorders that can occasionally affect children, but are usually seen in adults.\nYou should seek help for your child’s anxiety if:\n- you feel it’s not getting better or is getting worse, and efforts to tackle it yourself have not worked\n- you think it’s slowing down their development or having a significant effect on their schooling or relationships\n- it happens very frequently or they feel anxious all the time\n- it&#8217;s making them feel physically unwell a lot of the time like feeling sick or having constant headaches\n- your child becomes very withdrawn and is anxious about doing things they used to enjoy\nLong-term anxiety can severely interfere with a child’s personal development, family life and schooling.\nAnxiety disorders that start in childhood often persist into the teenage years and early adulthood.\nTeenagers with an anxiety disorder can also:\n- experience clinical depression\n- feel hopeless\n- misuse drugs\nIf a child is experiencing anxiety, there’s plenty parents and carers can do to help. First, it’s important to listen to your child about their anxiety or worries.\nYoungMinds has advice and resources for parents.\nYoungScot has advice and support for young people.\nYou can talk to your GP or someone at your child&#8217;s school like the school nurse. You might want to do this on your own or with your child, or your child might be able to have an appointment without you. The healthcare professional should listen to your concerns and offer some advice about what to do next.\nYour child may be referred to the local child and adolescent mental health service (CAMHS). CAMHS staff are trained to help young people with a wide range of problems. Professionals who work in CAMHS services include:\n- psychologists\n- psychiatrists\n- nurses\n- occupational therapists\n- physiotherapists\n- and other specially trained professionals\nThey should offer help and support to parents and carers as well as the child.\nMore about CAMHS\nIf your child doesn’t want to see a doctor, they may be able to get help from a local youth counselling service.\nYouth counselling services are specially set up for young people to talk about what’s worrying them, and get advice.\nFor more information, search Scotland’s Service Directory for mental health and wellbeing services in your area. Counselling may also be available in your local school.\nTelephone helplines or online services can be helpful for children and young people. They might feel it’s easier to talk to someone who doesn’t know them.\nYoungScot has information about support organisations.\nYoungMinds has information about where to get support.\nThe type of treatment offered will depend on what is causing your child’s anxiety.\nIt can be helpful for your child to talk in confidence about what&#8217;s worrying them to a trained person, especially as it’s someone they don’t know.\nIf your child is being seen at CAMHS, they might see a child and adolescent psychotherapist or a clinical psychologist. If they&#8217;re at a youth counselling service, it might be a trained youth counsellor or psychotherapist.\nThese sessions can help them work out what is making them anxious and how they can work through the situation.\nPsychological therapies can really help with anxiety. They&#8217;re evidence based talking treatments, like cognitive behavioural therapy, that are proven to help.\nCognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a talking therapy that can help your child manage their problems by changing the way they think and behave.\nIt&#8217;s been proven to help with anxiety and is commonly offered to young people who are anxious.\nYour child will work with the psychological therapist to find ways to change the way they think. They&#8217;ll help your child to find strategies for coping in situations that make them anxious. The psychological therapies matrix describes the most helpful talking therapies for anxiety.\nWhat is psychological therapy?\nIf your child’s anxiety problem has not got better, your doctor may talk to you about trying medication.\nA type of antidepressant, called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), may help your child feel calmer and differently about things.\nAntidepressants usually take around 2 to 4 weeks to work properly, so you or your child may not notice the difference immediately.\nIt’s natural to be concerned about side effects. Your child should be aware of any possible adverse effects and should tell you or their doctor if they happen.\nSome children are simply born more nervous and anxious and less able to cope with stress than other children.\nSometimes traumatic life events like an illness, or an accident, can cause anxiety. This can happen even if your child was previously confident by nature before.\nA child’s anxious personality may be partly determined by the genes they’ve inherited from their parents. Parents of anxious children may recognise the signs and remember feeling and behaving the same when they were younger.\nSome children can also develop anxiety after a series of difficult life events. They may be able to cope with one of these events, but several difficult events together, or a traumatic single event, may be too much for them to cope with. Examples are:\n- frequently moving house and school – it can be hard to settle when you’re always expecting change\n- divorce or separation of parents\n- death of a close relative or friend\n- becoming seriously ill or injured in an accident\n- having someone in the family who is ill or disabled\n- school-related issues like homework or exams, or bullying or friendship problems\n- becoming involved in crime\n- being abused or neglected\nChildren with certain conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autistic spectrum disorders may experience anxiety as part of the symptoms of their condition. This is because of differences in the way their brain functions."

        "disease": "Appendicitis",
        "description": "Appendicitis is a painful swelling of the appendix. The appendix is a small, thin pouch about 5 to 10cm (2 to 4 inches) long. It&#8217;s connected to the large intestine, where stools (faeces) are formed.\nNobody knows exactly why we have an appendix, but removing it isn&#8217;t harmful.\nAppendicitis typically starts with a pain in the middle of your tummy (abdomen) that may come and go.\nWithin hours, the pain travels to the lower right-hand side, where the appendix usually lies, and becomes constant and severe.\nPressing on this area, coughing, or walking may all make the pain worse. You may lose your appetite, feel sick, and occasionally experience diarrhoea.\nRead more about the symptoms of appendicitis.\nIf you&#8217;re experiencing abdominal pain that&#8217;s gradually getting worse, contact your GP or local&nbsp;out-of-hours service immediately. If these options aren&#8217;t available, phone NHS 24&#8217;s 111 service for advice.\nYou should phone 999 for an ambulance if you have sudden pain that continues to get worse and spreads across your abdomen.\nThese are signs your appendix may have burst, which can lead to potentially life-threatening complications.\nRead more about:&nbsp;\n- diagnosing appendicitis&nbsp;\n- complications of appendicitis\nIn most cases of appendicitis, the appendix needs to be surgically removed as soon as possible.\nRemoval of the appendix, known as an appendectomy or appendicectomy, is one of the most common operations in the UK and its success rate is excellent.\nThe operation is most commonly performed as keyhole surgery (laparoscopy), which involves making several small cuts in your abdomen, through which special surgical instruments are inserted.\nOpen surgery, where a larger, single cut is made in the abdomen, is usually carried out if the appendix has burst or access is more difficult.\nMost people make a full recovery from an appendectomy in a couple of weeks, although strenuous activities may need to be avoided for up to 6&nbsp;weeks after open surgery.&nbsp;\nRead more&nbsp;about treating appendicitis.\nIt&#8217;s not exactly clear what the causes of appendicitis are. Most cases are thought to occur when something&nbsp;blocks the entrance of the appendix.\nFor example, a blockage may be formed by a small piece of&nbsp;faeces or an upper&nbsp;respiratory tract infection&nbsp;could lead to&nbsp;a swollen lymph node within the wall of the bowel.\nThis obstruction leads to the development of inflammation and swelling. The pressure caused by the swelling can then lead to the appendix bursting.\nAs the causes aren&#8217;t fully understood, there&#8217;s no guaranteed way of preventing appendicitis.\nAppendicitis is a common condition. It&#8217;s estimated around&nbsp;1 in every 13 people develop it at some point in their life.\nAppendicitis can develop at any age, but it&#8217;s most common in young people aged from 10 to 20 years old.\nAppendicitis typically starts with a pain in the middle of your tummy (abdomen) that may come and go.\nWithin hours, the pain travels to your lower right-hand side, where the appendix is usually located, and becomes constant and severe.\nPressing on this area, coughing, or walking may all make the pain worse.\nIf you have appendicitis, you may also have other symptoms, including:\n- feeling sick (nausea)\n- being sick\n- loss of appetite\n- diarrhoea\n- a high temperature (fever) and a flushed face\nIf you&#8217;re experiencing&nbsp;abdominal pain that&#8217;s gradually getting worse, contact your GP or local&nbsp;out-of-hours service immediately. If these options aren&#8217;t available, phone NHS 24 111 Service for advice.\nAppendicitis can easily be confused with something else, such as:\n- gastroenteritis\n- severe&nbsp;irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\n- constipation\n- bladder or&nbsp;urine infections\n- Crohn&#8217;s disease\n- pelvic infection\nIn young women, these symptoms can sometimes have a gynaecological cause, such as an ectopic pregnancy or menstrual pain.\nHowever, any condition that causes constant stomach pain requires urgent medical attention.\nYou should phone 999 for an ambulance if you get a pain that suddenly becomes worse and spreads across your abdomen. These are signs your appendix may have burst.\nIf the appendix bursts, it can cause&nbsp;peritonitis, a potentially serious infection of the inner lining of the abdomen.\nRead more about the complications of appendicitis.\nAppendicitis can be tricky to diagnose unless you have the typical symptoms, which are only present in about half of all cases.\nAlso, some people&#8217;s appendixes may be located in a slightly different part of their body, such as:\n- the pelvis\n- behind the large intestine\n- around the small bowel\n- near the right lower part of the liver\nSome people develop pain similar to appendicitis, but it&#8217;s caused by something else, such as:\n- gastroenteritis\n- severe&nbsp;irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\n- constipation\n- a bladder or&nbsp;urine infection\nYour GP will ask about your symptoms, examine your abdomen, and see if the pain gets worse when pressure is applied to the appendix area (your lower right-hand side).\nIf your symptoms are typical of appendicitis, this is normally enough for your GP to make a confident diagnosis. In&nbsp;this case, you&#8217;ll immediately be referred to hospital for treatment.\nIf your symptoms aren&#8217;t typical, further tests may be required in hospital to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.\nFurther tests may involve:&nbsp;\n- a&nbsp;blood test to look for signs of infection\n- a pregnancy test&nbsp;for women\n- a urine test to rule out other conditions, such as a bladder infection\n- an ultrasound scan&nbsp;to see if the appendix is swollen\n- a&nbsp;computerised tomography (CT) scan\nIt can sometimes take&nbsp;time to get test results. Your surgeon may recommend a laparoscopy to inspect your appendix and pelvic organs if the diagnosis is still uncertain.\nYou&#8217;ll usually&nbsp;be advised to have your appendix removed if appendicitis is suspected, rather than run the risk of it bursting. This means some people will have their appendix removed even though it&#8217;s eventually found to be normal.\nIn some cases where a diagnosis is not certain, a doctor may recommend waiting up to 24 hours to see if your symptoms improve, stay the same, or get worse.\nIf your doctor suspects your appendix has burst, you&#8217;ll be sent to hospital immediately for treatment.\nRead more about&nbsp;treating appendicitis.\nIf you have appendicitis, your appendix usually needs to be removed as soon as possible. This operation is known as an appendectomy or appendicectomy.\nSurgery is usually&nbsp;also recommended if there&#8217;s a chance you have appendicitis but it&#8217;s not been possible to make a clear diagnosis.\nThis is because it&#8217;s considered safer to remove the appendix than run the risk of the appendix bursting.\nIn humans, the appendix doesn&#8217;t perform any important function and having it removed doesn&#8217;t cause any long-term problems.\nAppendectomies are carried out under general anaesthetic using either a keyhole or open technique.\nKeyhole surgery (laparoscopy) is usually the preferred method of removing the appendix because the recovery tends to be quicker than with open surgery.\nThis operation involves making 3&nbsp;or 4&nbsp;small cuts (incisions) in your tummy (abdomen). Special instruments are then inserted, including:\n- a tube that gas is pumped through&nbsp;to inflate your abdomen – this allows the surgeon to see your appendix more clearly and gives them more room to work\n- a laparoscope&nbsp;– a small tube containing a light source and a camera, which relays images of the inside of the abdomen to a television monitor\n- small surgical tools used to remove the appendix\nOnce the appendix has been removed, the incisions will usually be closed with dissolvable&nbsp;stitches.&nbsp;Regular stitches&nbsp;may also be used, which need to be removed at your GP surgery 7 to 10 days later.\nIn some circumstances, keyhole surgery isn&#8217;t recommended and open surgery is performed instead. These include:\n- when the appendix has already burst and formed a lump called an appendix mass\n- when the surgeon isn&#8217;t very experienced in laparoscopic removal\n- people who have previously had open abdominal surgery\nIn these cases, the operation involves making a single larger cut in the lower right-hand side of your abdomen to remove the appendix.\nWhen there&#8217;s widespread peritonitis&nbsp;–&nbsp;infection of the inner lining of the abdomen&nbsp;–&nbsp;it&#8217;s sometimes necessary to operate through a long cut along the middle of the abdomen in a procedure called a laparotomy.\nAs with keyhole surgery, the incision&nbsp;is closed using either dissolvable stitches or regular stitches&nbsp;that need to be removed at a later date.&nbsp;\nAfter both types of surgery, the removed appendix is routinely sent to a laboratory to check there are no signs of cancer. This is a precautionary measure, although it&#8217;s rare for a serious problem to be found.\nOne of the main advantages of keyhole surgery is the recovery time tends to be short and most people can leave hospital a few days after the operation.\nIf the appendix is operated upon promptly, most patients can go home within 24 hours. With open or complicated surgery&nbsp;– for example, if you have peritonitis&nbsp;– it may&nbsp;take up to&nbsp;a week before you&#8217;re well enough to go home.\nFor the first few days after the operation you&#8217;re likely to experience some pain and bruising. This improves over time, but you can take painkillers if necessary.\nIf you had keyhole surgery, you may experience pain in the tip of your shoulder for about a week. This is caused by the gas that was pumped into the abdomen during the operation.\nYou may also experience some short-term constipation. You can help reduce this by not taking codeine painkillers, eating plenty of fibre, and&nbsp;staying well hydrated. Your GP can prescribe medication if the problem is particularly troublesome.\nBefore leaving hospital, you&#8217;ll be advised about caring for your wound and what activities you should avoid.\nIn most cases, you can return to normal activities in a couple of weeks, although more strenuous activities may need to be avoided for 4&nbsp;to 6&nbsp;weeks after open surgery.\nWhile you recover, it&#8217;s important to keep an eye out for signs of any problems.\nContact the hospital unit where the appendectomy was performed or your GP for advice if you notice:\n- increasing pain and swelling\n- you start vomiting repeatedly\n- a high temperature (fever)\n- any discharge coming from the wound\n- the wound is hot to touch\nThese symptoms could be a sign of infection.\nAppendectomies are one of the most commonly performed operations in the UK, and serious or long-term complications are rare.\nHowever, like all types of surgery, there are some risks. These include:\n- antibiotics may be given before, during, or after the operation to minimise the risk of serious infections\n- bleeding under the skin that causes a firm swelling (haematoma) – this usually gets better on its own, but you should see your GP if you&#8217;re concerned\n- scarring – both surgical techniques will leave some scarring where the incisions were made\n- a collection of pus (abscess) – in rare cases, an infection caused by the appendix bursting can lead to an abscess after surgery\n- hernia – at the site of the open incision or any of the incisions used in the laparoscopic approach\nThe use of general anaesthetic also carries some risks, such as the risk of an allergic reaction or inhaling stomach contents, leading to pneumonia. However, serious complications like this are very rare.\nIn some cases, appendicitis can lead to the development of a lump on the appendix called an appendix mass.\nThis lump, consisting of appendix and fatty tissue, is an attempt by the body to deal with the problem and heal itself.\nIf an appendix mass is found during an examination, your doctors may decide it&#8217;s not necessary to operate immediately.\nInstead, you&#8217;ll be given a course of antibiotics and an appointment will be made for an appendectomy a few weeks later, when the mass has settled.\nAnother possible alternative to immediate surgery is the use of antibiotics to treat appendicitis.\nHowever, studies have looked into whether antibiotics could be an alternative to surgery and as yet there isn&#8217;t enough clear evidence to suggest this is the case.\nIf appendicitis isn&#8217;t treated, the appendix can burst and cause potentially life-threatening infections.\nPhone 999 for an ambulance if you have abdominal (tummy) pain that suddenly gets much worse and spreads across your abdomen. These are signs your appendix may have burst.\nIf your appendix bursts, it releases bacteria into other parts of the body. This can cause a condition called peritonitis if the infection spreads to the peritoneum, the thin layer of tissue that lines the inside of the abdomen.\nSymptoms of peritonitis can include:\n- severe continuous abdominal pain\n- feeling sick or being sick\n- a high temperature (fever)\n- a rapid heartbeat\n- shortness of breath&nbsp;with rapid breathing\n- swelling of the abdomen\nIf peritonitis isn&#8217;t treated immediately, it can cause long-term problems and may even be fatal. Treatment for peritonitis usually involves antibiotics and the surgical removal of the appendix (appendectomy).\nSometimes an&nbsp;abscess forms around a burst appendix. This is a painful collection of pus that occurs as a result of the body&#8217;s attempt to fight the infection.&nbsp;\nIt can also occur as a complication of surgery to remove the appendix in about 1 in 500 cases.\nAbscesses can sometimes be treated using antibiotics, but in the vast majority of cases the pus needs to be drained from the abscess.\nThis can be carried out under ultrasound or computerised tomography (CT) guidance using local anaesthetic and a needle inserted through the skin, followed by the&nbsp;placement of a drain.\nIf an abscess is found during surgery, the area is carefully washed out and a course of antibiotics is given."

        "disease": "Arterial thrombosis",
        "description": "Arterial thrombosis is a blood clot that develops in an artery. It&#8217;s dangerous as it can obstruct or stop the flow of blood to major organs, such as the heart or brain.\nIf a blood clot narrows one or more of the arteries leading to the heart, muscle pain known as angina&nbsp;can occur.\nIf a blood clot blocks the arteries leading to part of the heart muscle, it will cause a heart attack. If it blocks an artery in the brain, it will cause a stroke.\nSymptoms therefore depend on where the blood clot has formed.\nMost cases of arterial thrombosis are caused when a process called atherosclerosis&nbsp;damages an artery.\nFatty deposits build up on the walls of the arteries and cause them to harden and narrow.\nThere are two main types of treatment for arterial thrombosis.\nMedication can help dissolve clots and restore the flow of the blood to the brain or heart.\nSurgery involves a surgeon accessing the affected artery. They will either:\n- unblock it\n- re-route the blood flow via another blood vessel\n- “graft” the blood vessel to travel around, or past, the section that&#8217;s blocked\nIf you&#8217;ve had a blood clot in an artery, you may need to take medication to prevent it from happening again.\nIt&#8217;s also vital that you live a healthy lifestyle. This includes:\n- stopping smoking&nbsp;(if you smoke)\n- doing some physical activity\n- reducing the amount of salt and saturated fat that you eat\nDepending on where the clot is in your body, a bloodclot in an artery (arterial thrombosis) can cause:\n- angina\n- heart attack\n- stroke\n- peripheral vascular disease\nFind out about each of these below.\nA heart attack&nbsp;can happen when a blood clot completely blocks an artery that pumps blood to your heart muscle.\nYou may experience:\n- a crushing central chest pain or mild chest discomfort\n- shortness of breath\n- a clammy, sweaty and grey complexion\n- dizziness\n- nausea and vomiting\nIf you suspect you or someone you know is having a heart attack, dial 999 immediately. It&#8217;s important that you don&#8217;t wait and do treat these symptoms as an emergency.\nFind out more about the symptoms of a heart attack\nArterial thrombosis can cause a stroke if a blood clot is blocking an artery that supplies blood to your brain.\nThe symptoms of a stroke can come on suddenly and may include:\n- numbness or weakness down one side, ranging in severity from weakness in your hand to complete paralysis of the whole side of your body\n- weakness in your face, which can make you drool saliva\n- dizziness\n- difficulty talking and understanding what others are saying\n- problems with balance and co-ordination\n- difficulty swallowing\nIf you suspect that you or someone else is having a stroke, dial 999 immediately. It&#8217;s important that you don&#8217;t wait and do treat these symptoms as an emergency.\nIf you have a narrowing of an artery in one or both of your legs (peripheral vascular disease) you may:\n- be more susceptible to developing a clot\n- have pain when exercising, usually in the lower half of your legs\n- have pain that may affect both legs, but develops in one leg before the other\n- have pale, cold skin and numbness in one of your legs\nPeripheral vascular disease can also cause other problems such as impotence (erectile dysfunction).\nIf you have any of these symptoms, it&#8217;s important to talk to your GP.\nIf one of your legs is a very different colour from the other, and you have other symptoms, you should treat this as an emergency and call 999.\nArterial thrombosis occurs when a blood clot forms within an artery, slowing or stopping the flow of blood.\nYour blood contains cells called platelets and proteins (clotting factors). Together they make up the blood-clotting mechanism.\nWhen a blood vessel is cut, the platelets and clotting factors in your blood mesh together to form a solid clot at the site of the wound. This clot acts as a plug to stop the wound from bleeding.\nNormally, the blood-clotting mechanism is triggered when a blood vessel is damaged and bleeds, such as when you cut yourself. However, the blood may sometimes begin to clot even when a blood vessel has not been damaged.\nIf this happens, a blood clot can form within a vein or artery (thrombosis).\nMost cases of arterial thrombosis are caused when an artery is damaged by&nbsp;atherosclerosis.\nFatty deposits build up on the walls of the arteries and cause them to harden and narrow. The risk factors for a blood clot in an artery include:\n- eating a high-fat diet\n- smoking\n- alcohol misuse\n- obesity\n- lack of exercise\n- diabetes (both type 1 diabetes&nbsp;and type 2 diabetes)\n- high blood pressure (hypertension)\nThe tests used to diagnose blood clots in the arteries (arterial thrombosis) will depend on what medical condition the blood clot has triggered.\nSuspected cases of unstable angina and heart attacks are diagnosed using an electrocardiogram (ECG).\nEvery time your heart beats, it produces tiny electrical signals that will show on paper. This allows your doctor to see how well your heart is functioning or if there are any areas not receiving blood as in a heart attack.\nBlood may also be taken to measure levels of a protein called troponin. This is released when the heart muscle is damaged by a heart attack.\nSuspected cases of stroke are diagnosed by producing a scan of the brain using a&nbsp;computed tomography (CT) scan&nbsp;or&nbsp;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.\nThere are two main types of treatment for a blood clot that develops in an artery (arterial thrombosis):\n- medication\n- surgery\nMedication can help dissolve clots and restore the flow of the blood to the brain or heart.\nYou may need a heart procedure if the blood clot is in an artery that supplies blood to your heart.&nbsp;\nA coronary angioplasty is the most common type of procedure for a heart attack.&nbsp;\nA hollow metal tube called a stent is inserted to widen the artery and stop it from blocking again.&nbsp;\nOccasionally, a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) may be carried out after a heart attack.&nbsp;\nA blood vessel that is taken from another part of the body is used to bypass where the blockage is.\nAnother type of surgery for arterial thrombosis is called carotid endarterectomy, which you may have if you have had a blood clot in an artery in your neck (causing a stroke).&nbsp;\nThe surgeon makes a cut in your neck to open up the artery and remove the fatty deposits.&nbsp;\nIt&#8217;s not possible to prevent blood clots altogether, but there are a number of ways to reduce the risks of developing a blood clot in an artery.&nbsp;\nIf you&#8217;ve had blood clot in an artery before, you might need to take medication to prevent it from happening again.&nbsp;\nMedication can include:\n- statins&nbsp;&#8211; used to lower your blood cholesterol levels&nbsp;\n- anticoagulant medicines- such as&nbsp;warfarin\n- antiplatelet medicines &#8211; such as low-dose aspirin or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat high blood pressure)\nIn addition to medication, it&#8217;s vital that you look after your health and take steps to improve your lifestyle.&nbsp;\nMost cases of arterial thrombosis are associated with atherosclerosis&nbsp;(the ‘furring up’ of your arteries with fatty deposits). This can lead to a blood clot in an artery and cause a heart attack or stroke.&nbsp;\nMaking healthy changes to your lifestyle can greatly reduce the effects of this condition, and others such a heart disease.&nbsp;\nThings you could do include:\n- stopping smoking&nbsp;(if you smoke)\n- reduce your alcohol intake to recommended limits\n- reduce salt intake\n- eat at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetables and 2 portions of fish per week (1 oily)\n- do a minimum of 30 minutes of moderate exercise such as walking or cycling at least 5 times a week"

For example, for better financial security and higher self-esteem.\nYou may find work challenging, but your employer should help you get the training and support you need. Speak to your line manager or HR department about your condition to get the right support.\nTreatment can also help you return to work after being diagnosed with arthritis.\nIf your arthritis is so severe that you’re unable to work, help is available. For example, the Personal Independence Payment.\nFurther information on work and arthritis from Versus Arthritis\nIt’s very important to eat a healthy, balanced diet if you have arthritis. Eating healthily will give you all the nutrients you need and help you maintain a healthy weight.\nYour diet should include a variety of foods from all 5 food groups. These are:\n- fruit and vegetables\n- starchy foods – like bread, rice, potatoes and pasta\n- meat, fish, eggs and beans\n- milk and dairy foods\n- foods containing fat and sugar\nFurther information on a healthy, balanced diet\nIf you’re overweight, losing weight can help you cope with arthritis.\nToo much weight places excess pressure on the joints in your hips, knees, ankles and feet. This can lead to more pain and mobility problems.\nFurther information on managing your weight\nIf your arthritis is painful, you may not feel like exercising. But, being active can help reduce and prevent pain.\nAlongside a healthy diet, regular exercise can help you lose weight which will place less strain on your joints.\nRegular exercise can also:\n- improve the range of movement in your joints\n- improve joint mobility\n- increase muscle strength\n- reduce stiffness\n- boost your energy\nAs long as you do the right type and level of exercise for your condition, your arthritis won’t get any worse. Speak to your GP for advice about the type and level of exercise that’s right for you.\nFurther information on exercising with arthritis from Versus Arthritis\nThe Telecare Self-Check online tool can help you find the right support for you in your area.\n"

        "disease": "Asbestosis",
        "description": "Asbestosis is a chronic (long-term) lung condition caused by exposure to asbestos.\nAsbestos is a general term for a group of minerals made of microscopic fibres. In the past, it was widely used as a building material.\nAsbestos can be very dangerous. It does not present a health risk if it&#8217;s undisturbed. But if material containing asbestos is chipped, drilled, broken or allowed to deteriorate, it can release a fine dust that contains asbestos fibres.\nWhen the dust is breathed in, the asbestos fibres enter the lungs and can damage them over time. However, it&#8217;s not the only factor, as many people avoid getting asbestosis, despite heavy exposure.\nThe use of asbestos peaked during the 1970s, before declining during the 1980s and 1990s. You may have been exposed to asbestos if you worked in an industry where asbestos was used during this time.\nJobs particularly linked with exposure to asbestos include:\n- insulation workers\n- boilermakers\n- plumbers, pipefitters and steamfitters\n- shipyard workers\n- sheet metal workers\n- plasterers\n- chemical technicians\n- heating, air-conditioning and refrigeration mechanics\nNowadays, you&#8217;re most at risk if your job puts you at risk of damaging asbestos in older buildings. For example caretakers, electricians and demolition workers.\nYou think you may have been exposed to asbestos in the past and have:\nYour GP may:\n- ask you about your symptoms\n- listen to your lungs with a stethoscope – if your lungs have been affected by asbestos, they&#8217;ll usually make a crackling noise when you breathe in\n- ask about your work history, particularly about possible exposure to asbestos\n- arrange a chest X-ray\nIf asbestosis is suspected, you&#8217;ll be referred to a specialist in lung diseases for tests to confirm any lung scarring. These may include:\n- a computerised tomography (CT) scan\n- lung function tests\nThe specialist will also consider other possible causes of lung inflammation and scarring. For example, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis and connective tissue disease related interstitial lung disease.\nThere is no cure for asbestosis once it has developed. It&#8217;s not possible to reverse the damage to the lungs.\nSometimes, depending on the pattern of scarring seen in the lungs, you may be considered for AntiFibrotic therapy to reduce progression of your lung condition.\nPulmonary rehabilitation may be recommended.\nThere are things you can do to help your symptoms.\nIf you&#8217;ve been diagnosed with asbestosis and you smoke, you should stop as soon as possible.\nSmoking can make breathlessness worse. It can also significantly increase your risk of developing lung cancer.\nSpeak to your GP for help with giving up smoking.\nYou can also phone Quit Your Way Scotland on 0800 84 84 84 to get more help and advice about quitting smoking.\nRead more about stopping smoking.\nIf you have asbestosis, your lungs will be more vulnerable to infection.\nIt&#8217;s recommended that you have the flu vaccine every year to protect against flu. You should also have the pneumococcal vaccine.\nIf you have severe asbestosis, your body may not be getting enough oxygen. Oxygen therapy may be recommended if you have low levels of oxygen in your blood.\nIf you have been diagnosed with asbestosis or other asbestos related lung conditions, you have 3 years from your diagnosis to claim compensation. This can be done through:\n- industrial injuries disablement benefit – a weekly benefit that may be paid to people with asbestosis who were exposed to asbestos while in employment (but not self-employed)\n- a civil claim for compensation through the courts – you&#8217;ll need to obtain legal advice about how to do this\n- a claim for a lump compensation sum under the Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers&#8217; Compensation) Act 1979 – if you have asbestosis, or you&#8217;re the dependent of someone who has died from the condition, and you haven&#8217;t been able to get compensation through the courts because the employer has ceased trading\nRead more about industrial injuries disablement benefit on the GOV.UK website.\nLarge amounts of asbestos are still found in many older buildings. You should take precautions if you live or work in a building that may contain asbestos.\nIf you think your house may contain asbestos, contact an environmental health officer at your local council. Do not attempt to remove any materials that you think may contain asbestos yourself.\nIf your job means you could be exposed to asbestos fibres, make sure you are fully aware of how to reduce your risk. Do not attempt to remove any asbestos you come across, unless you have been trained in how to do this safely."

        "disease": "Asthma",
        "description": "Asthma is a long-term condition caused by inflammation of the airways in the lungs.\nYou can develop asthma at any age.\nSymptoms include:\n- coughing\n- wheezing\n- chest tightness\n- breathlessness\nSymptoms can vary from person to person. They&#8217;re often worse at night and early in the morning, or with certain triggers.\nAsthma is well controlled in most people most of the time. It shouldn&#8217;t restrict your daily life (including your sleep) in any way. You should work with your healthcare professionals to help control your asthma.\nYou have asthma and:\nYour child has asthma and:\nIf your GP practice is closed, phone 111.\nYour inhaler could be empty. Change to another inhaler if you can to check if it helps.\nIf your symptoms improve and you do not need to phone 999, you still need to see a doctor or asthma nurse within 24 hours.\nIf you have symptoms of asthma, your GP may ask you:\n- when your symptoms happen\n- how often you get symptoms\n- if you have noticed any triggers\n- if you have eczema or hay fever\nTests you may be offered include:\n- spirometry – where you breathe into a machine to check how well your lungs work\n- peak expiratory flow test – uses a small hand-held device to measure how fast you can blow air out of your lungs in one breath\n- airways responsiveness – measures how your airways react when they come into contact with a trigger\n- testing airway inflammation – either with a mucus sample or measuring your nitric oxide concentration (a high level can be a sign of airway inflammation)\n- allergy tests – to check if your asthma is linked to allergies like dust mites, pollen, or food\nThere is no cure for asthma but there are treatments that can help:\n- prevent future symptoms and attacks\n- relieve your symptoms\nMost people will take medications once or twice daily, usually using an inhaler. Your nurse, doctor or pharmacist will teach you how to properly use your inhaler.\nWatch Asthma + Lung UK&#8217;s videos on how to use your inhaler\nFinding and avoiding your possible triggers is also important.\nSome treatments may have side effects.\nIf you&#8217;re diagnosed with asthma, your healthcare professional will agree a personal asthma action plan with you. This could include information like:\n- the medicines you need to take\n- how to recognise when your symptoms are getting worse\n- what to do if your symptoms get worse\nYour personal asthma action plan should be reviewed with your nurse, doctor or pharmacist at least once a year. If your symptoms are severe, it can be reviewed more regularly.\nReliever inhalers – may be a blue inhaler or a combination inhaler – help asthma symptoms quickly, usually within 3 to 5 minutes. They widen your airways, making it easier to breathe again. It&#8217;s a short-lived medication and will last for around 4 hours.\nEveryone with asthma should be given a reliever inhaler which may be blue or may be a combination inhaler that you usually use for maintenance treatment. If your asthma is well controlled, you should rarely need to use an extra reliever.\nPreventer inhalers work over time to reduce the inflammation and sensitivity of your airways. They reduce the chances of asthma attacks. They must be used regularly (usually twice a day) to keep asthma under control.\nIt can take a while for your preventer inhaler to work fully. You may still occasionally need to use reliever doses of your blue inhaler or the combination preventer-reliever inhaler.\nIf you smoke, preventer inhalers may not work as well for you.\nIf using reliever and preventer inhalers does not control your asthma, you may need an inhaler that combines both.\nCombination inhalers are used every day to help stop symptoms occurring and provide long-lasting relief if they do occur. Some combination inhalers can also be used as relievers as well as being your usual preventer treatment. This is referred to as MART (Maintenance and reliver Treatment) or AIR (Anti-inflammatory reliever) treatment.\nIt&#8217;s important to use it regularly, even if you do not have symptoms.\nThere is no recycling scheme available for used inhalers. You should return all your used or expired inhalers to your community pharmacy for safe disposal. Spacers should be replaced each year if used regularly. Old spacers go into the household bin.\nUsing your preventer inhaler correctly and keeping your symptoms under control is good for your health and the environment. Some inhalers have a lower carbon footprint and are better for the environment than others. The best inhaler is one that works well for you. Speak to your healthcare professional about whether lower global warming potential inhalers would be right for you.\nIf your asthma isn&#8217;t controlled by using inhalers alone, you may be prescribed:\n- Montelukast – tablets that block part of the chemical reaction involved in the swelling (inflammation) of the airways\n- theophyllines – tablets that help widen the airways by relaxing the muscles around them, and are also relatively weak anti-inflammatory agents\n- biological treatments\nIf your asthma is still not under control, you may be prescribed a short course of oral steroid tablets or, more rarely, regular steroid tablets. This treatment should be monitored by a hospital asthma specialist.\nLong-term use of oral steroids has serious possible side effects, so they&#8217;re only used once other treatments have been tried. Your healthcare professional should talk about the risks and benefits with you. You should be given a steroid treatment card by your healthcare professional.\nBreathing exercises can improve symptoms and reduce the need for reliever medicines in some people. These include breathing exercises taught by a physiotherapist and yoga.\nBreathing and relaxation exercises\nIt&#8217;s not clear exactly what causes asthma. It&#8217;s likely to be a combination of factors.\nYou&#8217;ve a higher chance of having asthma if you have:\n- an allergy such as eczema, allergic rhinitis, food allergy or hay fever\n- a family history of asthma or other similar conditions\n- bronchiolitis (a common childhood lung infection) as a child\n- childhood exposure to tobacco smoke, particularly if your mother also smoked during pregnancy\n- been born prematurely, especially if you needed a ventilator to support your breathing after birth\n- a low birth weight as a result of restricted growth within the womb\nSome people may also be at risk of developing asthma through their job.\nAn asthma trigger is something that irritates your lungs. When you come into contact with a trigger your airways narrow, the muscles around them tighten, and you make more sticky mucus (phlegm).\nCommon asthma triggers include:\n- infections in the upper airways like colds and the flu\n- dust mites\n- animal fur\n- feathers\n- pollen\n- cigarette smoke\n- chemical fumes\n- pollution\n- exercise\n- mould or damp\n- emotions – including stress or laughing\n- food allergies\n- certain weather\n- non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), like aspirin and ibuprofen\n- beta-blockers sometimes given for high blood pressure or some types of heart disease\n- foods containing sulphites – such as concentrated fruit juice, jam, prawns and many processed or pre-cooked meals\nAsthma may also be triggered by allergens or chemicals breathed in at work. Speak to your GP if you think your symptoms are worse at work and get better on holiday.\nYou may be able to help your symptoms by avoiding your asthma triggers.\nSpeak to your nurse, doctor or pharmacist if you have asthma symptoms during or after exercise. They may review your asthma plan to make sure your symptoms are under control.\nThey may also advise that you:\n- make sure the people you&#8217;re exercising with know you have asthma\n- increase your fitness levels slowly\n- always have your reliever inhaler (usually blue) with you when you exercise\n- always warm up and cool down\nIf you have symptoms while you&#8217;re exercising, stop, take your reliever inhaler, and wait until you feel better before starting again.\nRead further information about keeping active\nHormones can change asthma symptoms. For example, around the time of your period, during menopause, and during pregnancy. You should continue to manage your asthma in the same way.\nMake sure your asthma is well controlled during pregnancy.\nMost medicines used for asthma are safe to take during pregnancy and when breastfeeding. You should not take leukotriene receptor antagonists if you&#8217;re pregnant, unless advised to by a healthcare professional."

        "disease": "Ataxia",
        "description": "Ataxia is a term for a group of neurological conditions that affect balance, coordination and speech.\nAny part of the body can be affected by ataxia and it can affect people in different ways.\nPeople with ataxia often find they&#8217;re falling over more or can&#8217;t walk in a straight line.\nOther symptoms can include:\n- becoming more clumsy\n- slurred speech\n- problems with swallowing which can cause choking or coughing\n- tremors or shaking\n- fatigue or tiredness\n- problems with sight like blurred or jumpy vision caused by difficulty controlling eye movements\nSome people experience mild symptoms like slight balance problems. Other people have more severe symptoms and need help to carry out everyday tasks.\nSome types of ataxia are inherited. This means they&#8217;re caused by genes passed on by a parent (or parents) to their child. Other types of ataxia that are not inherited can be caused by different factors like brain damage, diet, or side effects from taking drugs.\nHereditary ataxia is caused by genes you&#8217;ve inherited from your parents. There are different types of&nbsp;hereditary&nbsp;ataxia.\nFriedreichs&#8217; ataxia is the most common form of hereditary ataxia. Symptoms will normally start before the age of 25 but they can develop later.\nSpinocerebellar ataxia (SCA&#8217;s) are caused by mutations in different genes. More than 100 types of SCA&#8217;s have been found through research since 1965.\nAtaxia with oculomotor apraxia (AOA) comes in 2 forms AOA1 or AOA2.\nDentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is a type of inherited cerebellar ataxia which gradually gets worse over time. Symptoms normally begin later in life.\nEpisodic ataxia is a rare type of hereditary ataxia where a person has episodes or attacks of ataxia symptoms. The episodes can be triggered (caused) by environmental factors like stress, caffeine, alcohol, medication, physical activity or illness.\nThere are two ways of ataxia being inherited.\nIf you have ataxia that&#8217;s autosomal recessive, it means you&#8217;ve inherited the mutated gene from both of your parents.\nIf you only receive one mutated gene from one parent, you&#8217;ll be a carrier for ataxia. This means you won&#8217;t have the condition yourself but could pass it on to your children, if the other parent is also a carrier of the faulty gene.\nIf 2 people who carry the mutated gene were to have a baby there&#8217;d be a:\n- 1 in 4 chance the baby would receive a pair of normal genes\n- 1 in 2 chance the baby would receive one normal gene and one mutated gene and therefore be a carrier\n- 1 in 4 chance the baby would receive a pair of mutated genes and would have ataxia\nIf you have autosomal recessive ataxia and your partner doesn&#8217;t and isn&#8217;t a carrier, any children you have won&#8217;t have this type of ataxia. Your children will be carriers of the mutated gene.\nIf you have autosomal recessive ataxia and your partner is a carrier there&#8217;s\n- a 1 in 2 chance your children will receive one normal gene and one mutated gene and won&#8217;t have ataxia but will be a carrier\n- a 1 in 2 chance your children will receive a pair of mutated genes and will develop ataxia\nIf you have autosomal dominant ataxia, you can develop the condition even if you only receive one faulty gene from either parent. This is because the mutated gene is stronger and overrides the normal gene.\nAny children of someone with autosomal dominant ataxia will have a 1 in 2 chance of developing ataxia.\nAcquired ataxia can develop during someone&#8217;s life caused by something other than a gene mutation.\nThis type of ataxia can be caused by:\n- conditions like stroke, haemorrhage or transient ischaemic attack (TIA)\n- gluten intolerance\n- severe head injury\n- vitamin deficiency like vitamin E or vitamin B12 deficiency\n- drinking too much alcohol over a long period of time (alcohol overuse)\n- recreational inhalants (like nitrous oxide)\n- bacterial brain infection like meningitis\n- viral infection\n- cerebral palsy\n- multiple sclerosis\n- an underactive thyroid\n- cancer\n- medication like benzodiazepines\nIt&#8217;s possible for someone with acquired ataxia to reduce their symptoms (and sometimes stop them altogether) by making changes to their diet or lifestyle.\nYou should speak to your doctor before making changes to your diet.\nIdiopathic ataxia is a type of ataxia where the cause is not known. Around 50% of people with ataxia have idiopathic ataxia.\nPeople with gluten ataxia are sensitive to a protein in gluten which is found in wheat products.&nbsp;It&#8217;s a type of sporadic idiopathic ataxia found in people with no family history of ataxia and no known cause.\nIn most cases, ataxia is caused by damage to the cerebellum (a part of the brain). It can also be caused by damage to the spinal cord or nerves.\nThe spinal cord is a long collection of nerves that runs down the spine connecting the brain to other parts of the body.\nThe cerebellum is at the base of the brain and controls:\n- eye movements\n- speech\n- co-ordination of arms and legs\n- balance\nIt can be difficult to get a diagnosis of the specific type of ataxia because there are many conditions that can appear very similar.\nA neurologist (doctor that specialises in conditions affecting the brain) might need to do a number of tests to give an accurate diagnosis and this can take some time.\nIf your symptoms suggest you&#8217;ve acquired ataxia because of a serious underlying condition, you&#8217;ll likely be admitted to hospital. If not, you&#8217;ll be referred to a neurologist for more tests.\nA doctor might ask about your symptoms and how they&#8217;ve progressed. They might assess your balance, walking and co-ordination.\nThe doctor might ask how much alcohol you drink and what medication you take. This is because drinking too much and some medications can cause symptoms similar to ataxia in some people.\nYou might be referred for blood or urine tests to rule out other causes like infection.\nThe doctor will also ask if you have a family history of ataxia. Even if no one in your family is affected, this does not mean ataxia cannot be inherited.\nA brain scan might be used to check for physical changes in the brain that could be caused by certain types of hereditary ataxia.\nYou might have a computerised tomography (CT scan) or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.\nOther test you might have to help your doctor diagnose ataxia might include:\n- a lumbar puncture to take a sample of cerebrospinal fluid from the base of the spine to check for infection\n- electromyography (EMG) or nerve conduction studies to test the electrical activity in nerves and muscles\n- videoflouroscopy (a moving X-ray) while you swallow different types of food and drink\n- an electrocardiogram (ECG) to assess the electrical activity of the heart\n- an echocardiogram which is an ultrasound scan of the heart\nThere is no cure for ataxia. If the underlying cause of your ataxia is known, this can sometimes be treated which can help improve symptoms or stop your ataxia getting worse. There are treatments available to help with the symptoms.\nIt might be possible to improve your ataxia or stop it getting worse if the underlying cause is known and is treatable.\nThe underlying cause might be treatable if you have:\n- ataxia with vitamin E deficiency as this can often be improved with vitamin E supplements\n- episodic ataxia as it can often be improved by taking a medication called acetazolamide and by avoiding triggers like caffeine, stress and alcohol\n- acquired ataxia as it can sometimes be treated if the specific cause is something like an infection where antibiotics or antiviral treatment might help\nIf acquired ataxia is caused by brain damage from a stroke or severe head injury, it might not be possible to treat the condition.\nThere are treatments available to help with some of the symptoms.\nIf you have slurred speech (dysarthria) or swallowing problems (dysphagia), you might see a speech and language therapist.\nYou might be referred to a dietitian for dietary advice if you have swallowing problems.\nOccupational therapy can help teach you how to adapt if you lose your mobility. It&#8217;ll help you develop new skills and teach you new ways of doing daily tasks.\nThe occupational therapist can advise how you can modify your home to make it more accessible. For example, they might suggest installing a stair lift or guide rails to make it easier for you to get around your house safely.\nThey might teach you how to use a wheelchair or other mobility devices.\nAn occupational therapist can also advise how to adapt your daily activities to help you cope better with fatigue.\nPhysiotherapy will aim to help you maintain the use of your arms and legs. It&#8217;ll try to prevent your muscles weakening or getting stuck in one position. They&#8217;ll also try to help you increase your stamina to cope with fatigue.\nThe physiotherapist might teach you physical exercises you can do to strengthen and stretch your muscles.\nThey&#8217;ll recommend walking aids if you need them to help you get around.\nIf you have muscle problems like muscle spasms, cramps and stiffness, you might be given relaxant medication like baclofen or tizanidine.\nIf these don&#8217;t work, you might be offered botulinum toxin injections (botox). This will block the signals from your brain to the affected muscles. The effects can last for up to 3 months.\nAtaxia can cause bladder problems like urinary urgency, or sometimes, urinary incontinence.\nSometimes, bladder problems can be improved by self care techniques like limiting fluid intake during the day and planning regular trips to the toilet. Avoiding drinks like caffeine and alcohol that can stimulate urine production can also help.\nYou might be offered medication called antimuscarinic to help relax the bladder. This works by reducing the frequent urge to pee (urinate). Injections of botulinum toxin (botox) into the bladder might help too.\nSome people with ataxia can find it hard to completely empty their bladder. This can lead to urine leaking out later on. If this happens, it might be necessary to insert a small tube in to the bladder (urinary catheter) to help drain the pee (urine).\nOscillopsia is an eye problem caused by involuntary movement of the eyes from side to side or up and down. It can cause visual disruption, making tasks like reading very difficult.&nbsp;This can sometimes be treated by medication like gabapentin to control the muscles that move the eyes.\nYou might experience double vision where you see 2 images of an object. This can sometimes be treated by fitting a wedge shaped piece of glass or plastic (prism) to your glasses.\nSome men with ataxia have difficulty getting or maintaining an erection (erectile dysfunction) because of underlying nerve damage.\nThis can be treated with medication which helps increase blood flow to the penis.\nIf you have nerve pain, it might be caused by damage to the nerve endings (neuropathic pain). It&#8217;s usually described as a burning, aching, shooting or tingling pain in parts of your body.\nYou might be prescribed amitriptyline, gabapentin or pregabalin to help with the pain. Traditional painkillers like paracetamol, ibuprofen codeine aren&#8217;t usually effective in treating this type of neuropathic pain.\nDamage to the heart muscle, known as cardiomyopathy can be a feature of inherited ataxia.\nIt can:\n- put a strain on the heart\n- affect blood flow through the heart\n- cause heart irregularities (arrhythmias)\nIf you experience cardiomyopathy, you&#8217;ll see a cardiologist (specialist heart doctor) for regular check ups and might be prescribed medication.\nPeople with ataxia who have depression or anxiety can be treated with antidepressants or therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy CBT."

        "description": "Atopic eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is the most common form of eczema. It mainly affects children, but can also affect adults.\nEczema is a condition that causes the skin to become itchy, red, dry and cracked. It is a long-term (chronic) condition in most people, although it can improve over time, especially in children.\nAtopic eczema&nbsp;can affect any part of the body,&nbsp;but the most common areas to be affected are:\n- backs or fronts of&nbsp;the knees\n- outside or inside of the elbows\n- around the neck\n- hands\n- cheeks\n- scalp\nPeople with atopic eczema usually&nbsp;have periods when symptoms are less noticeable, as well as periods when symptoms become more severe (flare-ups).\nRead more about the&nbsp;symptoms of atopic eczema&nbsp;and&nbsp;diagnosing atopic eczema.\nThe exact cause of atopic eczema is unknown, but it&#8217;s clear it&#8217;s not down to one single thing. It often occurs in people who get&nbsp;allergies&nbsp;– &#8220;atopic&#8221; means sensitivity to allergens.\nIt&nbsp;can run in families, and often&nbsp;develops alongside other conditions, such as&nbsp;asthma&nbsp;and&nbsp;hay fever.\nThe symptoms of atopic eczema&nbsp;often have certain&nbsp;triggers, such as&nbsp;soaps, detergents, stress and the weather.&nbsp;Sometimes&nbsp;food allergies&nbsp;can play a part, especially in young children with severe eczema.\nRead&nbsp;more about the&nbsp;causes of atopic eczema.\nThere is currently no cure for atopic eczema, but treatment can&nbsp;help relieve the symptoms and many cases improve over time.\nHowever, severe eczema often has a significant impact on daily life and may be difficult to&nbsp;cope with physically and mentally. There is also an increased risk of skin infections.&nbsp;\nMany different treatments can be used to control symptoms and manage eczema, including:\n- self care techniques,&nbsp;such as reducing scratching and avoiding triggers\n- emollients&nbsp;(moisturising treatments)&nbsp;–&nbsp;used on a daily basis for dry skin&nbsp;\n- topical corticosteroids– used to reduce swelling, redness and itching during flare-ups\nIf you have atopic eczema or symptoms of atopic eczema you can get advice and treatment directly from a pharmacy. Find your local pharmacy on Scotland&#8217;s Service Directory.\nAtopic eczema isn&#8217;t usually serious and can be treated by a pharmacist. Your pharmacist may recommend that you contact your GP practice if required.\nRead more about&nbsp;treating&nbsp;atopic eczema&nbsp;and the&nbsp;complications of atopic eczema.\nAbout 1&nbsp;in 5&nbsp;children in the UK has atopic eczema. In 8 out of 10 cases, the condition develops before a child reaches the age of 5. Many children develop it before their first birthday.\nAtopic eczema can improve significantly, or even clear completely, in some children as they get older. About half of all cases improve a lot by the time a child reaches 11 years, and around two-thirds improve&nbsp;by the age of 16.\nHowever, the condition can continue into adulthood and can sometimes develop for the first time in adults.\nAtopic eczema causes areas of skin to become itchy, dry, cracked, sore and red.\nThere will usually be periods where the symptoms improve, followed by periods where they get worse (flare-ups). Flare-ups may occur as often as 2&nbsp;or 3&nbsp;times a month.\nAtopic eczema can occur all over the body, but is most common on the hands (especially fingers), the insides of the elbows or backs of the knees, and the face and scalp in children. The face is more commonly involved in adults.\nThe severity of atopic eczema can vary a lot from person to person. People with mild eczema may only have small areas of dry skin that are occasionally itchy. In more severe cases, atopic eczema can cause widespread red, inflamed skin all over the body and constant itching.\nScratching can disrupt your sleep, make your skin bleed, and cause secondary infections. It can also make itching worse, and a cycle of itching and regular scratching may develop. This can lead to sleepless nights and difficulty concentrating at school or work.\nAreas of skin affected by eczema may also turn temporarily darker or lighter after the condition has improved. This is more noticeable in people with darker skin. It&#8217;s not&nbsp;a result of&nbsp;scarring or a side effect of steroid creams, but more of a &#8220;footprint&#8221; of old inflammation&nbsp;and will eventually return to its normal colour.\nOccasionally, areas of skin affected by atopic eczema can become infected. Signs of an infection can include:\n- your eczema getting a lot worse\n- fluid oozing from the skin\n- a yellow crust on the skin surface or small yellowish-white spots appearing in the eczema\n- the skin becoming swollen and sore\n- a high temperature (fever) and generally feeling unwell\nSee your doctor as soon as possible if you think your or your child&#8217;s skin may have become infected.\nRead more about infections and other&nbsp;complications of atopic eczema.\nAtopic eczema is likely to be caused by a combination of things.\nPeople with atopic eczema often have very dry skin because their skin is unable to retain&nbsp;much moisture.\nThis dryness may make&nbsp;the skin more likely to react to certain triggers, causing it to become red and itchy.\nYou may be born with an increased likelihood of developing atopic eczema because of the genes you inherit from your parents.\nResearch has shown children who have 1&nbsp;or both parents with atopic eczema, or who have other siblings with eczema, are more likely to develop it themselves.\nAtopic eczema is not infectious, so it cannot be passed on through close contact.\nThere are a number of things that may trigger your eczema symptoms. These can vary from person to person.\nCommon&nbsp;triggers include:\n- irritants –&nbsp;such as&nbsp;soaps and detergents, including shampoo, washing up liquid&nbsp;and bubble bath\n- environmental factors or&nbsp;allergens– such as cold and dry weather, dampness, and more specific things such as house dust mites, pet fur, pollen and moulds\n- food allergies– such as allergies to&nbsp;cows&#8217; milk, eggs, peanuts, soya or wheat\n- certain&nbsp;materials worn next to the skin – such as wool and synthetic fabrics\n- hormonal changes – women may find their symptoms get worse in the days before their period or during pregnancy\n- skin infections\nSome people also report their symptoms get worse when the air is dry or dusty, or when they are stressed,&nbsp;sweaty, or too hot or too cold.\nIf you are diagnosed with atopic eczema, your pharmacist or GP will work with you to try to identify any triggers for your symptoms. Read more about&nbsp;diagnosing atopic eczema.\nYour GP will usually be able to diagnose atopic eczema by looking at your skin and asking questions about your symptoms.\nThese questions may include asking:\n- whether the rash is itchy and where it appears\n- when the symptoms first began\n- whether it comes and goes over time\n- whether there is a history of atopic eczema in your family\n- whether you have any other conditions, such as&nbsp;allergies&nbsp;or&nbsp;asthma\nYou should tell your pharmacist or GP if your condition is affecting your quality of life&nbsp;– for example, if you&nbsp;have difficulty sleeping because of itching, or&nbsp;your eczema limits your everyday&nbsp;activities.\nTypically, to be diagnosed with atopic eczema you should have had an itchy skin condition in the last 12 months and 3&nbsp;or more of the following:\n- visibly irritated red skin in the creases of your skin, such as the insides of your elbows or behind your knees (or on the cheeks, outsides of elbows, or fronts of the knees in children aged 18 months or under) at the time of examination by a health professional\n- a history of skin irritation occurring in the same areas mentioned above\n- generally dry skin in the last 12 months\n- a history of asthma or&nbsp;hay fever– children under 4&nbsp;must have an immediate relative, such as a parent, brother or sister, who has one of these conditions\n- the condition started before the age of 2&nbsp;(this does not apply to children under the age of 4)\nYour pharmacist should work with you to establish if any triggers make your eczema worse.&nbsp;\nYou may be asked about your diet and lifestyle to see if something obvious may be contributing to your symptoms. For example, you may have noticed some soaps or shampoos make the eczema worse.\nYou may also be asked to keep a food diary to try to determine whether a specific food makes your symptoms worse.\nA food diary involves writing down everything you eat and making a record of any eczema flare-ups you have. Your pharmacist can then use the diary to see if there is a pattern between your symptoms and what you eat.\nAllergy tests&nbsp;are not usually needed to identify triggers, although they are sometimes helpful in identifying food allergies that may be triggering symptoms in young children or in those where a food allergy is suspected.\nRead more about&nbsp;triggers and causes of atopic eczema.\nThere is no cure for atopic eczema, but treatments can ease the symptoms. Many children find their symptoms naturally improve as they get older.\nThe main treatments for atopic eczema are:\n- emollients&nbsp;(moisturisers) – used every day to stop the skin becoming dry\n- topical corticosteroids– creams and ointments used to reduce swelling and redness during flare-ups\nOther treatments include topical pimecrolimus or tacrolimus for eczema in sensitive sites not responding to simpler treatment,&nbsp;antihistamines for severe itching, bandages or special body suits to allow the body to heal underneath, or more powerful treatments offered by a dermatologist (skin specialist).\nThe various treatments for&nbsp;atopic eczema are outlined below.&nbsp;\nAs well as the treatments mentioned above, there are things&nbsp;you can&nbsp;do yourself to help ease&nbsp;your symptoms and prevent further problems.&nbsp;\nEczema is often itchy and it can be very tempting to scratch the affected areas of skin. But scratching usually damages the skin, which can itself cause more eczema to occur.\nThe skin eventually thickens into leathery areas as a result of chronic scratching. Deep scratching also causes bleeding and increases the risk of your skin becoming infected or scarred.\nTry to reduce scratching whenever possible. You could try gently rubbing your skin with your fingers instead. If your baby has atopic eczema, anti-scratch mittens may stop them scratching their skin.\nKeep your nails short and clean to minimise damage to the skin from unintentional scratching. Keep your skin covered with light clothing to reduce damage from habitual scratching.\nYour pharmacist will work with you to&nbsp;establish what might&nbsp;trigger the eczema flare-ups, although&nbsp;it may get better or worse for no obvious reason.\nOnce you know&nbsp;your triggers, you can try to avoid them.&nbsp;For example:\n- if certain fabrics irritate your skin, avoid wearing these and stick to soft, fine-weave clothing or natural materials such as cotton\n- if heat aggravates your eczema, keep the rooms in your home cool, especially the bedroom\n- avoid using soaps or detergents that may affect your skin&nbsp;– use soap substitutes instead\nAlthough&nbsp;some people with eczema are allergic to house dust mites, trying to rid your home of them isn&#8217;t recommended&nbsp;as it can be difficult and there is no clear evidence that it helps.\nRead more about&nbsp;preventing allergies.\nSome foods, such as eggs and cows&#8217; milk, can trigger eczema symptoms. However, you should not make significant changes to your diet without first speaking to your pharmacist or GP.\nIt may not be healthy to cut these foods from your diet, especially in young children who need the calcium, calories and protein from these foods.\nIf your GP suspects you have a&nbsp;food allergy, you may be referred to a dietitian (a specialist in diet and nutrition), who can help work out a way to avoid the food you&#8217;re allergic to while ensuring you still get all the nutrition you need.\nAlternatively, you may be referred to a hospital specialist such as an immunologist, dermatologist or paediatrician.\nIf you are breastfeeding a baby with atopic eczema, get medical advice before making any changes to your regular diet.\nEmollients are moisturising treatments applied directly to the skin to reduce water loss and cover it with a protective film. They are often used to help manage dry or scaly skin conditions such as atopic eczema.\nIn addition to making the skin feel less dry, they may also have a mild anti-inflammatory role, and can help reduce the number of flare-ups you have.\nSeveral different emollients are available. You may need to try a few to find one that works for you. You may also be advised to use a mix of emollients, such as:\n- an ointment for very dry skin\n- a cream or lotion for less dry skin\n- an emollient to use instead of soap\n- an emollient to add to bath water or use in the shower\n- one emollient to use on your face and hands, and a different one to use on your body\nThe difference between lotions, creams and ointments is the amount of oil they contain. Ointments contain the most oil so they can be quite greasy, but are the most effective at keeping moisture in the skin.\nLotions contain the least amount of oil so are not greasy, but can be less effective. Creams are somewhere in between.\nIf you have been using a particular emollient for some time, it may eventually become less effective or may start to irritate your skin.\nIf this is the case, your pharmacist will be able to recommend another product that suits you better. The best emollient is the one you feel happy using every day.\nUse your emollient all the time, even if you are not experiencing symptoms. Many people find it helpful to keep separate supplies of emollients at work or school, or a tub in the bathroom and one in a living area.\nTo apply the emollient:\n- use a large amount\n- don&#8217;t rub it in&nbsp;– smooth it into the skin in the same direction the hair grows instead\n- after a bath or shower, gently pat the skin dry and&nbsp;apply the emollient while the skin is still moist to keep the moisture in\nYou should use an emollient at least twice a day if you can, or more often if you have very dry skin.\nDuring a flare-up, apply generous amounts of emollient more frequently, but remember to treat inflamed skin with a topical corticosteroid&nbsp;as emollients used&nbsp;on their own&nbsp;are not enough to control it.\nDon&#8217;t put your fingers into an emollient pot – use a spoon or pump dispenser instead, as this reduces the risk of infection. And never share your emollient with other people.\nIf your skin is sore and inflamed, your pharmacist may recommend a topical corticosteroid (applied directly to your skin), which can reduce the inflammation within a few days.\nTopical corticosteroids can be prescribed in different strengths, depending on the severity of your atopic eczema and the areas of skin affected.\nThey can be very mild (such as hydrocortisone), moderate (such as clobetasone butyrate), or even stronger (such as mometasone).\nIf you need to use corticosteroids frequently, see your GP regularly so they can check the treatment is working effectively and you are using the right amount.\nDon&#8217;t be afraid to apply the treatment to affected areas to control your eczema. Unless instructed otherwise by your doctor, follow the directions on the patient information leaflet that comes with your medication. This will give details of how much to apply.\nMost people will only have to apply it once a day as there is no evidence there is any benefit to applying it more often.\nWhen using a topical corticosteroid:\n- apply your emollient first and ideally wait around 30 minutes until the emollient has soaked into your skin, or apply the corticosteroid at a different time of day (such as at night)\n- apply the recommended amount of the topical corticosteroid to the affected area\n- continue to use it until 48 hours after the flare-up has cleared so the inflammation under the skin surface is treated\nOccasionally, your doctor may suggest using a topical corticosteroid less frequently, but over a longer period of time. This is designed&nbsp;to help prevent flare-ups.\nThis is sometimes called &#8220;weekend treatment&#8221;, where a person who has already gained control of their eczema uses the topical corticosteroid every weekend on the trouble sites to prevent them becoming active again.\nTopical corticosteroids may cause a mild stinging sensation for less than a minute as you apply them.\nIn rare cases, they may also cause:\n- thinning of the skin&nbsp;– especially if the strong steroids are used in the wrong places, such as the face, for too long (for example, several weeks)\n- changes in skin colour&nbsp;– usually, skin&nbsp;lightening after many months of using very strong steroids, but most lightening&nbsp;after eczema is a &#8220;footprint&#8221; of old inflammation and nothing to do with treatments\n- acne(spots)&nbsp;– especially when used on the face in teenagers\n- increased hair growth\nMost of these side effects will improve once treatment stops.\nGenerally, using a strong topical corticosteroid for many months,&nbsp;using them in sensitive areas such as the&nbsp;face, armpits or groin, or using a large amount will increase your risk of side effects. For this reason, you should be prescribed the weakest effective treatment to control your symptoms.\nAntihistamines are a type of medicine that blocks the effects of a substance in the blood called histamine. They&nbsp;can help relieve the itching associated with atopic eczema.\nThey can either&nbsp;be sedating, which cause drowsiness,&nbsp;or&nbsp;non-sedating. If you have severe itching, your pharmacist may suggest trying&nbsp;a non-sedating antihistamine.\nIf itching during a flare-up affects your sleep, your pharmacist may suggest taking a sedating&nbsp;antihistamine. Sedating&nbsp;antihistamines can cause drowsiness into the following day, so it may be helpful to let your child&#8217;s school know they may not be as alert as normal.\nIn some cases, your GP may prescribe special medicated bandages, clothing or wet wraps to wear over areas of skin affected by eczema.&nbsp;\nThese can either be used over emollients or with topical corticosteroids to prevent scratching, allow the skin underneath to heal, and stop the skin drying out.\nCorticosteroid tablets are rarely used to treat atopic eczema nowadays, but may occasionally be prescribed for short periods of 5 to 7 days to help bring particularly severe flare-ups under control.\nLonger courses of treatment are generally avoided because of the risk of potentially serious side effects.\nIf your GP thinks your condition may be severe enough to benefit from repeated or prolonged treatment with corticosteroid tablets, they will probably refer you to a specialist.\nIn some cases, your GP may refer you to a specialist in treating skin conditions (dermatologist).\nYou may be referred if your GP is not sure what type of eczema you have, normal treatment is not your eczema, your eczema is affecting your daily life, or it&#8217;s not clear what is causing it.\nA dermatologist may be able to offer the following:\n- a thorough review of your existing treatment – to make sure you are using enough of the right things at the right times\n- topical calcineurin inhibitors – creams and ointments that suppress your immune system, such as&nbsp;pimecrolimus and tacrolimus\n- very strong topical corticosteroids\n- bandages or wet wraps\n- phototherapy – ultraviolet (UV) light that reduces inflammation\n- immunosuppressant tablets – to suppress your immune system, such as azathioprine, ciclosporin and methotrexate\n- alitretinoin – medicine to treat severe eczema affecting the hands in adults\nA dermatologist may also offer additional support to help you use your treatments correctly, such as demonstrations from nurse specialists, and they may be able to refer you for psychological support if you feel you&nbsp;need it.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nPeople with atopic eczema can sometimes develop further physical and psychological problems.\nAs atopic eczema can cause your skin to become cracked and broken, there is a risk of the skin becoming infected with bacteria. The risk is higher if you scratch your eczema or do not use your treatments correctly.\nSigns of a bacterial infection can include:\n- fluid oozing from the skin\n- a yellow crust on the skin surface\n- small yellowish-white spots appearing in the eczema\n- the skin becoming swollen and sore\n- a high temperature (fever) and generally feeling unwell\nYour normal symptoms may also get rapidly worse and your eczema may not respond to your regular treatments.\nYou should see your doctor as soon as possible if you think your or your child&#8217;s skin may have become infected.\nThey will usually prescribe antibiotic tablets, capsules or cream to treat the infection, as well as making sure the skin inflammation that led to the infection is well controlled.\nSpeak to your pharmacist or GP if these don&#8217;t help or your symptoms get worse.\nOnce your infection has cleared, your GP should prescribe new supplies of any creams and ointments you&#8217;re using to avoid contamination. Old treatments should be disposed of.\nIt&#8217;s also possible for eczema to become infected with the herpes simplex virus, which normally causes&nbsp;cold sores. This can develop into a serious condition called eczema herpeticum.\nSymptoms of eczema herpeticum include:\n- areas of painful eczema that quickly get worse\n- groups of fluid-filled blisters that break open and leave small, shallow open sores on the skin\n- a high temperature and generally feeling unwell, in some cases&nbsp;\nContact your&nbsp;doctor immediately if you think you or your child may have eczema herpeticum. If you cannot contact your GP, call NHS 111 or go to your nearest hospital.\nIf you are diagnosed with&nbsp;eczema herpeticum, you will be given an antiviral medication called aciclovir.\nAs well as affecting you physically, atopic eczema may also affect you psychologically.\nPreschool children with atopic eczema may be more likely to have behavioural problems such as hyperactivity than children who do not have the condition. They are also more likely to be more dependent on their parents.\nSchoolchildren may experience teasing or bullying if they have atopic eczema. Any kind of bullying can be&nbsp;traumatic and difficult for a child to deal with.\nYour child may&nbsp;become quiet and withdrawn. Explain the situation to your child&#8217;s teacher and encourage your child to tell you how they are feeling.\nThe National Eczema Society provides information about&nbsp;regional support groups, where you may be able to meet other people living with atopic eczema.\nSleep-related problems are common among people with eczema.\nA lack of sleep may affect mood and behaviour. It may also make it more difficult to concentrate at school or work.&nbsp;\nIf your child has problems sleeping&nbsp;because of their&nbsp;eczema,&nbsp;they may fall behind with their schoolwork. It&nbsp;might help&nbsp;to let&nbsp;their teacher know about their condition so it can be taken into consideration.\nDuring a severe&nbsp;eczema flare-up, your child may need time off from school. This may also affect their ability to keep up with their studies.\nAtopic eczema can affect the self-confidence of both adults and children. Children may find it particularly difficult to deal with their condition, which may&nbsp;lead to&nbsp;them having a poor self-image.\nIf your child is severely lacking in confidence, it may affect their ability to develop social skills. Support and encouragement will help boost your child&#8217;s self-confidence and give them a more positive attitude about their appearance.\nSpeak to your GP if you are concerned your child&#8217;s eczema is severely affecting their confidence. They may benefit from specialist psychological support.\n&nbsp;"

        "disease": "Atrial fibrillation",
        "description": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common irregular heart rhythm (arrhythmia).\nIn atrial fibrillation, the top chambers of the heart (the atria) can quiver or twitch (fibrillate). This causes the heart to beat irregularly.\nAtrial fibrillation is not usually life threatening in itself. Many people live normal healthy lives with this condition. But, in some cases treatment will be needed or recommended.\nFor some people, atrial fibrillation could create blood clots in the heart that may lead to a stroke. The risk of this is influenced by other factors, including:\n- age (being older)\n- whether you have high blood pressure\n- heart failure\n- diabetes\n- a previous history of blood clots\nLifestyle changes and treatment can reduce this risk.\nSome people with atrial fibrillation have no symptoms. Many will not even be aware that they have an irregular heartbeat. Sometimes it&#8217;s only discovered during routine tests or investigations for another condition.\nThe most obvious symptom of atrial fibrillation is palpitations. Palpitation is an awareness of your heartbeat. For example, your heart might feel like it’s pounding, fluttering or beating irregularly. You may feel these sensations in your chest, throat or neck.\nYou may feel that your heart is beating fast, even when you&#8217;re not exercising.\nYou may also experience:\n- tiredness\n- breathlessness\n- dizziness\n- feeling faint\n- chest discomfort or pain\nYou or someone else has heart palpitations and:\nAtrial fibrillation can be:\n- intermittent (paroxysmal) – it lasts for a few minutes or hours\n- persistent – episode lasts for more than 7 days\n- long-term persistent – it&#8217;s continuous and can last over a year\n- permanent – it does not go away\nAtrial fibrillation can come and go, lasting between a few minutes or a few hours. This is known as paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. This means it can be hard to detect paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.\nA portable or ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) recorder can help to diagnose paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. This is because it records your heart rate for 24 hours or longer.\nIn some cases, atrial fibrillation can be detected by a:\n- pulse check\n- single lead ECG device – such as a single sensor attached to the chest or contained in a watch strap\nIf your doctor thinks you may have atrial fibrillation, you may be referred for other tests. These can include an:\n- 12 lead ECG – a more detailed recording of the heart rhythm from 12 sensors attached to the chest\n- echocardiogram\nYou may not need treatment if your doctor has assessed your health and your heart rate returns to normal. Your doctor will decide if you would benefit from any treatment.\nThis video shows you how to check your pulse.\nAnticoagulant medicines prevent harmful blood clots from forming. They are sometimes called blood thinners, but they do not actually thin the blood. Instead they increase the time it takes for your blood to form a clot.\nPeople with atrial fibrillation who are at risk of having a stroke may be prescribed anticoagulant medication. This is to reduce the risk of blood clots forming within the heart which can increase the risk of stroke.\nOther treatments for atrial fibrillation focus on controlling the rate and rhythm of the heart. They include:\n- medication, like beta blockers and anti-arrhythmic drugs\n- ablation\n- having a pacemaker fitted\n- cardioversion\nThe kind of treatment you will need for atrial fibrillation will depend on:\n- the type of atrial fibrillation\n- symptoms\n- any underlying cause like an overactive thyroid\n- age\n- overall health"

        "description": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a group of behavioural symptoms that include:\n- difficulty concentrating and paying attention\n- hyperactivity\n- impulsiveness\nSymptoms of ADHD tend to be noticed at an early age. They may become more noticeable when a child&#8217;s circumstances change, like when they start school.\nThe main symptoms of ADHD in children and teenagers are:\nThe main signs of inattentiveness are:\n- having a short attention span\n- being easily distracted\n- making careless mistakes\n- appearing forgetful\n- losing things\n- being unable to stick at tedious or time-consuming tasks\n- appearing to be unable to listen to or carry out instructions\n- constantly changing activity or task\n- having difficulty organising tasks\nThe main signs of hyperactivity and impulsiveness are:\n- being unable to sit still, especially in quiet surroundings\n- constantly fidgeting\n- being unable to concentrate on tasks\n- excessive physical movement\n- excessive talking\n- being unable to wait their turn\n- acting without thinking\n- interrupting conversations\n- little or no sense of danger\nIf you&#8217;re an adult with ADHD, you may find that:\n- you get easily distracted and find it hard to notice details, particularly with things you find boring\n- it&#8217;s hard to listen to other people – you may find yourself finishing their sentences for them or interrupting them\n- it&#8217;s hard to follow instructions\n- you find it hard to organise yourself – you start a lot of things without ever finishing them\n- you find it hard to wait\n- you fidget and can&#8217;t sit still when there&#8217;s nothing much going on\n- you&#8217;re forgetful and tend to lose or misplace things\n- you easily get irritable, impatient or frustrated and lose your temper quickly\n- you feel restless or edgy, have difficulty turning your thoughts off\n- you find stress hard to handle\n- you tend to do things on the spur of the moment, without thinking, which gets you into trouble\nSome people with ADHD have problems with inattentiveness, but not with hyperactivity or impulsiveness.\nSome people might have other conditions alongside ADHD.&nbsp;\nSome children may also have signs of other problems or conditions alongside ADHD, like:\n- anxiety disorder\n- oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) – this involves negative and disruptive behaviour, particularly towards figures of authority\n- conduct disorder – this often involves antisocial behaviour, like stealing and harming people or animals\n- depression\n- sleep problems\n- autistic spectrum disorder (ASD)\n- epilepsy\n- Tourette’s syndrome\n- learning difficulties, like dyslexia\nThe symptoms of ADHD can improve with age. Although many adults diagnosed with the condition at a young age continue to experience problems.\nADHD in adults can occur alongside several related problems or conditions.\nOne of the most common conditions is depression. Other conditions that adults may have alongside ADHD include:\n- personality disorders\n- bipolar disorder\n- obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)\nADHD can also cause problems like difficulties with relationships and social interaction.\nThe exact cause of ADHD isn&#8217;t fully understood.\nA combination of the following factors might be responsible:\nADHD tends to run in families. The genes you you inherit from your parents are a factor in developing the condition. The way ADHD is inherited is complex and isn&#8217;t thought to be related to a single gene.\nResearch has identified some possible differences in the brains of people with ADHD.\nSome studies involving brain scans have suggested that certain areas of the brain may be a different size in people with ADHD.\nOther studies have suggested that people with ADHD may have a chemical imbalance in the brain. Or that some chemicals may not work properly.\nCertain people are also believed to be more at risk of ADHD, including people:\n- who were born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy) or with a low birthweight\n- with epilepsy\n- with brain damage – which happened either in the womb or after a severe head injury later in life\nSpeak to your GP if you think that you or your child may have ADHD.\nIf you&#8217;re worried about your child, it may help to speak to their teachers before seeing your GP. This means you can find out if they have any concerns about your child&#8217;s behaviour.\nYour GP can&#8217;t formally diagnose ADHD. They can discuss your concerns with you and refer you for a specialist assessment, if necessary.\nTreatment for ADHD can help relieve the symptoms.\nADHD can be treated using medication or therapy. A combination of both is often best. Treatment is usually arranged by a specialist, like a paediatrician or psychiatrist.\nTreatment of ADHD might include:\nMedication might help you or your child concentrate better, be less impulsive and feel calmer.&nbsp;\nYou might be offered therapy. This might be:\n- psychoeducation\n- behaviour therapy\n- parent training\n- education programmes\n- cognitive behavioural therapy\n- social skills training\nThe Scottish ADHD Coalition have information about local support groups in Scotland.\nProcrastintion Station are a Community Interest Company giving advice and support to adults with ADHD in Scotland."

It&#8217;s an imbalance of the usual bacteria found in the vagina.\nOften there are no symptoms of bacterial vaginosis. Some women may notice a change in the normal discharge from the vagina.\nThis discharge will usually be white or grey, thin or watery and have a strong, unpleasant fishy smell. This can be more noticeable during and after sex, and during periods.\nBacterial vaginosis does not usually cause itching or irritation.\nSometimes treatment is given based on symptoms without the need for an examination or test.\nSometimes a diagnosis can be made straightaway because of how the discharge looks. Sometimes the sample will be sent to a lab for testing.\nYou are more likely to need a test if you have frequent episodes of discharge.\nYour nurse or doctor may perform an internal examination to check your vagina for signs of bacterial vaginosis.

It&#8217;s not painful, but it may be a little uncomfortable for a moment.\nIf your nurse or doctor suspects you are at risk of an STI they may do more tests.\nBacterial vaginosis is treated with antibiotics. Antibiotics must be prescribed by a doctor or nurse. You may be given an antibiotic cream or gel to use in your vagina, instead of antibiotic tablets by mouth.\nWhile you&#8217;re there, make sure you tell the doctor or nurse if you:\n- are pregnant\n- think you might be pregnant\n- are breastfeeding\nThese may affect the type of treatment you&#8217;re given.\nYou can still have sex while being treated for bacterial vaginosis as it&#8217;s not sexually transmitted. However antibiotics and creams can affect condoms and other forms of contraception. Speak to your doctor or pharmacist who can give you further information.\nPartners do not usually need treatment.\nNon-antibiotic treatment is also available to buy in pharmacies.\nBacteria called lactobacilli naturally live in your vagina and stop other bacteria from growing there.\nSometimes the balance of these bacteria changes. If this happens you can develop bacterial vaginosis.\nBacterial vaginosis can’t be passed on. But it&#8217;s more common in sexually active people.\nOther things that may increase the risk of getting it include:\n- having a new sexual partner\n- having multiple sexual partners\n- smoking\n- using scented soaps or perfumed bubble bath\n- putting antiseptic liquids in the bath\n- douching (washing or cleaning out the vagina with water or other fluids)\n- using vaginal washes or deodorant\n- using strong detergents to wash your underwear\n- receiving oral sex\nThe causes of bacterial vaginosis are not fully understood, so it may not be possible to completely prevent it. However, you may be able to lower your risk of developing it by following our genital washing advice."

        "disease": "Benign prostate enlargement",
        "description": "Benign prostate enlargement (BPE), also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), is a condition that affects older men and anyone with a prostate.\nIt&#8217;s particularly common in men and anyone with a prostate over 50 years of age and isn&#8217;t usually a serious threat to health.\nThe prostate is a small gland, located in the pelvis, between the penis and bladder. It&#8217;s involved in the production of semen.\nThe prostate produces a thick, white fluid that&#8217;s made into a thinner&nbsp;liquid by a protein called prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The liquid is then mixed with sperm, produced by the testicles, to create semen.\nIf the prostate becomes enlarged, it can place pressure on the bladder and urethra (the tube through which urine passes). This can&nbsp;affect how you pass urine and may cause:\n- difficulty starting urination\n- a frequent need to urinate\n- difficulty fully emptying the bladder\nIn some men and anyone with a prostate, the symptoms are mild and don&#8217;t require treatment. In others, the symptoms can be very troublesome and have a major impact on a person&#8217;s quality of life.\nRead more about the&nbsp;symptoms of benign prostate enlargement\nMany people worry that having an enlarged prostate means they have an increased risk of developing prostate cancer.&nbsp;This isn&#8217;t the case. The risk of prostate cancer is no greater for people with an enlarged prostate than it is for those without an&nbsp;enlarged prostate.\nThe cause of prostate enlargement is unknown, but most experts agree that it&#8217;s linked to hormonal changes that occur as a man gets older.\nRead more about the causes of benign prostate enlargement\nIf your GP suspects that you have an enlarged prostate, you&#8217;ll be asked to complete a questionnaire to assess your symptoms.\nEach question has 5 possible answers that carry a score, and your overall score indicates the severity of your symptoms.\nYour GP will also want to rule out other conditions that cause similar symptoms to prostate enlargement.&nbsp;\nYou may have a number of standard tests, such as urine tests, plus some more specific tests, such as a&nbsp;blood test that measures PSA.\nRead more about diagnosing benign prostate enlargement\nTreatment for an enlarged prostate is determined by the severity of your symptoms.\nIf you have mild to moderate&nbsp;symptoms, you won&#8217;t receive any immediate medical treatment, but you&#8217;ll have regular check-ups to carefully monitor your prostate.\nYou&#8217;ll probably also be advised to make lifestyle changes, such as limiting your caffeine and alcohol intake, and exercising regularly, to see if they improve your symptoms.\nAs well as&nbsp;lifestyle changes, medication is usually recommended to treat moderate to severe symptoms of benign prostate enlargement.&nbsp;Finasteride and dutasteride are medications&nbsp;that are commonly used. They block the effects of a hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on the prostate gland, which can reduce the size of the prostate and improve associated symptoms.\nAlpha blockers may also be prescribed. They help to relax your bladder muscles, making it easier to pass urine. Tamsulosin and alfuzosin are two alpha blockers commonly used to treat benign prostate enlargement.\nSurgery is usually only recommended for moderate to severe symptoms of benign prostate enlargement that have failed to respond to medication.\nRead more about treating benign prostate enlargement\nBenign prostate enlargement can sometimes lead to complications such as a&nbsp;urinary tract infection (UTI) or acute urinary retention. Serious complications are rare.\nRead more about the complications of benign prostate enlargement\nBenign prostate enlargement is a condition associated with ageing and is common in men and anyone with a prostate over 50 years of age.\nThe symptoms of benign prostate enlargement are caused by the enlarged prostate placing pressure on the bladder and urethra (which carries urine from the bladder to the penis).\nThis can affect urination in a number of ways. For example, it can:\n- make it difficult for you to start urinating\n- weaken the flow of urine or cause &#8216;stopping and starting&#8217;\n- cause you to strain to pass urine\n- cause you to need to urinate&nbsp;frequently\n- cause you to wake up frequently during the night to urinate\n- cause a sudden urge to urinate, which can result in&nbsp;urinary incontinence if you can&#8217;t find a toilet quickly enough\n- cause you to not be able to empty your bladder fully\n- cause blood in the urine (haematuria)\nIn the later stages, benign prostate enlargement can cause urine retention and other complications such as&nbsp;bladder stones,&nbsp;bladder infections and kidney damage.\nSee&nbsp;your GP if you notice any problems with, or changes to,&nbsp;your usual pattern of urination. Even if the symptoms are mild, they could be caused by a condition that needs to be investigated.\nAny&nbsp;blood in the urine must be investigated by your GP to rule out other more serious conditions.\nThe exact cause of benign prostate enlargement is unknown, but research suggests that hormones probably play an important role in the condition&#8217;s development.\nHormones are powerful chemicals that can have a wide range of effects on the cells of the body.\nOne theory is that as some men and anyone with a prostate gets older, the levels of a type of hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT) increases, which may stimulate the growth of the prostate.\nAnother theory suggests that two hormones, testosterone and oestrogen, play a role. Younger men and anyone with a prostate produce high levels of testosterone and much smaller levels of oestrogen. But as they get older, levels of testosterone decrease, which means they then have a higher proportion of oestrogen in their body. It&#8217;s been suggested that the relative increase in oestrogen may stimulate prostate growth.\nResearch has shown that rates of benign prostate enlargement are higher among men and anyone with a prostate with high blood pressure and diabetes. However, both diabetes and high blood pressure are associated with the natural ageing process, so there may not be a direct connection between the three conditions.\nTo find out whether your prostate gland is enlarged, you&#8217;ll need to have a few tests.\nSome tests will be carried out by your GP and others will be carried out by a urologist (a doctor who specialises in urinary problems).\nFirst, your GP will ask about your symptoms. If it seems that you have symptoms of benign prostate enlargement, the next stage is to calculate your&nbsp;International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS).\nYou&#8217;ll be asked to complete a questionnaire to assess your symptoms. Each question has 5 possible answers that carry a score, and your overall score is used to assess the severity of your symptoms.\nThe checklist includes the following questions.\nOver the past month, how often:\n- have you had the sensation of not completely emptying your bladder after urinating?\n- have you had to urinate again less than 2 hours after finishing urinating?\n- have you found that you stopped and started again when urinating?\n- have you found it difficult to postpone urination?\n- have you had a weak stream of urine?\n- have you had to push or strain to begin urinating during the course of one night?\n- have you had to get up during the night to urinate?\nAfter your GP has assessed the severity your symptoms, they&#8217;ll aim to rule&nbsp;out other conditions&nbsp;with similar symptoms using certain tests.\nThe&nbsp;symptoms of benign prostate enlargement are similar to those of other conditions, including prostate cancer. Therefore, your GP will need to be completely sure that your symptoms aren&#8217;t caused by cancer.\nA urine test can be used to check whether your symptoms are caused by an infection in your urinary system, such as a&nbsp;kidney infection or bladder infection.\nYou may need&nbsp;a&nbsp;rectal examination to check whether you might have prostate cancer. Prostate cancer can cause the prostate gland to become hard and bumpy.\nYour GP will put on a glove and lubricate one of their fingers, before gently pushing this finger into your bottom and up into your rectum. As the rectum is close to the prostate gland, they&#8217;ll be able to check whether the surface of the gland has changed. The procedure will feel a little uncomfortable, but it isn&#8217;t usually painful.\nProstate cancer doesn&#8217;t always cause changes to the prostate gland, so you may need to have some more specialised tests to rule it out. You will probably be referred to a urologist for these tests.\nA blood test can be used to measure the amount of the PSA protein that&#8217;s produced by the prostate.\nA raised PSA level indicates enlargement of the prostate, and a significantly raised level may indicate prostate cancer. However, as with a rectal examination, a PSA test can&#8217;t provide a definitive diagnosis of prostate cancer.\nA TRUS is a type of ultrasound scan specifically designed to study the prostate and the surrounding area.\nAn ultrasound probe is placed into your rectum and uses soundwaves to build a detailed image of your prostate.\nThis type of scan measures the size of your prostate and can be used to either confirm or rule out a diagnosis of prostate cancer.\nA CT urogram is used to study the urinary tract (the bladder and the tubes through which urine passes, also known as the ureter and urethra).\nA CT urogram can be used to check for blockages in your urinary system that could be causing your symptoms, such as a&nbsp;kidney stone or bladder stone. It can also be used to detect any damage in the urinary tract.\nDuring a CT urogram, you’ll be injected with a harmless radioactive dye, which will be visible on X-rays. After 30-60 minutes, the dye should have passed into your urinary tract and a series of X-rays will be taken. In some cases, you may be asked to pass urine before the final X-ray is taken.\nA voiding chart is a urination diary, which you may be asked to keep for 24 hours. You&#8217;ll be asked to record how often you urinate, as well as details about how you urinate – for example, whether your urination is stopping and starting, or whether it&#8217;s difficult to start urinating.\nA voiding chart is a good way of finding out more information about your symptoms and can be used to determine the type of treatment that would be most effective in controlling your symptoms.\nUroflowmetry measures the pressure of your bladder and how well your bladder works when you urinate.\nYou&#8217;ll be given a&nbsp;local anaesthetic and a small flexible tube (catheter) will be inserted into your urethra and moved up into your bladder.\nWater will then be injected through the catheter and into your bladder. A computer connected to the catheter measures the pressure inside your bladder and can assess how well your bladder is working.\nAs with voiding charts, uroflowmetry is a good way of determining what type of treatment will help to control your symptoms.\nThe treatment for an enlarged prostate gland will depend on how severe your symptoms are.\nThe 3 main treatments are:\n- lifestyle changes\n- medication\n- surgery\nIf your symptoms are mild to moderate, you may not receive any immediate medical treatment, but you&#8217;ll have regular check-ups to carefully monitor your prostate gland. This is often referred to as &#8216;watchful waiting&#8217;.\nYou may also be advised to make lifestyle changes to see whether they improve your symptoms.\nIf your prostate gland is enlarged, you may be advised to:\n- avoid drinking any liquids for 1 to 2 hours before going to bed – this will reduce your chances of waking up during the night to pass urine (nocturia)\n- experiment with the time you take prescribed medication – for example, taking it&nbsp;at 7pm may help prevent nocturia\n- stop drinking alcohol and caffeine, or limit your consumption of them – these drinks can irritate your bladder and make your symptoms worse\n- exercise regularly&nbsp;– research shows moderate exercise, such as walking for 30 to 60 minutes a day, can improve symptoms, although it&#8217;s unclear exactly why this is the case&nbsp;\n- join a patient support group – your doctor should be able to recommend one, which&nbsp;may help you manage mild symptoms without the need for medication\nBladder training is an exercise programme that aims to increase the time between urination and the amount of urine your bladder can hold.\nYou&#8217;ll be given a target, such as waiting at least 2 hours between each time you urinate.\nIt&#8217;s a good idea to use a bladder training chart, which allows you to record each time you pass urine and the volume of urine passed&nbsp;– you&#8217;ll need a plastic jug to measure this. Your doctor should give you a chart to take home.\nYou&#8217;ll also be taught a number of exercises, such as breathing, relaxation and muscle exercises, to help take your mind off the need to urinate.\nOver time your target time will be increased, and at the end of the programme you should find that you&#8217;re able to go for longer without urinating.\nBladder training should only be carried out under medical supervision.\nMedication, in combination with the lifestyle changes above, is usually recommended to treat moderate to severe symptoms of benign prostate enlargement.\nFinasteride&nbsp;and&nbsp;dutasteride are widely used to treat benign prostate enlargement.\nThey block the effects of a hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on the prostate gland, which can reduce the size of the prostate and improve your associated symptoms.\nFind out about the&nbsp;causes of prostate enlargement\nIf you&#8217;re prescribed one of these medications, you may experience an immediate improvement in symptoms.\nHowever, you&#8217;ll need to take it for at least six months to get the maximum benefit, and your doctor will need to monitor you every year.\nUse condoms if you&#8217;re sexually active – both finasteride and dutasteride can have an adverse effect on your sperm. If you get a woman pregnant, there&#8217;s a risk the baby could develop birth defects.\nOther possible side effects can also&nbsp;include&nbsp;impotence and little or no&nbsp;sperm when you ejaculate.\nIn many cases, these side effects will improve as your body gets used to the medication. See your GP if the side effects are troubling you.\nAlpha blockers help relax the muscles of your bladder, making it easier to pass urine. You may be prescribed alpha blockers as your primary treatment or in combination with finasteride.\nTamsulosin and alfuzosin are 2 alpha blockers commonly used to treat benign prostate enlargement. Side effects of tamsulosin and alfuzosin are uncommon and usually mild.\nThey include:\n- dizziness&nbsp;\n- headaches&nbsp;\n- weakness\n- little or no sperm when you ejaculate\nYou should only begin taking alpha blockers over a restful weekend when you&#8217;re not planning to drive, as there&#8217;s a risk they could cause low blood pressure (hypotension) and fainting.\nGenerally, if you experience dizziness while taking this medication, avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until it&#8217;s passed.\nSurgery is usually only recommended for moderate to severe symptoms of benign prostate enlargement&nbsp;that have failed to respond to medication.\nVarious procedures can be used to reduce the pressure on your bladder.\nTransurethral resection of the prostate (TURP)&nbsp;involves inserting a small instrument called a resectoscope into your urethra, the&nbsp;tube that carries urine from the bladder to the penis.\nA wire loop heated by an electric current&nbsp;is used to remove excess tissue from your prostate.\nTURP is carried out using either a general anaesthetic, where you&#8217;re asleep, or a spinal anaesthetic, where you&#8217;re awake, but the lower half of your body is numbed.\nThe procedure can take up to an hour, depending on how much tissue needs to be removed. Most people are well enough to leave hospital 2 to 3 days after the operation.\nAfter&nbsp;surgery, you&#8217;ll be unable to urinate normally at first&nbsp;because of your swollen urethra.&nbsp;\nA thin tube called a&nbsp;catheter will be inserted into your urethra and up into your bladder to allow urine to drain away. This will usually be removed 24 to 48 hours after surgery.\nA common complication of TURP is you&#8217;ll no longer produce semen when you ejaculate. This is known as retrograde ejaculation.\nIt causes sperm to go into your bladder rather than out of your penis during ejaculation. However, you&#8217;ll still experience the physical pleasure associated with ejaculation (the climax).\nBladder neck incision&nbsp;involves widening the urethra so it is easier to pass urine. It is also known as&nbsp;transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP).\nLike TURP, the surgeon will insert a resectoscope into your urethra. The resectoscope has a heated wire loop at the end and is used to make small cuts (incisions) in the muscle where the prostate meets the bladder.\nThis type of surgery relaxes the opening to the bladder, helping urine flow out of it. As with TURP, TUIP&nbsp;is carried out under a spinal or general anaesthetic.\nAfter surgery, you may not be able to urinate and a catheter may be needed to empty your bladder. Like TURP, you&#8217;ll only need to use a catheter for a short time until you&#8217;re able to urinate normally.\nThere&#8217;s less of a risk of retrograde ejaculation with TUIP compared with TURP, although it can sometimes still occur.\nHolmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) is similar to a TURP. Excess prostate tissue is removed using an instrument inserted through the urethra. However, it uses&nbsp;a laser, rather than a wire loop.\nThere are some advantages to using this technique rather than a TURP, but also some disadvantages.\nIf you have been offered a HoLEP, you may want to ask your surgeon to explain why this was chosen for you, and the risks and benefits compared&nbsp;with TURP.\nThe insertion of prostatic urethral lift implants is a new surgical procedure that can help relieve urinary symptoms.\nThe procedure can be carried out under&nbsp;local anaesthesia or general anaesthesia.\nIt involves inserting tiny implants through the urethra.&nbsp;The implants are then positioned to hold the enlarged prostate away from the urethra so it isn&#8217;t blocked.\nOne of the big advantages&nbsp;of prostatic urethral lift implants compared with TURP&nbsp;and TUIP is a reduced risk to your sexual function&nbsp;– there is less chance of erectile dysfunction and ejaculation problems.\nThere&#8217;s also less tissue injury, which means your recovery will be quicker and you won&#8217;t need to stay in hospital as long.\nHowever, prostatic urethral lift implants&nbsp;are unlikely to provide permanent symptom relief in all cases. And as it&#8217;s a new procedure, the long-term outcomes are unknown and availability may be limited.\nRead more about the use of&nbsp;prostatic urethral lift implants&nbsp;to relieve symptoms of&nbsp;prostate&nbsp;enlargement.\nTransurethral vaporisation of the prostate (TUVP)&nbsp;is similar to a TURP, but parts of the prostate are destroyed (vaporised) rather than cut away.\nStudies have shown that TUVP is as effective as TURP at improving symptoms. But some men and anyone with a prostate may need more treatment in the future.\nA laser can sometimes be used to destroy the prostate tissue. This particular form of TUVP is called photoselective vaporisation of the prostate (PVP), or Greenlight laser surgery.\nA thin, flexible instrument called a cytoscope is inserted into the urethra. A laser fibre is then passed through the&nbsp;cytoscope to destroy the excess prostate tissue that is blocking the urine flow.\nThe procedure is recommended for those&nbsp;who don&#8217;t have a high risk of developing complications from treatment, such as men and anyone with a prostate who:\n- doesn&#8217;t have urinary retention\n- doesn&#8217;t have an increased risk of bleeding\n- has a prostate smaller than 100ml\nIn these &#8216;low-risk&#8217; groups, Greenlight laser surgery is thought to be as effective as TURP, but also has several benefits.\nThese include:\n- a shorter hospital stay&nbsp;– the procedure is often carried out as a day case\n- the catheter can be removed sooner&nbsp;\n- recovery is quicker\n- there&#8217;s a lower risk of complications\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) website has more information about GreenLight XPS for treating benign prostatic hyperplasia.\nAn open prostatectomy is a procedure that may be more effective than TURP if you have severe benign prostate enlargement.\nHowever, it&#8217;s now rarely used, even for larger prostates,&nbsp;because other techniques have been&nbsp;developed, such as HoLEP.\nDuring an open prostatectomy, an&nbsp;incision will be made in your tummy and the outer portion of your prostate will be removed.\nThe procedure carries a higher risk of complications, such as erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence. There&#8217;s also a greater chance that these complications will become permanent than if they occur after TURP.\nBenign prostate enlargement can sometimes lead to complications, such as a urinary tract infection or acute urinary retention.\nIf you&#8217;re unable to empty your bladder properly, there&#8217;s a risk that bacteria in your urinary system won&#8217;t get flushed out and will spread through the urine to cause a&nbsp;urinary tract infection (UTI).\nSymptoms of a UTI&nbsp;include:\n- cloudy, bloody or bad&#8211;smelling urine\n- pain in your lower abdomen (tummy)&nbsp;\n- nausea\n- vomiting\n- shaking and chills\n- a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above&nbsp;\nUTIs can be treated with antibiotics. A single UTI isn&#8217;t usually serious, but repeated UTIs can damage your kidneys and bladder. If you have a history of repeated UTIs, you may need to have surgery.\nAcute urinary retention (AUR) is the sudden inability to pass any urine. AUR should be treated as a medical emergency, because without prompt treatment urine may be passed back up into the kidneys, which can damage them.\nSymptoms of AUR include:\n- the sudden inability to pass urine\n- severe lower abdominal pain\n- swelling of the bladder that you can feel with your hands\nPhone 999 and ask for an ambulance if you or someone you know experiences the symptoms of AUR.\nAUR can be treated using a thin tube (catheter) to drain the urine out of your bladder. In very serious cases, surgery may be required to empty the bladder."

        "disease": "Bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma)",
        "description": "Bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma) is a rare but aggressive type of cancer.\nThe bile duct system, or &#8216;biliary&#8217; system, is made up of a series of tubes that begin in the liver and end in the small intestine. Bile is a fluid the digestive system uses to help break down fats and digest foods.\nIn most cases, there are no signs of bile duct cancer until it reaches the later stages, when symptoms can&nbsp;include:\n- jaundice&nbsp;– yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes, itchy skin, pale stools and dark-coloured urine&nbsp;\n- unintentional weight loss\n- abdominal pain\nSpeak to your GP if you have signs of jaundice or are worried about other symptoms. While it is unlikely you have bile duct cancer, it is best to get it checked.\nRead more about the symptoms of bile duct cancer\nThe exact cause of bile duct cancer is unknown. However, some things&nbsp;may increase your chances of developing the condition. The most common&nbsp;include being over 65 years old or having&nbsp;a&nbsp;rare chronic liver disease called primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).\nRead more about the causes of bile duct cancer\nThere are 2 main types of bile duct cancer,&nbsp;depending on where the cancer begins:\n- cancer that starts in a part of the bile duct inside the liver is known as intrahepatic bile duct cancer\n- cancer that starts in part of the bile duct outside the liver is known as extrahepatic bile duct cancer\nCancer of the bile duct can be difficult to diagnose, so you may need several tests, including:&nbsp;\n- blood tests\n- ultrasound scans\n- computerised tomography (CT) scans\n- magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans\nFor some of these tests, you&nbsp;may need to be injected with a special dye that highlights your bile ducts.\nYou may also&nbsp;need a&nbsp;biopsy. This involves removing a small sample of tissue so&nbsp;it can be studied under a microscope. However, in some cases, your surgeon may prefer to remove the suspected tumour based on the results of your scans alone.\nRead more about diagnosing bile duct cancer\nCancer of the bile duct&nbsp;can usually only be cured if cancerous cells haven&#8217;t spread. If this is the case, some or all of the bile duct&nbsp;may be removed.\nOnly a small proportion of bile duct cancer cases are diagnosed early enough to be suitable for surgery. This is&nbsp;because symptoms usually develop at a late stage.\nDespite this, treatment&nbsp;such as&nbsp;chemotherapy can relieve&nbsp;the symptoms of bile duct cancer and improve the quality of life of people in the advanced stages of the condition.\nRead more about&nbsp;treating bile duct cancer\nMost cases of bile duct cancer occur in people&nbsp;over the age of 65. The condition affects men and women almost equally.\nThere are no guaranteed ways to avoid getting bile duct cancer, but you can reduce your chances of developing it.\nThe&nbsp;most effective&nbsp;ways of&nbsp;achieving this are reducing your alcohol intake, as&nbsp;cirrhosis is a risk factor,&nbsp;and trying to ensure that you don&#8217;t become infected with&nbsp;hepatitis B or hepatitis C.\nRead more about preventing bile duct cancer\nBile duct cancer doesn&#8217;t usually cause any symptoms until the flow of bile from the liver is blocked.\nIn most cases, the condition is at an advanced stage by this time.\nThe blockage will cause bile to move back into the blood and body tissue, resulting in symptoms such as:\n- jaundice&nbsp;–&nbsp;yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, itchy skin, pale stools and dark-coloured urine\n- unintentional weight loss&nbsp;\n- abdominal pain – most people feel a dull ache in the upper right-hand side of their abdomen (stomach)\n- high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above and shivering\n- loss of appetite\nAlways visit your GP if you have jaundice. While jaundice is unlikely to be caused by bile duct cancer, it could indicate an underlying problem with the liver, such as hepatitis.\nThe exact cause of bile duct cancer is unknown, although some things can increase the risk of developing the condition.\nCancer&nbsp;begins with a change (mutation) in the structure of the DNA in cells, which can affect how they grow. This means that cells grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour.\nIf left untreated, cancer can grow and spread to other parts of your body, either directly or through the blood and lymphatic system.\nA&nbsp;number of&nbsp;factors that increase the risk of developing bile duct cancer have been identified.&nbsp;\nYour chances of developing cancer of the bile duct increase as you get older. Most people with the condition are over 65 years old.\nPrimary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare type of liver disease that causes&nbsp;long-lasting (chronic) inflammation of the liver.\nIt&nbsp;usually occurs in people&nbsp;aged 30&nbsp;to 50. Up to 10% of people with ulcerative colitis (inflammation of the colon and rectum) also have PSC.\nAround 10&nbsp;to 20% of people with PSC will develop bile duct cancer.&nbsp;Your risk of developing bile duct cancer is thought to be higher if you have PSC and you smoke.\nSome people can have fluid-filled sacs (cysts) in their bile duct.&nbsp;These cysts are usually congenital, which means&nbsp;they are present from&nbsp;birth.\nThe most common types are choledochal cysts and Caroli&#8217;s disease, but both conditions are very rare.\nUp to 20%&nbsp;of people with choledochal cysts that are not removed will develop cancer of the bile duct.\nBiliary stones are similar to gallstones, except they form inside the liver rather than inside the gallbladder.\nBiliary stones are rare in western Europe, but are relatively common in parts of Asia, such as Japan and Taiwan. It&#8217;s estimated that approximately 10% of people with biliary stones will develop bile duct cancer.\nLiver flukes are a type of parasitic insect known to increase the risk of developing bile duct cancer. You can become infected with liver flukes by eating undercooked fish that has been contaminated with fluke eggs.\nLiver fluke infections are usually only a problem in Asia (especially Thailand) and Africa, where liver flukes are more widespread.\nExposure to certain chemical toxins is known to increase the risk of developing bile duct cancer.\nFor example, if you are exposed to a chemical called thorotrast, your chances of developing bile duct cancer rises. Thorotrast was widely used in radiography until it was banned during the 1960s after its dangerous properties were fully understood.\nOther toxins that may increase your chances of developing cancer of the bile duct include:\n- asbestos –&nbsp;a fire-resistant material&nbsp;that was widely used in construction and manufacturing, but is now banned in this country\n- polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) –&nbsp;a chemical that was used in manufacturing and building but, like asbestos, has now been banned\nThe following factors&nbsp;are linked with an increased risk of developing bile duct cancer, but more research is still needed:\n- hepatitis B&nbsp;and hepatitis C\n- cirrhosis (a scarred liver) as a result of drinking excessive amounts of alcohol\n- HIV\n- diabetes\n- obesity\n- smoking\nBile duct cancer can be a challenging condition to diagnose. You usually need several different tests before an accurate diagnosis can be made.\nIn bile duct cancer, the cancerous cells may release certain&nbsp;chemicals that can be detected using blood tests. These are known as tumour markers.\nHowever, tumour markers can also be caused by other conditions.&nbsp;A positive blood test does not necessarily mean you have bile duct cancer, and a negative blood test does not always mean&nbsp;you don&#8217;t.\nA number of scans can be used to examine your bile ducts in more detail and check for lumps or other abnormalities that could be the result of cancer. These scans include:\n- ultrasound scan&nbsp;–&nbsp;high-frequency sound waves are used to build up a picture of the inside of your body\n- computer tomography (CT) scan –&nbsp;a series of X-rays of your liver are taken and a computer is used to assemble them into a more detailed three-dimensional image\n- magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan – this uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce a picture of the inside of your liver\nEndoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) allows your bile ducts show up more clearly on an X-ray scanner.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nA special dye is injected and the X-ray scanner is used to guide an endoscope (a small, flexible tube with a camera at the end) down your throat and into your bile duct. The endoscope can detect blockages in your bile duct&nbsp;that could be the result of bile duct cancer.\nA short wire-mesh tube, called a stent, may also be inserted into the artery during the procedure. The stent is left in place permanently to allow blood to flow more freely.\nAn advanced form of ERCP is a special test called a spyglass. This involves passing a specialised endoscope into the bile duct to detect abnormalities. It also enables a biopsy&nbsp;to be taken.\nWhile this test can help confirm bile duct cancer in uncertain cases, it is very expensive and requires specialist training. Therefore, it is only available at a limited number of centres.\nPercutaneous transhepatic cholangiography is carried out to obtain a detailed X-ray image of your bile duct.\nThe side of your abdomen (tummy)&nbsp;is numbed using&nbsp;local anaesthetic, and&nbsp;a special dye&nbsp;that shows up on X-rays is injected through your skin and into your liver duct.\nAs with ECRP, a stent may be inserted during the procedure. PTC and ECRP&nbsp;are both&nbsp;useful ways of detecting any blockages in your bile duct that could be caused by bile duct cancer.\nIf scans indicate&nbsp;that you may have bile duct cancer, a&nbsp;biopsy&nbsp;may be&nbsp;carried out to confirm a diagnosis.\nDuring&nbsp;a biopsy, a small sample of tissue is taken from the body and checked under a microscope for&nbsp;cancerous cells.\nA biopsy is usually performed while ERCP or PTC is being carried out. As well as taking bile and tissue samples from your bile duct, samples may be taken from nearby lymph nodes. This is to check whether the cancer has spread from your bile duct into your lymphatic system.\nA widely used method of staging bile duct cancer is a number staging system. The stages are:\n- stage 1A –&nbsp;the cancer is contained inside the bile duct\n- stage 1B – the cancer is beginning to spread beyond the walls of the bile duct, but has not spread into the surrounding tissue or lymph nodes\n- stage 2 – the cancer has spread into nearby tissue, such as the liver, but has not spread into the lymph nodes\n- stage 3 –&nbsp;the cancer has spread into the lymph nodes&nbsp;and&nbsp;major blood vessels that supply the liver\n- stage 4 –&nbsp;the cancer has spread into distant organs, such as the lungs\nRead more about staging bile duct cancer on the Cancer Research UK website\nIf you are diagnosed with cancer, the Alan Morement Memorial Fund (AMMF) is currently the only dedicated UK charity that provides support for people affected by bile duct cancer.\nMost cases of bile duct cancer cannot be cured. Instead, treatment is most commonly used to relieve symptoms.\nDue to the rarity of bile duct cancer, you are likely to be referred to a specialist hepatobiliary unit&nbsp;with experience in treating the condition.\nA multidisciplinary team (MDT) made up of different specialists&nbsp;will help you decide on your treatment, but the final decision will be yours. Your MDT&nbsp;may&nbsp;include:\n- a liver surgeon – a specialist in treating cancers of the liver\n- a medical or clinical oncologist – a specialist in the non-surgical treatment of cancer using techniques such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy\n- a pathologist – a specialist in diseased tissue\n- a radiologist – a specialist in&nbsp;radiological diagnosis and intervention&nbsp;\n- a cancer nurse&nbsp;– who usually acts as the first point of contact between you and the rest of the care team&nbsp;\n- a gastroenterologist – a specialist in the medical management of liver and biliary disease\nBefore going to hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may want to write a list of questions to ask the specialist. For example, you may want to find out the&nbsp;advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.\nYour recommended treatment plan will be determined by your general health and the&nbsp;stage the cancer has reached.\nIn cases of stage 1 and stage&nbsp;2 bile duct cancer, a cure may be possible by surgically removing the affected part of the bile duct, and possibly some of the liver or gallbladder.\nIn cases of stage 3 bile duct cancers, the chances of achieving a successful cure will depend on how many lymph nodes have been affected. A cure may be possible if only a few nodes have cancerous cells in them, or it may be possible to slow the spread of the cancer by surgically removing the lymph nodes.\nIn cases of stage&nbsp;4 bile duct cancer, achieving a successful cure is highly unlikely. However, stenting, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery can often be used to help relieve the symptoms.\nYour treatment plan may also be different if you have intrahepatic bile duct cancer, as this is usually treated in a similar way to liver cancer. Read more about treating liver cancer.\nA number of experimental treatments may be available as part of a clinical trial.\nIf your MDT thinks it is possible to cure your bile duct cancer, surgery will be needed to remove any cancerous tissue. Depending on the extent of the cancer, it may be necessary to remove:\n- the part of your bile duct that contains cancerous cells\n- your gallbladder\n- nearby lymph nodes\n- a large part&nbsp;of your liver\nAfter surgery, it is usually possible to reconstruct what remains of the bile duct so that bile can still&nbsp;flow into the intestine.\nSimilarly, it is often possible for the liver to resume normal function after surgery because we do not need all of our liver. The liver can also regenerate itself after surgery.\nYou may need to stay in hospital for up to two weeks or more after having bile duct cancer surgery before you are well enough to go home.\nSuccess rates of bile duct surgery depend on individual circumstances, such as whether nearby lymph nodes are free of cancer and whether it was possible to remove all of the cancerous cells during surgery.\nIf your bile duct becomes blocked as a result of cancer, treatment to unblock it may be recommended. This will help resolve symptoms such as:\n- jaundice –&nbsp;yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes\n- itchy skin\n- abdominal (tummy) pain\nUnblocking the bile duct is sometimes necessary if the flow of bile back into your liver starts to affect the normal functioning of your liver.\nThe bile duct can be unblocked by using a small tube called a stent.&nbsp;The stent widens the bile duct, which should help to get the bile flowing again.\nA stent can be inserted using either:\n- a&nbsp;variation of the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure, which uses an endoscope to guide the stent into the bile duct\n- a&nbsp;variation of the percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) procedure, which involves making a small incision (under local anaesthetic) in your abdominal wall\nOccasionally, an implanted stent can become blocked. If this occurs, it will need to be removed and replaced.\nRadiotherapy is not a standard treatment for bile duct cancer, but&nbsp;may help to relieve the symptoms, slow the spread of the cancer and prolong life. The types of radiotherapy are used to treat bile duct cancer:\n- external beam radiotherapy – a machine is used to target radioactive beams at your bile duct\n- internal radiotherapy (brachytherapy) – a radioactive wire is placed inside your bile duct next to the tumour\nRadiotherapy works by damaging the cancerous cells. However, it can also damage healthy cells and cause side effects. Side effects of radiotherapy include:\n- nausea (feeling sick)\n- vomiting\n- fatigue (severe tiredness)\nRead more about&nbsp;radiotherapy\nChemotherapy is used in a similar way to radiotherapy to relieve the symptoms of cancer, slow down the rate it spreads and prolong life. It is sometimes used in combination with radiotherapy.\nMedicines used in chemotherapy can sometimes damage healthy tissue as well as cancerous tissue, and adverse side effects are common. Side effects of chemotherapy can include:\n- nausea\n- vomiting\n- fatigue\n- hair loss\nHowever, these side effects should stop once the course of treatment has finished. Chemotherapy can also weaken your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection.\nRead more about chemotherapy\nThe treatments for bile duct cancer are not as effective as treatments for other types of cancer. Therefore, a number of clinical trials are being conducted to find better ways of treating the condition.\nFor example, ongoing trials are looking at new combinations of chemotherapy medicines, which may help&nbsp;extend the lifespan of someone with bile duct cancer.\nAnother promising field of research involves using targeted therapies to treat bile duct cancer. Targeted therapies are medications&nbsp;that target the processes that cancerous cells need to grow and reproduce.\nIn studies for some cancers, a medication called sorafenib has proved reasonably effective. Sorafenib works by blocking a protein that cancerous cells need to create a blood supply. However, sorafenib is not currently used as a routine treatment for bile duct cancer.\nAs bile duct cancer is a rare condition, there is a possibility you may be invited to take part in a clinical trial looking&nbsp;at the use of these types of experimental treatments.\nAll clinical trials are carried out under strict ethical guidelines based on the principles of patient care. However, there is no guarantee that the treatment you receive during a clinical trial will be more effective, or even as effective, as existing treatments.\nRead more about clinical trials&nbsp;\nThere are no guaranteed ways to avoid getting bile duct cancer, although it&nbsp;is possible to reduce your chances of developing the condition.\nThe 3 most effective steps to reduce your chances of developing bile duct cancer are:\n- giving up smoking (if you smoke)\n- drinking alcohol in moderation\n- minimising your exposure to the&nbsp;hepatitis B and&nbsp;hepatitis C viruses\nNot smoking&nbsp;is the most effective way of preventing bile duct cancer, as well as other serious health conditions, such as stroke, heart attack and lung cancer.\nIt is particularly important to&nbsp;stop smoking if you have the liver condition known as primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). If you have PSC, smoking will significantly increase your chances of developing bile duct cancer.\nYour GP can advise&nbsp;on how to give up smoking. They can&nbsp;also recommend and prescribe suitable medication. You can get more information and advice from the&nbsp;Quit Your Way Scotland&nbsp;advice and support service.\nRead more about&nbsp;stopping smoking\nIf you are a heavy drinker, reducing your alcohol intake will help prevent liver damage (cirrhosis). This may, in turn, reduce your risk of developing bile duct cancer.\nReducing your alcohol consumption is particularly important if you have a pre-existing liver condition, such as PSC or hepatitis B or C.\nRead low-risk drinking guidelines\nVisit your GP if you are finding it difficult to moderate your alcohol consumption. Counselling and medication are available to help reduce the amount you drink.\nRead more about alcohol\nIf you regularly inject drugs, the best way to avoid getting hepatitis C is to never share any of your drug-injecting equipment with others.\nYou should also avoid sharing any object that could be contaminated with blood, such as razors and toothbrushes.\nThere is less risk of getting hepatitis C by having sex with someone who is infected. However, as a precaution it is best to use a barrier method of contraception, such as a condom, with a new partner.\nRead more about&nbsp;preventing hepatitis C\nA vaccine is available that provides immunisation against&nbsp;hepatitis B.&nbsp;\nVaccination would usually only be recommended for people in high-risk groups, such as:\n- people who inject drugs or have a sexual partner who injects drugs\n- people who change their sexual partner frequently\n- people travelling to or from a part of the world where hepatitis B is widespread\n- healthcare workers who may have come into contact with the virus\nPregnant women are also screened for hepatitis B. If they are infected, their baby can be vaccinated shortly after birth to prevent them also becoming infected.\nRead more detailed information about hepatitis B vaccination\nThe liver fluke is a major cause of bile duct cancer in Asia. It is a parasite which, after infection, damages the tissue of the bile duct and in some cases triggers the onset of bile duct cancer.\nThe liver fluke is widespread in Thailand. Other countries where the liver fluke can be found include:\n- Cambodia\n- Laos\n- Vietnam\nInfection occurs after eating raw or undercooked fish contaminated by fluke eggs.\nAlways ensure any fish you eat is cooked thoroughly when travelling in these countries."

        "disease": "Binge eating",
        "description": "Binge eating disorder (BED) is a serious eating disorder. Someone with BED will regularly eat very large quantities of food over a short period of time without feeling like they&#8217;re in control of what they&#8217;re eating. This eating behaviour causes feelings of distress and guilt and being overwhelmed.\nIf you&#8217;re binge eating and then making yourself sick on a regular basis, this is more likely to be bulimia nervosa.\nBED can affect anyone of any age, gender, ethnicity or age.\nBinge eating disorder is more common than other eating disorders. In the UK around 1 in 25 people experience symptoms of binge eating disorder.\nThere&#8217;s no one way for someone with binge eating disorder to look.\nSigns that an episode of overeating is a binge, include:\n- eating much faster than normal\n- eating until you feel uncomfortably full\n- regularly eating a large amount of food when you’re not hungry\n- eating alone or secretly due to being embarrassed or ashamed about the amount of food you’re consuming\n- having feelings of guilt, shame or disgust during or after a binge\nThe main signs of BED are regularly:\n- eating a large quantity of food over a short time (bingeing)\n- feeling out of control of your eating and feeling distressed\n- restricting your eating or putting strict rules around eating\n- fasting for long periods of time before or after a binge\n- hoarding food\n- feeling ashamed and hiding evidence of eating from others – close family and friends may be unaware of the distress and binges\n- planning the day around food by trying to restrict how much food you eat and then fasting which may lead to more binges\n- having low self-esteem and feeling shame\n- being preoccupied about weight and body shape\nSpeak to your GP practice if you&#8217;re experiencing these symptoms and think you might have BED.\nIf you feel like you have to purge what you’ve eaten after a binge to avoid gaining weight, you may have symptoms of bulimia nervosa.\nIf binges don’t happen regularly, and your weight is very low, you may have symptoms of anorexia nervosa.\nThere are treatments available for BED. Treatment does not directly focus on weight loss. It focuses on addressing things like relationships, feelings and thoughts that result in a person having a difficult relationship with food.\nGuided self-help is where you work through information and activities on your own. You’ll also have regular support sessions with a professional.\nAnother treatment is cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), either individually or as part of a group. CBT starts with the idea that thoughts, feelings, and behaviour are linked and affect one another.\nIf problems in your life are causing you to binge eat, CBT helps you to reduce bingeing. It helps to identify the underlying issues so you’re less likely to binge in the future. It&#8217;ll focus on what&#8217;s keeping the eating disorder going rather than diet or weight loss.\nLearn more about talking therapies\nInterpersonal psychotherapy explores the link between relationships, feelings and eating behaviours.\nChildren and young people might be offered Family Based Treatment (FBT). This involves the whole family in solving their child or young person&#8217;s eating disorder. During FBT parents and carers are an essential part of the solution and members of the treatment team.\nMedication is not recommended to treat BED but may be prescribed to treat other health conditions you might have alongside BED.\nThe eating disorders SIGN guideline has more information about treatment for eating disorders.\nBinge eating often leads to weight gain. Being overweight or obese can put you at risk of a number of physical health problems, some of which can be life threatening.\nThese include:\n- high cholesterol\n- high blood pressure\n- diabetes\n- osteoarthritis\n- some types of cancer\nIf you think you might have a binge eating problem, help is available. You can get support to tackle both the physical and mental effects of binge eating.\nIf you have eating problems or think you may have an eating disorder, it’s important to seek help as soon as possible.\nYou could:\n- talk to someone you trust, like a friend or member of your family\n- see your GP – you may find it helpful to bring someone with you for support\n- contact an anonymous helpline like Beat&#8217;s helpline\nIf someone close to you is showing signs of an eating disorder, you can offer help and support.\nYou could try talking to them about how they feel and listening to what they say without judgement. You can encourage them to think about getting help. Try not to put pressure on them or be critical of them, as this could make things worse. You could also offer to help by going with the person to see their GP.\nYour GP or a healthcare professional can give you advice on how to help someone. This includes giving you information on:\n- the treatments available\n- how you can support them during their treatment\n- helping you understand BED\nRead more about how you can support someone with an eating disorder\nFind information and services that can offer advice and support about eating disorders"

        "disease": "Bipolar disorder",
        "description": "Bipolar disorder, formerly known as manic depression, is a condition that affects your moods, which can swing from one extreme to another.\nPeople with&nbsp;bipolar disorder have periods or episodes of:\n- depression – feeling very low and lethargic\n- mania – feeling very high and overactive (less severe mania is known as hypomania)\nSymptoms of bipolar disorder depend on which mood you&#8217;re experiencing. Unlike simple mood swings, each extreme episode of bipolar disorder can last for several weeks (or even longer), and some people may not experience a &#8220;normal&#8221; mood very often.\nYou may initially be diagnosed with&nbsp;clinical depression before having a future manic episode (sometimes years later), after which&nbsp;you may be&nbsp;diagnosed with&nbsp;bipolar disorder.\nDuring an episode of depression, you may have overwhelming feelings of worthlessness, which can potentially lead to thoughts of suicide.\nIf you&#8217;re feeling suicidal or having severe depressive symptoms, contact your GP, care co-ordinator or local mental health emergency services as soon as possible.\nIf you want to talk to someone confidentially, call the Samaritans, free of charge,&nbsp;on 116 123. You can talk to them&nbsp;24 hours a day,&nbsp;7 days a week. Alternatively, visit the Samaritans website.\nDuring a manic phase of bipolar disorder, you may feel very happy and have lots of energy, ambitious plans and ideas. You may spend large amounts of money on things you can&#8217;t afford and wouldn&#8217;t normally want.\nNot feeling like eating or sleeping, talking quickly and becoming annoyed easily are also common characteristics of this phase.\nYou may feel very creative and view the manic phase of bipolar as a positive experience. However, you may also experience symptoms of&nbsp;psychosis, where you see or hear things that aren&#8217;t there or become convinced of things that aren&#8217;t true.\nThe high and low phases of bipolar disorder are often so extreme that they interfere with everyday life.\nHowever, there are several options for&nbsp;treating bipolar disorder that can make a difference. They aim to control the effects of an episode and help someone with bipolar disorder live life as normally as possible.\nThe following treatment options are available:\n- medication to prevent episodes of mania, hypomania (less severe mania) and depression&nbsp;–&nbsp;these are known as mood stabilisers and are taken every day on a long-term basis\n- medication to treat the main symptoms of depression and mania when they occur\n- learning to recognise the triggers and signs of an episode of depression or mania\n- psychological treatment&nbsp;–&nbsp;such as talking therapy, which can help you deal with depression, and provides advice about how to improve your relationships\n- lifestyle advice&nbsp;–&nbsp;such as doing regular exercise, planning activities you enjoy that give you a sense of achievement, as well as advice on&nbsp;improving your diet and getting more sleep\nIt&#8217;s thought using a combination of different treatment methods is the best way to control bipolar disorder.\nHelp and advice for people with a long-term condition or their carers&nbsp;is also available&nbsp;from charities, support groups and associations.\nThis includes self-help and self-management advice, and learning to&nbsp;deal with the practical aspects of a long-term condition.\nFind out more about living with bipolar disorder\nBipolar disorder, like all other mental health problems, can get worse during pregnancy. However, specialist help is available if you need it.\nThe exact&nbsp;cause of bipolar disorder&nbsp;is unknown, although it&#8217;s believed a number of things can trigger an episode. Extreme stress, overwhelming problems and life-changing events are thought to contribute, as well as genetic and chemical factors.\nBipolar disorder is fairly common and one in every 100 adults will be diagnosed with the condition at some point in their life.\nBipolar disorder can occur at any age, although it often develops between the ages of 15 and 19 and rarely develops after 40. Men and women from all backgrounds are equally likely to&nbsp;develop bipolar disorder.\nThe pattern of mood swings in bipolar disorder varies widely between people. For example, some people only have a couple of bipolar episodes in their lifetime and&nbsp;are stable in between, while others have many episodes.\nBipolar disorder is characterised by extreme mood swings. These can range from extreme highs (mania) to extreme lows (depression).\nEpisodes of mania and depression often last for several weeks or months.\nDuring a period of depression, your symptoms may include:\n- feeling sad, hopeless or irritable most of the time\n- lacking energy\n- difficulty concentrating and remembering things\n- loss of interest in everyday activities\n- feelings of emptiness or worthlessness\n- feelings of guilt and despair\n- feeling pessimistic about everything\n- self-doubt\n- being delusional, having hallucinations and disturbed or illogical thinking\n- lack of appetite\n- difficulty sleeping\n- waking up early\n- suicidal thoughts\nThe manic phase of bipolar disorder may include:\n- feeling very happy, elated or overjoyed\n- talking very quickly\n- feeling full of energy\n- feeling self-important\n- feeling full of great new ideas and having important plans\n- being easily distracted\n- being easily irritated or agitated\n- being delusional, having hallucinations and disturbed or illogical thinking\n- not feeling like sleeping\n- not eating\n- doing things that often have disastrous consequences –&nbsp;such as spending large sums of money on expensive and sometimes unaffordable items\n- making decisions or saying things that are out of character and that others see as being risky or harmful\nIf you have bipolar disorder, you may have episodes of depression more regularly than episodes of mania, or vice versa.\nBetween episodes of depression and mania, you may sometimes have periods where you have a &#8220;normal&#8221; mood.\nThe patterns aren&#8217;t always the same and some people may experience:\n- rapid cycling&nbsp;–&nbsp;where a person with bipolar disorder repeatedly swings from a high to low phase quickly without having a &#8220;normal&#8221; period in between\n- mixed state&nbsp;–&nbsp;where a person with bipolar disorder experiences symptoms of&nbsp;depression and mania together; for example, overactivity with a depressed mood\nIf your mood swings last a long time but aren&#8217;t severe enough to be classed as bipolar disorder, you may be diagnosed with cyclothymia&nbsp;(a mild form of bipolar disorder).\nBipolar disorder is a condition of extremes.&nbsp;A person with the condition may be unaware they&#8217;re in the manic phase.\nAfter the episode is over, they may be shocked at their behaviour. However, at the time, they may believe other people&nbsp;are being negative or unhelpful.\nSome people with bipolar disorder have more frequent and severe episodes than others.&nbsp;The extreme nature of the condition means&nbsp;staying in a job may be difficult and relationships may become strained. There&#8217;s also an increased risk of suicide.\nDuring episodes of mania and depression, someone with bipolar disorder may experience strange sensations, such as seeing, hearing or smelling things that aren&#8217;t there (hallucinations).\nThey may also believe things that seem irrational to other people (delusions). These types of symptoms are known as&nbsp;psychosis or a psychotic episode.\nRead more about&nbsp;living with bipolar disorder\nThe exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown. Experts believe there are a number of factors that work together to make a person more likely to develop the condition.\nThese are thought to be a complex mix of physical, environmental and social factors.\nBipolar disorder is widely believed to be the result of chemical imbalances in the brain.\nThe chemicals responsible for controlling the brain&#8217;s functions are called neurotransmitters and include&nbsp;noradrenaline, serotonin and dopamine.\nThere&#8217;s some evidence that if there&#8217;s an imbalance in the levels of one or more neurotransmitters, a person may develop some&nbsp;symptoms of bipolar disorder.\nFor example, there&#8217;s evidence that episodes of mania may occur when levels of noradrenaline are too high, and episodes of depression may be the result of noradrenaline levels becoming too low.\nIt&#8217;s also thought bipolar disorder is linked to genetics, as the condition seems to run in families. The family members of a person with the condition have an increased risk of developing it themselves.\nHowever, no single gene is responsible for bipolar disorder. Instead, a number of genetic and environmental factors are thought to act as triggers.\nA stressful circumstance or situation often triggers the symptoms of bipolar disorder. Examples of stressful triggers include:\n- the breakdown of a relationship\n- physical, sexual or emotional abuse\n- the death of a close family member or loved one\nThese types of life-altering events can cause episodes of depression at any time in a person&#8217;s life.\nBipolar disorder may also be triggered by:\n- physical illness\n- sleep disturbances\n- overwhelming problems in everyday life –&nbsp;such as problems with money, work or relationships\nIf your GP thinks you may have bipolar disorder, they&#8217;ll usually refer you to a psychiatrist (a medically qualified mental health specialist).\nIf your illness puts you at risk of harming yourself, your GP will arrange an appointment immediately.\nYou&#8217;ll be assessed by the psychiatrist at your appointment. They&#8217;ll ask you a few questions to determine if you have bipolar disorder.&nbsp;If you do, they&#8217;ll decide what treatments are most suitable.\nDuring the assessment, you&#8217;ll be asked about your symptoms and when you first experienced them. The psychiatrist will also ask about how you feel leading up to and during an episode of mania or depression, and if you have thoughts about harming yourself.\nThe psychiatrist will also want to know about your medical background and family history, especially whether any of your relatives have had bipolar disorder.\nIf someone else in your family has the condition, the psychiatrist may want to talk to them. However, they&#8217;ll ask for your agreement before doing so.\nDepending on your symptoms, you may also need tests to see whether you have a physical problem, such as an&nbsp;underactive thyroid or an overactive thyroid.\nIf you have bipolar disorder, you&#8217;ll need to visit your GP regularly for a physical health check.\nTreatment for bipolar disorder aims to reduce the severity and number of episodes of depression and mania to allow as normal a life as possible.\nTreatment for bipolar disorder aims to reduce the length and severity of episodes. In some cases treatment can prevent bipolar episodes.\nMost people with bipolar disorder can be treated using a combination of different treatments. These can include one or more of the following:\n- medication to prevent episodes of mania, hypomania (less severe mania) and depression – these are known as mood stabilisers and are taken every day on a long-term basis\n- medication to treat the main symptoms of depression and mania when they occur\n- learning to recognise the triggers and signs of an episode of depression or mania\n- psychological treatment – like talking therapies, which help you deal with depression and provide advice on how to improve relationships\n- lifestyle advice – such as doing regular exercise, planning activities you enjoy that give you a sense of achievement, and advice on improving your diet and getting more sleep\nRead more about living with bipolar disorder.\nSeveral medications are available to help stabilise mood swings. These are commonly referred to as mood stabilisers and include:\n- lithium carbonate\n- anticonvulsant medicines\n- antipsychotic medicines\nIf you’re already taking medication for bipolar disorder and you develop depression, you should speak to your healthcare professional.\nIf you have bipolar disorder, you can learn to recognise the warning signs of an approaching episode of mania or depression.\nA community mental health worker, such as a psychiatric nurse, may be able to help you identify your early signs of relapse from your history.\nThis may mean making some changes to your treatment. Your healthcare professional can advise you on this.\nMost people find psychological treatment helpful when used alongside medication in between episodes of mania or depression.\nYou should speak to your healthcare professional if you have bipolar disorder if you&#8217;re trying to conceive or become pregnant.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that specialist mental health services work closely with maternity services.\nA written plan for managing the treatment of a pregnant woman with bipolar disorder should be developed as soon as possible.\nThe plan should be drawn up with the patient, her partner, her obstetrician (pregnancy specialist), midwife, GP and health visitor.\nIf you become pregnant while taking medication prescribed to treat bipolar disorder, it’s important that you don’t stop taking it until you’ve discussed it with your healthcare professional.\nIf medication is prescribed for bipolar disorder after the baby is born, it may also affect a mother’s decision to breastfeed her child. Your pharmacist, midwife or mental health team can give you advice based on your circumstances.\nAlthough it&#8217;s usually a long-term condition, effective treatments for bipolar disorder, combined with self-help techniques, can limit the condition&#8217;s impact on your everyday life.\nEating well and keeping fit&nbsp;are important for everyone.&nbsp;Exercise can also help reduce the symptoms of bipolar disorder, particularly depressive symptoms.\nIt may also give you something to&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;and provide a&nbsp;routine, which is important for many people.\nA healthy diet, combined with exercise, may also help limit weight gain, which is a common side effect of medical treatments for bipolar disorder.\nSome treatments also&nbsp;increase the risk of developing diabetes, or worsen the illness in people that already have it. Maintaining a healthy weight and exercising are an important way of limiting that risk.\nYou should have a check-up at least once a year to monitor your risk of developing cardiovascular disease or diabetes.\nThis will include recording your weight, checking your blood pressure and having any appropriate blood tests.\nRead more information about&nbsp;losing weight and improving fitness\nSelf-care is an essential part of daily life.&nbsp;It involves taking responsibility for your own health and wellbeing with support from the people involved in your care.\nIt includes:\n- staying fit and maintaining good physical and mental health\n- preventing illness or accidents\n- caring more effectively for minor ailments and long-term conditions\nPeople with&nbsp;long-term conditions can benefit enormously from being helped&nbsp;with self-care.&nbsp;They can live longer, have less pain, anxiety, depression and fatigue, have a better quality of life, and be more active and independent.\nSelf-management programmes aim to help people with bipolar disorder take an active part in their own recovery so they&#8217;re not controlled by their condition.\nOne course run by&nbsp;Bipolar&nbsp;UK aims to teach people with bipolar disorder how to manage their illness. The programme includes information about:\n- triggers and warning signs\n- coping strategies and self-medication\n- support networks and action plans\n- maintaining a healthy lifestyle\n- drawing up an advance decision\n- complementary therapies\n- action plans\nCourses&nbsp;such as&nbsp;these help people who may feel distressed and uncertain about their bipolar disorder improve their own lives.\nSome people with bipolar disorder find it easy to talk to family and friends about their condition and its effects. Other people find it easier to turn to charities and support groups.\nMany organisations run self-help groups that can put you in touch with other people with the condition. This enables people to share helpful ideas and helps them&nbsp;realise they&#8217;re not alone in feeling the way they do. These organisations also provide online support in forums and blogs.\nSome useful charities, support groups and associations include:\n- Bipolar UK\n- Carers UK\n- Mind&nbsp;\n- Rethink&nbsp;\n- Samaritans\n- SANE&nbsp;\nTalking therapies&nbsp;are useful for managing bipolar disorder, particularly during periods of stability.\nYou may be involved with many different services during treatment for bipolar disorder. Some are accessed through referral from your GP, others through your local authority.\nThese services may include:\n- Community mental health teams (CMHT) – these provide the main part of local specialist mental health services. They offer assessment, treatment and social care to people with&nbsp;bipolar disorder&nbsp;and other mental illnesses.\n- Early intervention teams&nbsp;– these provide early identification and treatment for people who have the first symptoms of psychosis. Your GP may be able to refer you directly to an early intervention team.\n- Crisis services – these allow people to be treated at home, instead of in hospital, for an acute episode. These are specialist mental health teams that deal with crises that occur outside normal office hours.\n- Acute day hospital – these are an alternative to inpatient care in a hospital. You can visit every day or as often as you need.\n- Assertive outreach teams – these deliver intensive treatment and rehabilitation in the community for people with severe mental health problems, providing rapid help in a crisis. Staff often visit people at home and liaise with other services, such as your GP or social services. They can also help with practical problems, such as helping to find housing and work, or doing your shopping and cooking.\nSome people with bipolar disorder use alcohol or illegal drugs to try to take away their pain and distress. Both have well-known harmful physical and social effects and are not a substitute for effective treatment and good healthcare.\nSome people with bipolar disorder find they can stop misusing alcohol and drugs&nbsp;once they&#8217;re using effective treatment.\nOthers may have separate but related problems of alcohol and drug abuse, which may need to be treated separately.\nAvoiding alcohol and illegal drugs is an important part of recovery from episodes of manic, hypomanic or depressive symptoms, and can help you gain stability.\nRead more about&nbsp;alcohol misuse\nIt&#8217;s important to avoid too much stress,&nbsp;including work-related stress. If you&#8217;re employed, you may be able to work shorter hours or in a more flexible way, particularly if job pressure triggers your symptoms.\nUnder the Equality Act 2010, people are protected from discrimination in the workplace and in wider society.

        "disease": "Bladder cancer",
        "description": "Bladder cancer is where a growth of abnormal tissue, known as a tumour, develops in the bladder lining. In some cases, the tumour spreads into the surrounding muscles.\nThe most common symptom of bladder cancer is blood in your urine, which is usually painless.\nIf you notice blood in your urine, even if it comes and goes, you should speak to your GP, so the cause can be investigated.\nRead about the symptoms of bladder cancer\nOnce diagnosed, bladder cancer can be classified by how far it has&nbsp;spread.&nbsp;\nIf the cancerous cells are contained inside the lining of the bladder, doctors describe it as non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.&nbsp;This is the most common type of bladder cancer, accounting for 7 out of 10 cases.&nbsp;Most people don&#8217;t die as a result&nbsp;of&nbsp;this type of bladder cancer.\nWhen the cancerous cells spread beyond the lining, into the surrounding muscles of the bladder, it&#8217;s referred to as muscle-invasive bladder cancer.&nbsp;This is less common,&nbsp;but has a higher chance&nbsp;of spreading to other parts of the body and can be fatal.\nIf bladder cancer has spread to other parts of the body, it&#8217;s known as locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer.\nRead more about diagnosing bladder cancer\nMost cases of bladder cancer appear to be caused by exposure to harmful substances, which lead to abnormal changes in the bladder&#8217;s cells over many years.\nTobacco smoke is a common cause and&nbsp;it&#8217;s estimated that half of all cases of bladder cancer are caused by smoking.\nContact with certain chemicals previously&nbsp;used in manufacturing is also known to cause bladder cancer. However, these substances have since&nbsp;been banned.\nRead more about the causes of bladder cancer&nbsp;and preventing bladder cancer\nIn cases of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, it&#8217;s usually possible to remove the cancerous cells while leaving the rest of the bladder intact.\nThis is done using a surgical technique called transurethral resection of a bladder tumour (TURBT).&nbsp;This&nbsp;is followed by a dose of chemotherapy medication directly into the bladder, to reduce the risk of the cancer returning.\nIn cases with a higher risk of recurrence, a medication known as Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) may be injected into the bladder to reduce the risk of the cancer returning.\nTreatment for high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, or muscle-invasive bladder cancer may involve surgically removing the bladder in an operation known as a cystectomy.\nWhen the bladder is removed, you&#8217;ll need another way of&nbsp;collecting your urine. Possible options include making an opening in the abdomen so urine can be passed into an external&nbsp;bag, or constructing a new bladder out of a section of bowel. This will be done at the same time as a cystectomy.\nIf it&#8217;s possible to avoid removing the bladder, or if surgery&nbsp;is not suitable, a course of radiotherapy&nbsp;and&nbsp;chemotherapy may be recommended. Chemotherapy may sometimes be used on its own before surgery or before being combined with radiotherapy.\nAfter treatment for all types of bladder cancer, you&#8217;ll have regular follow-up tests to check for signs of recurrence.\nRead more about treating bladder cancer\nBladder cancer&nbsp;is more common in older adults, with more than half of all new&nbsp;cases diagnosed in people&nbsp;aged 75 and over.\nBladder cancer is also more common in men than in women, possibly because in the past, men were more likely to smoke and work in the&nbsp;manufacturing industry.\nBlood in your urine is the most common symptom of bladder cancer.\nThe medical name for this is haematuria&nbsp;and it&#8217;s usually painless. You may notice streaks of blood in your urine or the blood may turn your urine brown. The blood isn&#8217;t always noticeable and it may come and go.\nLess common symptoms of bladder cancer include:\n- a need to urinate on a more frequent basis\n- sudden urges to urinate\n- a burning sensation when passing urine\nIf bladder cancer reaches an advanced stage and begins to spread, symptoms can include:\n- pelvic pain&nbsp;\n- bone pain\n- unintentional weight loss&nbsp;\n- swelling of the legs\nIf you ever have blood in your urine&nbsp;– even if it comes and goes&nbsp;– you should speak to your GP, so the cause can be investigated.\nHaving blood in your urine doesn&#8217;t mean you definitely have bladder cancer. There are other, more common, causes including:\n- a&nbsp;urinary tract infection,&nbsp;such as cystitis\n- a kidney infection\n- kidney stones\n- urethritis\n- an enlarged prostate gland,&nbsp;in men\nBladder cancer is caused by changes to the cells of the bladder. It&#8217;s often linked with exposure to certain chemicals, but the cause isn&#8217;t always known.\nCancer begins with a change (mutation)&nbsp;in the structure of the DNA in cells, which&nbsp;can&nbsp;affect how they grow. This means that cells grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour.\nSeveral&nbsp;factors&nbsp;have been identified that can significantly increase your risk of developing bladder cancer.\nSmoking is the single biggest risk factor for bladder cancer. This is because tobacco contains cancer-causing (carcinogenic) chemicals.\nIf you smoke for many years, these chemicals pass into your bloodstream and are filtered by the kidneys&nbsp;into your urine. The bladder is repeatedly exposed to these harmful chemicals, as it acts as a store for urine. This can cause changes to the cells of the bladder lining, which may&nbsp;lead to bladder cancer.\nIt&#8217;s estimated that&nbsp;just over a third&nbsp;of all cases of bladder cancer are caused by&nbsp;smoking. People who smoke may be up to&nbsp;four times more likely to develop bladder cancer than non-smokers.\nExposure to certain industrial chemicals is the second biggest risk factor. Previous studies have estimated that this may account for around 25% of cases.\nChemicals known to increase the risk of bladder cancer include:\n- aniline dyes\n- 2-Naphthylamine\n- 4-Aminobiphenyl\n- xenylamine\n- benzidine\n- o-toluidine\nOccupations&nbsp;linked to an increased risk of bladder cancer are manufacturing jobs involving:\n- dyes\n- textiles\n- rubbers\n- paints\n- plastics\n- leather tanning\nSome non-manufacturing jobs have also been linked to an increased risk of bladder cancer. These include taxi or bus drivers, as a result of their regular exposure to the chemicals present in diesel fumes.\nThe link between bladder cancer and these types of occupations was discovered in the 1950s and 1960s. Since then, regulations relating to exposure to cancer-causing chemicals have been made much more rigorous and many of the chemicals listed above&nbsp;have been banned.\nHowever,&nbsp;these chemicals are still&nbsp;linked with cases of bladder cancer now, as it can take up to&nbsp;30 years after initial exposure to the chemicals before the condition starts to develop.\nOther&nbsp;factors that can increase your risk of bladder cancer include:\n- radiotherapy to treat previous cancers near the bladder, such as&nbsp;bowel cancer\n- previous treatment with&nbsp;certain chemotherapy medications, such as&nbsp;cyclophosphamide and cisplatin\n- previous surgery to remove part of the prostate gland, during treatment for&nbsp;benign prostate enlargement\n- having diabetes – bladder cancer is thought to be linked to certain treatments for type 2 diabetes\n- having a tube in your bladder (an indwelling catheter) for a long time, because you have nerve damage that has resulted in paralysis\n- long-term or repeated&nbsp;urinary tract infections (UTIs)\n- long-term bladder stones\n- having an early&nbsp;menopause (before the age of 42)\n- an untreated infection called schistosomiasis, which is caused by a parasite that lives in fresh water – this is very rare in the UK\nBladder cancer usually begins in the cells of the bladder lining. In some cases, it&nbsp;may spread into surrounding bladder muscle. If the cancer penetrates this muscle, it&nbsp;can spread to other parts of the body, usually through the lymphatic system.\nIf bladder cancer spreads to other parts of the body, such as other organs, it&#8217;s known as metastatic bladder cancer.\nIf you have symptoms of bladder cancer, such as blood in your urine, you should speak to your GP.\nYour GP may ask about your&nbsp;symptoms,&nbsp;family history and whether you&#8217;ve been exposed to any possible causes of bladder cancer,&nbsp;such as&nbsp;smoking.\nIn some cases, your GP may request a urine sample, so&nbsp;it can be tested in a laboratory for traces of blood, bacteria or abnormal cells.\nYour GP&nbsp;may also carry out a physical examination of your rectum and vagina,&nbsp;as bladder cancer&nbsp;sometimes causes a noticeable lump that presses against them.\nIf your doctor suspects&nbsp;bladder cancer,&nbsp;you&#8217;ll be&nbsp;referred to a hospital for further tests.\nIn 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of bladder cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. Find out who should be referred for further tests for suspected bladder cancer.\nSome hospitals have&nbsp;specialist clinics for people with&nbsp;blood in their urine (haematuria), while others have specialist urology departments for people with urinary tract problems.\nIf you&#8217;re referred to a hospital specialist and they think you might have bladder cancer, you should first be offered a cystoscopy.\nThis procedure allows the specialist to examine the inside of your bladder by passing a cystoscope through your urethra (the tube through which you urinate).&nbsp;A cystoscope is&nbsp;a&nbsp;thin tube with a camera and light at the end.\nBefore having a cystoscopy,&nbsp;a&nbsp;local anaesthetic&nbsp;gel is applied to your urethra (the tube through which you urinate) so&nbsp;you don&#8217;t feel any pain.&nbsp;The gel also&nbsp;helps the cystoscope to pass into the urethra more easily.\nThe procedure usually takes about 5 minutes.\nYou may be offered a&nbsp;CT scan&nbsp;or an&nbsp;MRI scan if the specialist feels they need a more detailed picture of your bladder.\nAn intravenous (IV) urogram may also be used to look at your whole urinary system before or after treatment for bladder cancer.\nDuring this procedure, dye is injected into your bloodstream and X-rays are used to study it as it passes through your urinary system.\nIf abnormalities are found in your bladder during a cystoscopy, you should be offered an operation known as TURBT. This is&nbsp;so any abnormal areas of tissue&nbsp;can be removed and tested for cancer (a biopsy).\nTURBT&nbsp;is carried out under&nbsp;general anaesthetic.\nSometimes, a sample of the muscle wall of your bladder is also taken to check whether the cancer has spread, but this may be a separate operation within 6 weeks of the first&nbsp;biopsy.\nYou should also be offered a dose of&nbsp;chemotherapy after the operation. This may help to prevent the bladder cancer returning if the removed cells are found to be cancerous.\nSee&nbsp;treating bladder cancer for more information about the TURBT procedure\nOnce these tests have been completed, it should be possible to tell you the grade of the cancer and what stage it is.\nStaging is a measurement of how far the cancer has spread. Lower-stage cancers are smaller and have a better chance of successful treatment.\nGrading is a measurement of how likely a cancer is to spread.&nbsp;The grade of a cancer is usually described using a number system ranging from G1 to G3. High-grade cancers are more likely to spread than low-grade cancers.&nbsp;\nThe most widely used staging system for bladder cancer is known as the TNM system, where:\n- T stands for how&nbsp;far into the bladder the tumour has grown\n- N stands for whether the cancer has spread into nearby lymph nodes\n- M stands for whether the cancer has spread into another part of the body (metastasis), such as the lungs\nThe T staging system is as follows:\n- TIS or CIS (carcinoma in situ) – a very early high-grade cancer confined to the innermost layer of the bladder lining\n- Ta – the cancer is just in the innermost layer of the bladder lining\n- T1 – the cancerous cells have started to grow into the connective tissue beyond the bladder lining\nBladder cancer up to the T1 stage is usually called early bladder cancer or non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.\nIf the tumour grows larger than this, it&#8217;s usually called muscle-invasive bladder cancer and is categorised as:\n- T2 – the cancer has grown through the connective tissue, into the bladder muscle\n- T3 – the cancer has grown through the layer of muscles, into the surrounding layer of fat\nIf the tumour grows larger than the T3 stage, it&#8217;s considered to be advanced bladder cancer and is categorised as:\n- T4 – the cancer has spread outside the bladder, into surrounding organs\nThe N staging system is as follows:\n- N0 – there are no cancerous cells in any of your lymph nodes\n- N1 – there are cancerous cells in just one of your lymph nodes in your pelvis\n- N2 – there are cancerous cells in two or more lymph nodes in your pelvis\n- N3 – there are cancerous cells in one or more of your lymph nodes (known as common iliac nodes) deep in your groin\nThere are only two options in the M system:\n- M0 – where the cancer hasn&#8217;t spread to another part of the body\n- M1 – where the cancer has spread to another part of the body, such as the bones, lungs or liver\nThe TNM system can be difficult to understand, so don&#8217;t be afraid to ask your care team questions about your test results and what they mean for your treatment and outlook.\nThe treatment options for bladder cancer largely depend on how advanced the cancer is.\nTreatments usually differ&nbsp;between early stage, non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer and more advanced muscle-invasive bladder cancer.\nAll hospitals use MDTs to treat bladder cancer. These are teams of specialists that work together to make decisions about the best way to proceed with your treatment.\nMembers of your MDT may include:\n- a urologist&nbsp;– a surgeon specialising in treating conditions affecting the urinary tract\n- a clinical oncologist&nbsp;– a specialist in chemotherapy and radiotherapy\n- a pathologist&nbsp;–&nbsp;a specialist in diseased tissue\n- a radiologist&nbsp;– a specialist in detecting disease using imaging techniques\nYou should be given the contact details for a clinical nurse specialist, who will be in contact with all members of your MDT.&nbsp;They&#8217;ll be able to answer questions and support you throughout your treatment.\nDeciding what treatment is best for you can be difficult. Your MDT will make recommendations, but remember that the final decision is yours.&nbsp;\nBefore discussing your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions to ask your MDT.\nIf you&#8217;ve been diagnosed with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (stages CIS, Ta and T1), your recommended treatment plan depends on the risk of the cancer returning or spreading beyond the lining of your bladder.\nThis risk is calculated using a series of factors, including:\n- the number of tumours present in your bladder\n- whether the tumours are larger than 3cm (1 inch) in diameter\n- whether you&#8217;ve had bladder cancer before\n- the grade of the cancer cells\nThese treatments are discussed in more detail below.\nLow-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer is treated with transurethral resection of a bladder tumour (TURBT). This procedure may be performed during your first cystoscopy when tissue samples are taken for testing (see diagnosing bladder cancer).\nTURBT is carried out under general anaesthetic. The surgeon uses an instrument called a cystoscope to locate the visible tumours and cut them away from the lining of the bladder. The wounds are sealed (cauterised) using a mild electric current, and you may be given a&nbsp;catheter to drain any blood or debris from your bladder over the next few days.\nAfter surgery,&nbsp;you may be given a&nbsp;single dose of&nbsp;chemotherapy, directly into your bladder,&nbsp;using a catheter. The solution is kept in your bladder for around an hour before being drained away.\nMost people are able to leave hospital less than 48 hours after having TURBT and are able to resume normal physical activity within 2 weeks.\nYou should be offered follow-up appointments at 3 months and nine months to check your bladder, using a cystoscopy. If your cancer returns after 6 months and is small, you may be offered a treatment called fulguration. This involves using an electric current to destroy the cancer cells.\nPeople with intermediate-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer should be offered a course of at least 6 doses of chemotherapy. The liquid is placed directly into your bladder,&nbsp;using a catheter, and kept there for around an hour before being drained away.\nYou should be offered follow-up appointments at 3 months, 9 months, 18 months, then once every year.&nbsp;At&nbsp;these appointments, your bladder will be checked using a cystoscopy.&nbsp;If your cancer returns within 5 years, you&#8217;ll be referred back to a specialist urology team.\nSome residue of the chemotherapy medication may be left in your urine after treatment, which could severely irritate your skin. It helps&nbsp;if you urinate while sitting down and that you&#8217;re careful not to splash yourself or the toilet seat. After passing urine, wash the skin around your genitals with soap and water.\nIf you&#8217;re sexually active, it&#8217;s important to use a barrier method of contraception, such as a condom. This is&nbsp;because the medication may be present in your semen or vaginal fluids, which can cause irritation.\nYou also shouldn&#8217;t try to get pregnant or father a child while having chemotherapy for bladder cancer, as the medication can increase the risk of having a child with birth defects.\nPeople with high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer should be offered a second TURBT operation, within 6 weeks of the initial investigation&nbsp;(see diagnosing bladder cancer). A CT scan&nbsp;or an&nbsp;MRI scan may also be required.\nYour urologist and clinical nurse specialist&nbsp;will discuss&nbsp;your treatment options with you, which will either be:\n- a course of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) treatment – using a variant of the&nbsp;BCG vaccine\n- an operation to remove your bladder (cystectomy)\nThe BCG vaccine is passed into your bladder through a catheter and left for 2 hours before being drained away. Most people require weekly treatments over a 6-week period. Common side effects of&nbsp;BCG include:\n- a frequent need to urinate\n- pain when urinating\n- blood in your urine (haematuria)\n- flu-like symptoms, such as tiredness, fever and aching\n- urinary tract infections\nIf&nbsp;BCG&nbsp;treatment doesn&#8217;t work, or the side effects are too strong, you&#8217;ll be referred back to a specialist urology team.\nYou should be offered follow-up appointments every 3 months for the first 2 years, then every 6 months for the next 2 years, then once a year.&nbsp;At&nbsp;these appointments, your bladder will be checked using a cystoscopy.\nIf you decide to have a cystectomy, your surgeon will&nbsp;need to&nbsp;create an alternative way for urine to leave your body (urinary diversion). Your clinical nurse specialist can discuss your options for the procedure and how the urinary diversion will be created.\nRead about the&nbsp;complications of bladder cancer surgery&nbsp;for more information about urinary diversion and sexual problems after surgery.\nAfter having a cystectomy,&nbsp;you should be offered follow-up appointments including a CT scan at six and 12 months, and&nbsp;blood tests once a year. Men require an appointment to check their urethra once a year for 5 years.\nThe recommended treatment plan for muscle-invasive bladder cancer depends on how far the cancer has spread. With T2 and&nbsp;T3 bladder cancer, treatment aims to cure the condition if possible, or at least control it for a long time.\nYour urologist, oncologist and clinical nurse specialist&nbsp;will discuss&nbsp;your treatment options with you, which will either be:\n- an operation to remove your bladder (cystectomy) – see above\n- radiotherapy with a radiosensitiser\nYour oncologist&nbsp;should also discuss the possibility of having chemotherapy before either&nbsp;of these treatments (neoadjuvant therapy), if it&#8217;s suitable for you.\nRadiotherapy is given by a machine that beams the radiation at the bladder (external radiotherapy). Sessions are usually given on a daily basis for 5 days a week over the course of 4 to 7 weeks. Each session lasts for about 10 to 15 minutes.\nA radiosensitiser&nbsp;should also be given alongside radiotherapy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer. This is a medicine which affects the cells of a tumour, to enhance the effect of radiotherapy. It has a much smaller effect on normal tissue.\nAs well as destroying cancerous cells, radiotherapy can also damage healthy cells, which means it can cause a number of side effects. These include:\n- diarrhoea \n- inflammation of the bladder (cystitis)\n- tightening of the vagina (in women), which can make having sex painful\n- erectile dysfunction (in men)\n- loss of pubic hair\n- infertility\n- tiredness\n- difficulty passing urine\nMost of these side effects should pass a few weeks after your treatment finishes, although there&#8217;s a chance they&#8217;ll be permanent.\nHaving radiation directed at your pelvis usually means you&#8217;ll be infertile for the rest of your life.&nbsp;However, most people treated for bladder cancer are too old to have children, so this isn&#8217;t usually a problem.\nAfter having radiotherapy for bladder cancer,&nbsp;you should be offered follow-up appointments&nbsp;every 3 months for the first 2 years, then every 6 months for the next 2 years, and every year after that.&nbsp;At&nbsp;these appointments, your bladder will be checked using a cystoscopy.&nbsp;\nYou may also be offered CT scans of your abdomen, pelvis and chest after 6 months, 1 year and 2 years. A CT scan of your urinary tract may be offered every year for 5 years.\nYour MDT may recommend a specific treatment&nbsp;because of&nbsp;your individual circumstances.\nFor example, someone with a small bladder or&nbsp;many existing urinary symptoms is better suited to surgery. Someone who has a single bladder tumour with normal bladder function is better suited for treatments that preserve the bladder.\nHowever, your input is also important, so you should discuss which treatment is best for you with your MDT.\nThere are pros and cons of both surgery and radiotherapy.\nThe pros of having a radical cystectomy include:\n- treatment is carried out in one go\n- you won&#8217;t need regular cystoscopies after treatment, although other less invasive tests&nbsp;may be needed\nThe cons of having a radical cystectomy include:\n- it can take up to 3 months to fully recover\n- a risk of general surgical complications, such as pain, infection and bleeding\n- a risk of complications from the use of&nbsp;general anaesthetic\n- an alternative way of passing urine out of your body needs to be created, which may involve an external bag\n- a high risk of erectile dysfunction in men (estimated at around 90%)&nbsp;as a result of nerve damage\n- after surgery, some women may find sex uncomfortable, as their vagina may be smaller\n- a small chance of a fatal complication, such as a heart attack, stroke or deep vein thrombosis (DVT)\nThe pros of having radiotherapy include:\n- there&#8217;s no need to have surgery, which is often an important consideration for people in poor health\n- your bladder function may not be affected, as your bladder isn&#8217;t removed\n- there&#8217;s less chance of causing erectile dysfunction (around 30%)\nThe cons of having radiotherapy include:\n- you&#8217;ll require regular sessions of radiotherapy for 4 to 7 weeks\n- short-term side effects are common,&nbsp;such as diarrhoea, tiredness and inflammation of the bladder (cystitis)\n- a small chance&nbsp;of permanently damaging the bladder, which could lead to problems urinating\n- women may experience a narrowed vagina, making sex difficult and uncomfortable\nIn some cases,&nbsp;chemotherapy may be used during treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Instead of medication being put directly into your bladder, it&#8217;s put into a vein in your arm. This is called intravenous chemotherapy and can be used:\n- before radiotherapy and surgery to shrink the size of any tumours\n- in combination with radiotherapy before surgery (chemoradiation)\n- to slow the spread of incurable advanced bladder cancer (palliative chemotherapy)\nThere isn&#8217;t enough evidence to say whether chemotherapy is an effective treatment when it&#8217;s given after surgery to prevent the cancer returning. It&#8217;s usually only used this way as part of a clinical trial. See clinical trials for bladder cancer for more information.\nChemotherapy is usually given over a few consecutive days at first. You&#8217;ll then have a few weeks off to allow your body to recover before the treatment begins again. This cycle will be repeated for a few months.\nAs the chemotherapy medication is being injected into your blood, you&#8217;ll experience a wider range of side effects than if you were having chemotherapy directly into the bladder. These side effects should stop after the treatment has finished.\nChemotherapy weakens your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection. It&#8217;s important to report any symptoms of a potential infection, such as a high temperature, persistent cough or reddening of the skin, to your MDT. Avoid close contact with people who are known to have an infection.\nOther&nbsp;side effects of chemotherapy can include:\n- nausea\n- vomiting\n- hair loss\n- lack of appetite\n- tiredness\nThe recommended treatment plan for&nbsp;locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer&nbsp;depends on how far the cancer has spread. Your oncologist should discuss your treatment options with you, which may include:\n- a course of chemotherapy\n- treatments to relieve cancer symptoms\nIf you receive a course of chemotherapy, you&#8217;ll be given a combination of drugs to help relieve the side effects of treatment. Treatment may be stopped if chemotherapy isn&#8217;t helping, or a second course may be offered.\nYou may be offered treatment to relieve any cancer symptoms. This may include:\n- radiotherapy to treat painful urination, blood in urine, frequently needing to urinate or pain in your pelvic area\n- treatment to drain your kidneys, if they become blocked and cause lower back pain\nIf your cancer is at an advanced stage and can&#8217;t be cured, your MDT should discuss how the cancer will progress and which treatments are available to ease the symptoms.&nbsp;\nYou can be referred to a palliative care team, who can provide support and practical help, including pain relief.\nRead more about end of life care\nA diagnosis of bladder cancer, and some treatments for the condition, can have a significant impact on your life.\nThe emotional impact of living with bladder cancer can be huge. Many people report experiencing a kind of &#8216;rollercoaster&#8217; effect. For example, you may feel down at receiving a diagnosis,&nbsp;up when&nbsp;the cancer&nbsp;is removed, and down again as you try to come to terms with the after-effects of your treatment.\nThis type of emotional disruption can sometimes trigger feelings of depression. Signs that you may be depressed include:\n- having continuous feelings&nbsp;of sadness&nbsp;or hopelessness\n- no longer taking pleasure in the things you enjoy\nContact your GP for advice if you think you may be depressed. There&#8217;s a range of relatively successful treatments for depression, including antidepressant medication and&nbsp;therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).\nRead more about&nbsp;coping with cancer\nIf&nbsp;your bladder is removed, an alternative way of passing urine out of your&nbsp;body will be created during the operation. This is called urinary diversion.\nThere are various types of urinary diversion, which are described below. In some cases, you may be able to make a choice based on your personal preferences. However, certain treatment options will not be suitable for everyone.\nYour multidisciplinary team (MDT) can provide information on the most suitable options for you.\nA urostomy is&nbsp;carried out during a radical cystectomy. A small section of&nbsp;the small bowel is&nbsp;removed and&nbsp;connected to your ureters (the 2 tubes that normally carry urine out of the kidneys).\nThe surgeon&nbsp;then creates a small hole in the surface of your abdomen and the open end of the removed bowel is placed in this hole, creating an opening known as a stoma.\nA&nbsp;special waterproof&nbsp;bag&nbsp;is placed over the stoma to collect urine. A&nbsp;stoma nurse will teach you how to care for your stoma, and how and when to change the bag.\nContinent urinary diversion is similar to a urostomy, but&nbsp;without an external bag. Instead, a section of your bowel&nbsp;is used to create a pouch inside your body that stores urine.\nThe ureters are connected to the pouch and the pouch is connected to an opening in the abdominal wall.&nbsp;A valve in the opening (stoma) prevents urine leaking out.\nThe pouch is emptied using a&nbsp;thin, flexible tube&nbsp;(catheter). Most people need to empty their pouch about 4 or 5 times a day.\nIn some cases it may be possible to create a new bladder, known as a neobladder. This involves removing a section of your bowel and reconstructing it into a balloon-like sac, before connecting it to your urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body) at one end and your ureters at the other end. However, bladder reconstruction isn&#8217;t suitable for everyone.&nbsp;\nYou&#8217;ll be taught how to empty your neobladder by relaxing the muscles in your pelvis, while&nbsp;tightening the muscles in your abdomen at the same time.\nYour neobladder won&#8217;t contain the same types of nerve endings as a real bladder, so you won&#8217;t get the distinctive sensation that tells you to pass urine. Some people experience a feeling of fullness inside their abdomen, while others have reported they feel like they need to pass wind.\nBecause of&nbsp;the loss of normal nerve function, most people with a neobladder experience some episodes of&nbsp;urinary incontinence, which usually occurs during the night, while they&#8217;re asleep.\nYou may find it useful to empty your neobladder at set times during the day, including before you go to bed, to help prevent incontinence.\nContact your&nbsp;MDT if you lose the ability to obtain or maintain an erection after a radical cystectomy. It may be possible for you to be treated with a type of medicine known as phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5). PDE5s work by increasing the blood supply to your penis.\nPDE5s are sometimes combined with&nbsp;a device called a vacuum pump, which consists of a&nbsp;cylinder connected to a pump. The penis is placed inside the cylinder and the air is pumped out. This creates a vacuum that causes blood to&nbsp;flow into the penis. A rubber ring is then placed around the base of the penis, which allows an erection to be maintained for around 30 minutes.\nRead more about treating erectile dysfunction\nBoth radiotherapy and cystectomy can cause a woman&#8217;s vagina to become shortened and narrowed, which can make penetrative sex painful or difficult.\nThere are 2 main treatment options available if you have a narrowed vagina. The first is to apply hormonal cream to the area, which should help to increase moisture inside your vagina.\nThe second is to use vaginal dilators. These are&nbsp;plastic cone-shaped devices of various sizes&nbsp;that are designed to gently stretch&nbsp;your vagina and make it more supple.\nIt&#8217;s usually recommended that you&nbsp;use&nbsp;dilators&nbsp;for a 5 to&nbsp;10-minute period every day, starting with the dilator that fits in easiest first and&nbsp;gradually increasing the size, as your vagina stretches over the following weeks.\nMany women find this an embarrassing issue to discuss, but the use of dilators is a well-recognised treatment for narrowing of the vagina. Your specialist cancer nurse should be able to provide more information and advice.\nYou may find that the&nbsp;more often you have penetrative sex, the less painful it becomes. However, it may be several months before you feel emotionally ready to be intimate with a sexual partner.\nMacmillan Cancer Support has further information about sex and the side effects of cancer treatment.\nIt&#8217;s not always possible to prevent bladder cancer, but some risk factors have been identified, which may increase your risk of developing the condition.\nIf you smoke, giving up is the best way to reduce your risk of developing bladder cancer and preventing it from recurring.\nIf you decide to stop smoking, you&nbsp;could contact the Quit Your Way Scotland&nbsp;service on&nbsp;0800 84 84 84&nbsp;(8.00am to 10.00pm, every day). The specially trained helpline staff will&nbsp;offer you free expert advice and encouragement.\nIf you&#8217;re committed to giving up smoking, but&nbsp;don&#8217;t want to be referred to a stop smoking service, your GP should be able to prescribe medical treatment to help with any withdrawal symptoms you may experience after giving up.\nFor more information and advice about giving up smoking, have a browse through&nbsp;stop smoking treatments and the stop smoking home page.\nYour risk of bladder cancer could be increased if your job involves exposure to certain chemicals. Occupations linked to an increased risk of bladder cancer are manufacturing jobs involving:\n- rubber\n- dyes\n- textiles\n- plastic\n- leather tanning\n- diesel fumes\nNowadays, there are rigorous safety protocols in place designed to minimise your risk of exposure, and&nbsp;chemicals known to increase the risk of bladder cancer have been banned. If you&#8217;re uncertain about what these protocols involve, talk to your line manager or health and safety representative.\nIf you&#8217;re concerned that your employer may be disregarding recommendations about workplace safety, you should contact the Health and Safety Executive for advice.\nThere&#8217;s some evidence to suggest that a diet high in fruit and vegetables and low in fat can help to prevent bladder cancer.\nEven though this evidence is limited, it&#8217;s a good idea to follow this type of healthy diet, as it can help to prevent other types of cancer, such as bowel cancer, as well as serious health conditions, including high blood pressure (hypertension), stroke and heart disease.\nA low-fat, high-fibre diet is recommended, including plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (5 portions a day) and whole grains. Limit the amount of salt you eat to no more than 6g (0.2oz) a day (1 teaspoon) because too much can increase your blood pressure.\nYou should try to avoid foods that contain saturated fat, as it&nbsp;can increase your cholesterol levels.\nFoods high in saturated fat include:\n- meat pies\n- sausages and fatty cuts of meat\n- butter\n- ghee (a type of butter often used in Indian cooking)\n- lard\n- cream\n- hard cheese\n- cakes and biscuits\n- foods that contain coconut or palm oil\nHowever, a balanced diet should include a small amount of unsaturated fat, because&nbsp;this will actually help to control your cholesterol levels.\nFoods&nbsp;high in unsaturated fat include:\n- oily fish\n- avocados\n- nuts and seeds\n- sunflower, rapeseed, olive and vegetable oils\nRead more about&nbsp;healthy eating"

        "disease": "Blood poisoning (sepsis)",
        "description": "Always trust your instincts and phone 999 if you think there&#8217;s an emergency.\nIf your GP practice is closed, phone 111.\nTrust your instincts and phone 111 if your child&rsquo;s symptoms are getting worse or they are sicker than you&rsquo;d expect (even if their temperature falls).\nSepsis is a serious complication of an infection.\nWithout quick treatment, sepsis can lead to multiple organ failure and death.\nThe immune system usually keeps an infection limited to one place. This is called a localised infection. To do this, the body produces white blood cells.\nWhite blood cells travel to an infection site to destroy the germs causing the infection. This triggers tissue swelling, known as inflammation. This helps to fight the infection and prevent it from spreading.\nHowever, an infection can spread to other parts of the body if the immune system is weak or an infection is severe.\nWidespread inflammation can damage tissue and interfere with blood flow. When blood flow is interrupted, blood pressure can drop dangerously low. This stops oxygen from reaching the organs and tissues.\nSepsis can be triggered by an infection in any part of the body. The most common sites of infection that lead to sepsis are the:\n- lungs\n- urinary tract\n- tummy (abdomen)\n- pelvis\nHowever, sometimes the specific infection and source of sepsis can&#8217;t be identified.\n- appendicitis – infection in the appendix\n- cellulitis – a skin infection that can be caused by an intravenous catheter that&#8217;s been inserted through the skin to give fluids or medication\n- cholangitis – an infection of the bile duct\n- cholecystitis – an infection of the gallbladder\n- encephalitis &#8211; an infection of the brain and nervous system\n- endocarditis – a heart infection\n- flu – only in some cases\n- meningitis – an infection of the brain and nervous system\n- peritonitis – an infection of the thin layer of tissue that lines the abdomen\n- pneumonia &#8211; a lung infection\n- post-surgery infections\n- osteomyelitis – a bone infection\n- urinary tract infection – an infection of the bladder, urethra or kidneys\nSepsis is often diagnosed by testing your:\n- temperature\n- heart rate\n- breathing rate\n- blood\nOther tests can help determine the type of infection, where it&#8217;s located and which parts of the body have been affected. These include:\n- urine or stool samples\n- a wound culture – where a small sample of tissue, skin or fluid is taken from the affected area for testing\n- respiratory secretion testing – taking a sample of saliva, phlegm or mucus\n- blood pressure tests\n- imaging studies – like an X-ray, ultrasound scan or computerised tomography (CT) scan\nAnyone can develop sepsis after an injury or minor infection. However, some people are more vulnerable, including people who:\n- are very young\n- are very old\n- are pregnant\n- have had a urinary catheter fitted\n- have a long term health condition like diabetes\n- have recently had surgery\n- are genetically prone to infections\n- are already in hospital with a serious illness\n- have to stay in hospital for a long time\n- have wounds or injuries as a result of an accident\n- have a medical condition that weakens the immune system – like HIV or leukaemia\n- are receiving medical treatment that weakens the immune system – like chemotherapy or long-term steroids\n- are on mechanical ventilation – where a machine is used to help you breathe\nSome people make a full recovery from sepsis fairly quickly. The amount of time it takes to fully recover from sepsis varies depending on:\n- the severity of the sepsis\n- the person&#8217;s overall health\n- how much time was spent in hospital\n- whether treatment was needed in an intensive care unit (ICU)\nSome people with sepsis will experience long-term physical and psychological problems. This is known as post-sepsis syndrome.\nSymptoms of post-sepsis syndrome include:\n- feeling lethargic or excessively tired\n- muscle weakness\n- swollen limbs\n- joint pain\n- chest pain\n- breathlessness\nSepsis can cause a variety of symptoms.\n- over 38C (babies under 3 months)\n- over 39C (babies aged 3 to 6 months)\n- below 36C – check 3 times in a 10-minute period\n- a high temperature in a child who can’t be encouraged to show interest in anything\n- difficulty breathing – this looks like hard work\n- grunting with every breath\n- struggling to speak more than a few words at once (for older children who normally talk)\n- breathing that obviously &#8220;pauses&#8221;\n- no interest in feeding (child under 1 month)\n- not drinking for more than 8 hours (when awake)\n- black, green or bloody vomit\n- a soft spot on a baby&#8217;s head that bulges\n- “sunken” eyes\n- a baby that’s floppy\n- a child that can’t be encouraged to show interest in anything\n- weak, whining or continuous crying in a younger child\n- confusion in an older child\n- irritableness\n- unresponsive\n- stiffness in the neck, especially when trying to look up or down\n- not had a wee or wet nappy for 12 hours\nEarly symptoms of sepsis may include:\n- a high temperature (fever) or low body temperature\n- chills and shivering\n- a fast heartbeat\n- fast breathing\nIn some cases, symptoms of more severe sepsis or septic shock&nbsp;(when your blood pressure drops to a dangerously low level) develop.\nThese can include:\n- feeling dizzy or faint\n- a change in mental state – like confusion or disorientation\n- diarrhoea\n- nausea and vomiting\n- slurred speech\n- severe muscle pain\n- severe breathlessness\n- less urine production than normal – for example, not urinating for a day\n- cold, clammy and pale or mottled skin\n- loss of consciousness\nTreatment for sepsis varies, depending on the:\n- area affected\n- cause of the infection\n- organs affected\n- extent of any damage\nIf you have the early signs of sepsis, you&#8217;ll usually be referred to hospital. You&#8217;ll then be given a diagnosis and treatment.\nYou&#8217;ll need emergency treatment, or treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU), if:\n- the sepsis is severe\n- you develop septic shock&nbsp;– when your blood pressure drops to a dangerously low level\nICUs can support body functions like breathing that are affected by sepsis. This allows the medical staff to focus on treating the infection.\nSepsis is treatable if it&#8217;s identified and treated quickly. In most cases it leads to full recovery with no lasting problems.\nThe main treatment for sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock is antibiotics. These will be given directly into a vein (intravenously).\nIdeally, antibiotic treatment should start within an hour of diagnosis.\nIntravenous antibiotics are usually replaced by tablets after 2 to 4 days. You may have to take them for 7 to 10 days or longer, depending on the severity of your condition.\nIf sepsis is suspected, broad-spectrum antibiotics are given first. This is because there won&#8217;t be time to wait until a specific type of infection has been identified.\nBroad-spectrum antibiotics work against a wide range of known infectious bacteria. They usually cure most common infections.\nOnce a specific bacterium has been identified, a more focused antibiotic can be used.\nIf the sepsis is caused by a virus, antibiotics won&#8217;t work. However, it would be too dangerous to delay treatment to find out the specific cause. This means antibiotics are usually given anyway.\nWith a viral infection, you&#8217;ll need to wait until your immune system starts to tackle it. However, antiviral medication may be given in some cases.\nIf you have sepsis, your body needs more fluid to prevent dehydration and kidney failure.\nIf you have severe sepsis or septic shock, you&#8217;ll usually be given fluids intravenously for the first 24 to 48 hours.\nIt&#8217;s important that the doctors know how much urine your kidneys are making when you have sepsis. This helps them spot signs of kidney failure.\nIf you&#8217;re admitted with severe sepsis or septic shock, you&#8217;ll usually be given a catheter. This is inserted into your bladder to monitor your urine output.\nYour body&#8217;s oxygen demand goes up if you have sepsis.\nIf you&#8217;re admitted to hospital with sepsis and the level of oxygen in your blood is low, you&#8217;ll usually be given oxygen. This is given through a mask or tubes in your nostrils.\nIf a source of the infection can be identified, like an abscess or infected wound, this will also need to be treated.\nFor example, any pus may need to be drained away. In more serious cases, surgery may be needed to remove the infected tissue and repair any damage.\nMedications called vasopressors are used if you have low blood pressure caused by sepsis.\nVasopressors are normally given intravenously while you&#8217;re in an ICU. Extra fluids may also be given intravenously to help increase blood pressure.\nYou may require additional treatments like:\n- corticosteroids\n- insulin medication\n- a blood transfusion\n- mechanical ventilation – where a machine is used to help you breathe\n- dialysis – where a machine filters your blood to copy the function of your kidneys\nThese treatments are mostly used in ICUs."

        "disease": "Bone cancer",
        "description": "Primary bone cancer is a rare type of cancer that begins in the bones.&nbsp;\nThis is a separate condition from secondary bone cancer, which is cancer that spreads to the bones after developing in another part of the body.\nThese pages only refer to primary bone cancer. The Macmillan Cancer Support website has more information about secondary bone cancer.\nBone cancer can affect any bone, but most cases develop in the long bones of the legs or upper arms.\nThe main symptoms include:\n- persistent bone pain that gets worse over time and continues into the night\n- swelling and redness (inflammation)&nbsp;over a bone, which can make movement difficult if&nbsp;the affected&nbsp;bone is near a joint\n- a noticeable lump over a bone\n- a weak bone that breaks (fractures) more easily than normal\nIf you or your child are experiencing persistent, severe or worsening&nbsp;bone pain, visit your GP. While it&#8217;s highly unlikely to be the result of bone cancer, it does require further investigation.\nRead more about the symptoms of bone cancer\nSome of the main types of bone cancer are:\n- osteosarcoma – the most common type, which mostly affects children and&nbsp;young adults under 20\n- Ewing sarcoma&nbsp;– which most commonly affects people aged between 10&nbsp;and 20\n- chondrosarcoma – which tends to affect adults aged over 40\nYoung people can be affected because&nbsp;the rapid growth spurts that occur during&nbsp;puberty&nbsp;may make bone tumours develop.\nThese types of bone cancer&nbsp;affect different types of&nbsp;cell. The treatment and outlook will depend on the type of bone cancer you have.\nIn most cases, it&#8217;s not known why a person develops bone cancer.\nYou&#8217;re more at risk&nbsp;of developing it if you:\n- have had previous exposure to&nbsp;radiation&nbsp;during&nbsp;radiotherapy\n- have a condition known as Paget&#8217;s disease of the bone&nbsp;– however, only a very small number of people with Paget’s disease will actually develop bone cancer\n- have a rare genetic condition called&nbsp;Li-Fraumeni syndrome&nbsp;–&nbsp;people with this condition have a faulty version of a gene that normally helps stop the growth of cancerous cells\nRead more about the causes of bone cancer\nTreatment for bone cancer depends on the type of bone cancer you have and how far it has spread.\nMost people have a combination of:\n- surgery to remove the section of cancerous bone – it&#8217;s often possible to reconstruct or replace the bone that&#8217;s been removed,&nbsp;but&nbsp;amputation&nbsp;is sometimes necessary\n- chemotherapy&nbsp;–&nbsp;treatment&nbsp;with powerful cancer-killing medication\n- radiotherapy&nbsp;–&nbsp;where&nbsp;radiation is used to destroy cancerous cells\nIn some cases of&nbsp;osteosarcoma,&nbsp;a medication called mifamurtide may also&nbsp;be recommended.\nRead more about treating bone cancer\nThe outlook for bone cancer depends on&nbsp;factors such as&nbsp;your age, the type of bone cancer you have, how far the cancer has spread (the stage), and how likely it is to spread further (the grade).\nGenerally, bone cancer is much easier to cure in otherwise healthy people whose cancer hasn&#8217;t spread.\nBone pain is the most common symptom of bone cancer. Some people experience other symptoms as well.\nPain caused by bone cancer usually begins with a feeling of tenderness in the affected bone. This&nbsp;gradually progresses to a persistent ache or ache that comes and goes, which continues at night and when resting.\nAny bone can be affected, although bone cancer most often develops in the long bones of the legs or upper arms.\nThe&nbsp;pain can sometimes be&nbsp;wrongly mistaken for&nbsp;arthritis in adults and growing pains&nbsp;in children and teenagers.\nSome people&nbsp;also experience swelling and redness (inflammation) or&nbsp;notice a lump on or around the affected bone. If the bone is near a joint, the swelling may make it difficult to use the joint.\nIn some cases, the cancer can weaken a bone, causing it to break (fracture) easily&nbsp;after a minor injury or fall.\nLess common symptoms can include:\n- a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above\n- unexplained weight loss\n- sweating, particularly&nbsp;at night\nSpeak to your GP if you or your child experiences persistent, severe or worsening bone pain, or if you&#8217;re worried about any symptoms.\nWhile it&#8217;s highly unlikely that your symptoms are caused by cancer, it&#8217;s best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis.\nRead more about diagnosing bone cancer\nCancer occurs when the cells in a certain area of your body divide and multiply too rapidly. This produces a lump of tissue known as a tumour.\nThe exact reason why this happens is often not known, but certain things can increase your chance of developing the condition, including:\n- previous&nbsp;radiotherapy treatment\n- other&nbsp;bone conditions, such as Paget&#8217;s disease of the bone\n- rare genetic conditions, such as&nbsp;Li-Fraumeni syndrome\n- a history of certain other conditions, including retinoblastoma and umbilical hernia\nPrevious exposure to high doses of radiation&nbsp;during radiotherapy&nbsp;may cause cancerous changes in your bone cells at a later stage, although this risk is thought to be small.\nSome non-cancerous (benign) conditions affecting the bones may increase your chances of developing bone cancer, although the risk is still small.\nIn particular, a condition called Paget’s disease of the bone&nbsp;can increase the risk of bone cancer in people over 50&nbsp;to 60 years of age.\nRarer conditions that cause tumours to grow in your bones, such as Ollier&#8217;s disease, can also increase your risk of bone cancer.\nA rare genetic condition called&nbsp;Li-Fraumeni syndrome can increase your risk of developing bone cancer, as well as several other types of cancer.\nPeople with this condition have a faulty version of a gene that usually helps stop the growth of tumours in the body.\nPeople who had a rare type of eye cancer called retinoblastoma&nbsp;as a child may be more likely to develop bone cancer, because the same inherited faulty gene can be responsible for both conditions.\nResearch has also found that babies born with an umbilical hernia&nbsp;are three times more likely to develop a type of bone cancer called Ewing sarcoma,&nbsp;although the risk is still&nbsp;very small.\nIf you&#8217;re experiencing bone pain, your GP will ask about your symptoms and examine the affected area, before deciding whether you need to have any further tests.\nThey will look for any swelling or lumps, and ask if you have&nbsp;problems moving the affected area. They may ask about the type of pain you experience – whether it&#8217;s constant or comes and goes, and whether anything makes it worse.\nAfter being examined, you may be&nbsp;referred for an X-ray of the affected area to look for any problems in the bones. If the X-ray shows abnormal areas, you&#8217;ll be referred to&nbsp;an orthopaedic surgeon (a specialist in bone conditions) or bone cancer specialist&nbsp;for a further assessment.\nAn X-ray&nbsp;is a procedure where radiation is used to&nbsp;produce images of the inside of the body. It&#8217;s a particularly effective way of looking at bones.\nX-rays can often detect damage to the bones caused by cancer, or new bone that&#8217;s growing because of cancer.&nbsp;They can also determine whether your symptoms are&nbsp;caused by&nbsp;something else, such as a broken&nbsp;bone (fracture).\nIf&nbsp;an X-ray suggests you may have bone cancer, you should be referred to a specialist centre with expertise in diagnosing and treating the condition. As bone cancer is&nbsp;rare,&nbsp;there are a&nbsp;small number of specialist centres, so you may have to travel outside your local area for advice and treatment.\nThe most definitive way of diagnosing bone cancer is to take a sample of affected bone and send it to a laboratory for testing. This is known as a biopsy.\nA biopsy can determine exactly what type of bone cancer you have and what grade it is (see below).\nA biopsy can be&nbsp;carried out&nbsp;in two ways:\n- A core needle biopsy is&nbsp;performed under anaesthetic (depending on where the bone is located, this could be a&nbsp;local anaesthetic or general anaesthetic).&nbsp;A thin needle is inserted into the bone and used to remove a sample of tissue.\n- An open biopsy is&nbsp;performed under a general anaesthetic. The surgeon makes an incision in the affected bone to remove a sample of tissue.\nYou may need to have an open biopsy if the results of a core needle biopsy are inconclusive.\nIf the results of the biopsy confirm or suggest bone cancer, it&#8217;s likely you&#8217;ll have further tests to assess how far the cancer has spread. These tests are described below.\nA&nbsp;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan&nbsp;uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed pictures of the bones and soft tissues.\nAn MRI scan is an effective way of assessing the size and spread of any cancerous tumour in or around the bones.\nA computerised tomography (CT) scan&nbsp;involves taking a series of X-rays and using a computer to reassemble them into a detailed three-dimensional (3D) image of your body.\nCT scans are often used to check if the cancer has spread to your lungs. Chest X-rays may also be taken for this purpose.\nA bone scan can&nbsp;give more detailed information about the inside of your bones than an X-ray. During a bone scan,&nbsp;a small amount of radioactive material is injected into your veins.\nAbnormal areas of bone will absorb the material at a faster rate than normal bone and will show up as &#8220;hot spots&#8221; on the scan.\nIf you have a type of bone cancer called Ewing sarcoma, you may have a test called a bone&nbsp;marrow biopsy to check if the cancer has spread to the bone marrow (the tissue inside your bones).\nDuring the test,&nbsp;a needle is inserted into your bone to remove a sample of your bone marrow. This may be done under either local or general anaesthetic.\nOnce these tests have been completed, it should be possible to tell you what stage and grade the bone cancer is. Staging is a description of how far a cancer has spread and grading is a description of how quickly the cancer is likely to spread in the future.\nA widely used staging system for bone cancer in&nbsp;the UK&nbsp;uses 3 main stages:\n- stage 1 – the cancer is low-grade and has not spread beyond the bone\n- stage 2 – the cancer has still not spread beyond the bone, but is a high-grade\n- stage 3 &nbsp;– the cancer has spread into other parts of the body, such as the lungs\nMost cases of stage 1 bone cancer and some stage 2 bone cancers have a good&nbsp;chance of being cured. Unfortunately, stage 3 bone cancer is more difficult to cure, although treatment can relieve symptoms and slow the spread of the cancer.\nBeing told&nbsp;you have bone cancer can be a distressing and frightening experience. Receiving that type of news can be upsetting at any age, but can be particularly difficult if you are still in your teenage years, or&nbsp;if you&#8217;re a parent of a child who has just been told&nbsp;they have bone cancer.\nThese types of feelings can cause considerable stress and anxiety, which in some cases can trigger&nbsp;depression. If you think you may be depressed,&nbsp;your GP may be a good person to talk to about support and possibly&nbsp;treatment.\nYou may also find it useful to contact the Bone Cancer Research Trust, which is the UK’s leading charity for people affected by bone cancer, if you need more information. If you&#8217;re a teenager you may want to contact the Teenage Cancer Trust, which is a charity for teenagers and young adults affected by cancer.\nRead more about coping with a cancer diagnosis\nTreatment for bone cancer depends on the type of bone cancer you have, how far it has spread and your general health. The main treatments are surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.\nYour treatment should be managed by a specialist centre with experience in treating bone cancer, where you&#8217;ll be cared for by a team of different healthcare professionals known as a multi-disciplinary team (MDT).\nMembers of the MDT will include an orthopaedic surgeon (a surgeon who specialises in bone and joint surgery), a clinical oncologist (a specialist in the non-surgical treatment of cancer) and a specialist cancer nurse, among others.\nYour MDT will recommend what they think is the best treatment for you, but the final decision will be yours.\nYour recommended treatment plan may include a combination of:\n- surgery to remove the section of cancerous bone – it&#8217;s often possible to reconstruct or replace the bone that&#8217;s been removed, although amputation&nbsp;is occasionally necessary\n- chemotherapy&nbsp;–&nbsp;treatment&nbsp;with powerful cancer-killing medication\n- radiotherapy&nbsp;–&nbsp;where&nbsp;radiation is used to destroy cancerous cells\nIn some cases, a medication called mifamurtide may be recommended as well.\nSurgery to remove the cancerous area of bone is an important part of treatment for bone cancer, although it&#8217;s often combined with the other treatments mentioned below.\nNowadays, it&#8217;s usually possible to avoid removing an affected body part completely (known as limb-sparing surgery), although up to 1 in every 10 people may need to have a limb permanently removed (amputation).\nLimb-sparing surgery is usually possible when the cancer has not spread beyond the bone, and the bone can be reconstructed.\nThe most common type of limb-sparing surgery involves removing the section of affected bone and some of the surrounding tissue (in case any cancerous cells have spread into the tissue).\nThe removed section of bone&nbsp;may then be&nbsp;replaced with a metal implant called a prosthesis or a piece of bone from elsewhere in your body (bone graft).\nIf the cancer is near a joint, such as the knee, it may be&nbsp;possible to remove the joint and replace it with an artificial one. Read more about&nbsp;knee joint replacement and hip joint replacement.\nAmputation&nbsp;may be necessary if limb-sparing surgery is not possible or has not worked well. For example, it may be necessary if:\n- the cancer has spread beyond the bone into major blood vessels or nerves\n- you developed an infection after limb-sparing surgery and the prosthesis or bone graft had to be removed&nbsp;\n- the cancer has developed in a part of the body where limb-sparing surgery is not technically possible, such as the ankle\nYour care team will understand the shock and fear that you, or your child, may be feeling if an amputation is needed and should be able to provide you with&nbsp;counselling and other support. In some cases, your care team may be able to introduce you to someone who has already had an amputation.\nAfter an amputation, most people use an artificial limb to replace the limb that&#8217;s removed. These limbs are now very advanced and convenient to use. For example, people with an artificial leg are often able to walk, run and play sport, and have an excellent quality of life.\nAfter limb-sparing surgery or an amputation, you&#8217;ll need help to return to normal life. This is known as rehabilitation.\nRehabilitation will usually involve physiotherapy&nbsp;sessions, where you carry out exercises to help regain proper function in the treated body part, and occupational therapy, where you&#8217;re taught skills to help you cope with day-to-day activities.\nAfter an amputation, you may be referred to a local limb centre for advice, support and rehabilitation treatment. Read more about living with an amputation.\nThere are 4 ways chemotherapy can be used to treat bone cancer. It can be used:\n- before surgery, to shrink the tumour and make surgery easier\n- in combination with radiotherapy before surgery (chemoradiation)&nbsp;– this approach works particularly well in the treatment of&nbsp;Ewing sarcoma\n- after surgery, to prevent the cancer returning\n- to control symptoms in cases where a cure is not possible (known as palliative chemotherapy)\nChemotherapy for bone cancer involves taking a combination of different medications that are usually delivered via a drip into your vein, or into a line inserted into a bigger blood vessel.\nThe&nbsp;treatment is&nbsp;usually given in cycles. A cycle involves taking the chemotherapy medication for several days, then having a break for a few weeks to allow your body to recover from the effects of the treatment. The number of cycles&nbsp;you&nbsp;need will depend on the type and grade of your bone cancer.\nChemotherapy can damage healthy cells as well as cancerous cells, which means it often causes a number of side effects.\nCommon side effects of chemotherapy include:\n- nausea&nbsp;and vomiting&nbsp;\n- diarrhoea\n- mouth ulcers&nbsp;\n- tiredness\n- increased risk of catching infections\n- temporary hair loss\n- infertility&nbsp;\nMost side effects associated with chemotherapy should resolve once your treatment has finished. However, there is a risk&nbsp;you will be permanently infertile. Your care team will provide more detailed information about the specific risk to your fertility.\nRead more about the side effects of chemotherapy\nAs with chemotherapy, radiotherapy can be used before and after surgery to treat bone cancer, or used to control the symptoms and slow the spread of cancer when a cure is not possible.\nRadiotherapy for bone cancer involves beams of radiation being directed at the cancerous section of bone by an external machine.\nThis is normally given in daily sessions, 5 days a week, with each session lasting a few minutes. The whole course of treatment will usually last a few weeks.\nThe radiation you&#8217;re exposed to during radiotherapy will mostly be focused on the cancerous cells, but healthy cells nearby can also be damaged. This can lead to&nbsp;side effects such as:\n- reddening and irritation of the skin (this can feel much like sunburn)\n- joint pain in the part of the body that is being treated\n- feeling sick\n- hair loss in the body part being treated\n- tiredness\nThese side effects will pass once the radiotherapy has been completed, although feelings of tiredness may persist for several weeks.\nRead more about the side effects of radiotherapy\nFor people with a type of bone cancer called osteosarcoma, a medication called mifamurtide may be used alongside other treatments.\nMifamurtide is an immune macrophage stimulant. This means it works by encouraging the immune system to produce specialised cells&nbsp;that kill cancerous cells.\nIt&#8217;s normally recommended for young people with&nbsp;high-grade osteosarcomas and is given&nbsp;after surgery, in combination with chemotherapy, to help prevent the cancer returning.\nMifamurtide is slowly pumped into one of your veins over the course of an hour (known as infusion). The recommended course of treatment is usually twice a week for 12 weeks, and then once a week for a further 24 weeks.\nMifamurtide can cause a wide range of side effects. These can include:\n- nausea and vomiting&nbsp;\n- diarrhoea or&nbsp;constipation\n- headache&nbsp;\n- dizziness\n- loss of appetite\n- tiredness and weakness\nIt&#8217;s unclear whether it&#8217;s safe to take mifamurtide during pregnancy, so as a precaution it&#8217;s important&nbsp;to&nbsp;use an effective method of contraception if you&#8217;re a sexually active woman. You will need to tell your MDT as soon as possible if you&nbsp;think you&#8217;re&nbsp;pregnant, and you should avoid breastfeeding while taking mifamurtide.\nOnce your treatment has finished, you&#8217;ll need to attend regular follow-up appointments to check&nbsp;the cancer hasn&#8217;t returned.\nYou&#8217;ll be asked to attend frequent appointments in the first two years after treatment has finished – possibly every 3 months.&nbsp;These will&nbsp;become less frequent as the years go on.\nContact your specialist or GP if you develop&nbsp;symptoms of bone cancer again and think the cancer may have come back."

        "disease": "Bone cancer: Teenagers and young adults",
        "description": "This section about bone cancer is for teenagers and young adults. There are different types of bone cancer, and most of this information applies to all types. If you have a rare type of bone cancer and want to know more, you could talk to the Macmillan Support Line.\nIf you&#8217;re looking for information about bone cancer in people of all ages, read our general&nbsp;bone cancer section.\nThere are different types of bone cancer. The&nbsp;2 most common bone cancers to affect teenagers are osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma.\nOsteosarcomas are most likely to affect bones in the leg, especially around the knee joint, but they can affect any bone.\nEwing sarcoma can affect any bone, but it’s most common in the pelvis (which is made up of the tail bone and the&nbsp;2 hip bones), or in leg bones. Ewing sarcoma can sometimes start outside the bone in the soft tissue. This is called soft tissue Ewing sarcoma, and is treated in the same way. Sarcoma is the name for a cancer that starts in any connective tissue, such as muscle, fat or cartilage.\nIn this information we sometimes use the term ‘bone tumour’. This means the same as bone cancer.\nThe cause of bone cancer is unknown. Because it’s more common in young people, doctors think that it may be linked to the changes that happen when bones are growing. There is lots of ongoing research into the possible causes.\nPeople often think a knock or injury might have caused bone cancer, but there’s no evidence for this.\nRemember that nothing you’ve done has caused the cancer.\nBone cancer symptoms vary, and not everyone will feel the same. Many symptoms are similar to everyday aches and pains, so they can be mistaken for other things, like strains, sports injuries or growing pains.\nThe main symptoms are:\n- pain&nbsp;or tenderness&nbsp;– this may start as an ache that doesn’t go away and may be made worse by exercise or feel worse at night\n- swelling around the affected area of bone&nbsp;– swelling may not show up until the tumour is quite large and it isn’t always possible to see or feel a lump if the affected bone is deep inside the body\n- reduced movement&nbsp;– if the bone tumour is near a joint (like an elbow or knee), it can make it harder to move the joint; if it’s in a leg bone, it may cause a limp; if it’s in the backbone (spine), it may press on nerves and cause tingling and numbness in the legs or arms\n- a&nbsp;broken bone&nbsp;– a bone may break suddenly, or after only a minor fall or accident if the bone has been weakened by cancer.\nThere might also be other symptoms including:\n- tiredness&nbsp;\n- a&nbsp;high temperature&nbsp;\n- loss of appetite&nbsp;\n- weight loss\nIf you have any of these symptoms, or you are worried that you may have a bone tumour, you should get it checked by your GP. They can talk to you about your symptoms, and arrange&nbsp;tests&nbsp;if they feel they’re needed.\nRemember&nbsp;– most people with these symptoms won’t have bone cancer.\nKnowing what your bones do might help you understand what bone cancer is.\nBones are like human scaffolding. They help keep&nbsp;you upright. The human skeleton is made up of more than 200 bones of different shapes and sizes.\nBones do lots of important things:&nbsp;\n- they work with joints and connective tissue so that&nbsp;you can move around\n- they protect parts of the body from injury&nbsp;– for example, the ribs protect the heart and lungs\n- they store calcium\n- some bones contain bone marrow, which make blood cells\nJoints help bones fit together so that we can move freely. There are different types of joint. Some work as levers, like the finger joint. Others are ball-and-socket joints, such as the hip joint. There are different types of connective tissue that help bones move:&nbsp;&nbsp;\n- ligaments are tough cords of tissue that attach bones to each other\n- cartilage is a slippery material that covers the ends of bones to stop them rubbing together\n- muscles are made of tough, stretchy tissue&nbsp;and give strength\n- tendons are strong cords of tissue that attach muscles to bones\nWe also have more information about:\n- symptoms of bone cancer&nbsp;\n- having tests for bone cancer&nbsp;\n- treatment for bone cancer&nbsp;\n- life after bone cancer&nbsp;\nIf you&#8217;re looking for information about bone cancer in people of all ages, read our general&nbsp;bone cancer section.&nbsp;\nThere are some tests you might have when you visit your GP or at the hospital. The tests will help the doctors see whether you have bone cancer.\nIf you think you might have some of the symptoms of bone cancer, you should speak to your GP.\nYour GP will talk to you about your symptoms, examine you and usually arrange some tests, such as X-rays and blood tests. There may be a number of reasons why you&#8217;re feeling unwell, so it can be difficult to diagnose the problem straight away. If your GP can&#8217;t find the cause, you may be referred to a specialist at the hospital.\nThe hospital you&#8217;re referred to will depend on the results of the tests. You may go straight to a doctor specialising in bone cancer, or you might see doctors with more general experience first.\nThe hospital doctor will examine you and arrange for some of the following tests:&nbsp;\n- X-rays&nbsp;\n- bone scans&nbsp;\n- biopsies&nbsp;\n- MRI and/or CT scans\nIf you&#8217;re diagnosed with bone cancer and not already seeing a specialist bone doctor, you’ll be referred to one.&nbsp;\nIf the tests show you have bone cancer, you might need a few more tests to check how your body is working in general:&nbsp;\n- blood tests&nbsp;\n- tests to check your heart is healthy&nbsp;\n- chest X-rays to check your lungs are healthy&nbsp;\n- tests to check your kidneys are healthy&nbsp;– you may need to give a sample of&nbsp;pee (urine) to be tested\nThis may seem like a lot of tests, but they’ll help the doctors plan the best treatment for you.\nHaving tests and waiting for the results can be an anxious time. Talking about how you feel and getting support from family, friends, your specialist nurse or your doctor can help.\nWe have more information about:\n- the bones\n- symptoms of bone cancer&nbsp;\n- treatment for bone cancer&nbsp;\n- life after bone cancer&nbsp;\nIf you&#8217;re looking for information about bone cancer in people of all ages, read our general&nbsp;bone cancer section.\nThe information on this page is about Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma.\nThe&nbsp;3 main treatments for bone cancer are chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy. Most people have a combination of these.\nYour doctors will plan your treatment based on:&nbsp;\n- the type of bone cancer you have&nbsp;\n- where the cancer is&nbsp;\n- the stage of the cancer (this means whether it has spread outside the bone)&nbsp;\n- how fast-growing the cancer is\nIf you have any questions about your treatment, ask your doctor or nurse. They&#8217;ll be happy to help you understand what&#8217;s involved.\nYou may be offered the opportunity to take part in a clinical research trial. These trials help doctors find new and better treatments for people with bone cancer. If your doctor thinks you are suitable for a clinical trial, they&#8217;ll discuss this with you.\nIn this information we sometimes use the term ‘bone tumour’. This means the same as bone cancer.\nChemotherapy is when you’re given anti-cancer drugs to destroy the cancer cells. It’s an important treatment for bone tumours. It helps shrink the tumour before surgery or radiotherapy, and it can kill cells that have spread outside the bone. After your surgery or radiotherapy, you’ll usually have more chemotherapy.\nChemotherapy for bone cancer is given into a vein, usually through a central line, a port or a PICC line.\nYou’ll have chemotherapy over a few days and then you’ll have some time off to give your body a chance to recover from any side effects. The days you have the chemotherapy and the rest period afterwards is called a cycle. Most people have several cycles of chemotherapy. You&#8217;ll probably need to stay in hospital for some of the time during chemotherapy.&nbsp;\nThe type of chemotherapy you have depends on whether the tumour is an Ewing sarcoma or an osteosarcoma.\nFor Ewing sarcoma, the drugs most often used first are vincristine, ifosfamide, doxorubicin and etoposide. Giving these drugs together is called VIDE. You’ll usually have&nbsp;6 cycles of VIDE.\nAfter your chemotherapy you may have surgery, or, if the tumour can’t be removed with an operation, you’ll have radiotherapy. Some people have both surgery and radiotherapy. The team looking after you will decide on the best combination for you.\nIf you have surgery, you’ll have more chemotherapy afterwards to help stop the tumour coming back or spreading to other parts of the body.\nAt the moment, there is a clinical trial called Euro-Ewing 2012 that is comparing different combinations of chemotherapy treatments before and after surgery for people with Ewing sarcomas. You can talk to your specialist doctor about whether you could take part in this trial.\nOsteosarcoma is usually treated with&nbsp;3 chemotherapy drugs called methotrexate, doxorubicin (Adriamycin) and cisplatin. Giving these drugs together is called MAP.\nYou will usually have&nbsp;6 cycles of chemotherapy in total. Each cycle takes about&nbsp;5 weeks. After the first&nbsp;2 cycles, you’ll have surgery to remove the cancer.\nIf the cancer has spread, you may also need to have surgery on another part of your body. For example, if osteosarcoma spreads outside of the main tumour, it usually spreads to the lungs. If the cancer has spread to your lungs, you may need a second operation to remove the cancer in your lungs. If you have bone cancer that&#8217;s spread, your doctors will talk to you about what will happen next.\nAfter surgery, you’ll have&nbsp;4 more cycles of MAP chemotherapy. You may also be given a new treatment called mifamurtide (Mepact), which helps your body kill tumour cells.&nbsp;Your doctor will tell you if you can have this drug as well as your chemotherapy.\nDifferent chemotherapy drugs cause different side effects. Some people have just a few side effects and others have more. It&#8217;s hard to know how it&#8217;s going to be for you. Most side effects are temporary and gradually disappear once treatment stops.\nThe most common are a sore mouth, hair loss, tiredness, sickness and being more at risk of getting an infection.\nThe most common side effect of mifamurtide is having a high temperature or feeling cold and shivery for a few hours after it’s given.\nThe surgery you have will depend on the type of bone cancer you have and where it is in the body.\nYour surgeon will aim to remove all of the cancer, while trying to keep as much function in the limb as possible.\nMost people with bone cancer have an operation called limb-sparing surgery. This means the surgeon removes the cancer without having to remove the arm or leg it’s in. You’ll have all the tumour taken away from your limb, including any bone and muscle affected by the tumour.\nIt’s usually possible to remove the affected part of the bone and replace it with a custom-made metal fitting (endoprosthesis) or with a bone from another part of the body (bone graft). If the cancer affects a bone in or near a joint, the whole joint can often be replaced with an artificial one.&nbsp;In some cases, the surgeon can remove the affected bone without replacing it with anything and without it affecting the way you move.\nIf you&#8217;ve had chemotherapy, you&#8217;ll need&nbsp;2 or&nbsp;3 weeks to recover before you can have your operation. Doctors will make sure that you&#8217;re well enough to have the operation. If you’ve lost weight or been off your food, you might need to build yourself up a bit before the operation. The hospital dietitian can help you do this. You’ll probably see a physiotherapist, who’ll give you exercises to strengthen your muscles.\nYou may like to see the replacement part or endoprosthesis (often just called a prosthesis) that will be put in during your operation. If you would like to see it, your surgeon or key worker can usually arrange this.\nYou’ll have a bandage or splint on your limb to keep it supported and let it heal.\nYou’ll probably have a tube, called a drain, coming out of your wound. This stops fluid building up in your wound. A nurse will take it out after about 3 to 4 days.\nYou won’t feel like eating or drinking much for a few hours after your operation, so you’ll be given fluids into a vein. This is called a drip.\nYou’ll probably feel a bit sore to begin with, but you’ll be given strong painkillers to help. It’s important to tell the nurses if you need extra pain relief. The pain usually starts to get better within 2 or 3 days. As time goes on, you&#8217;ll need fewer painkillers and will start to feel a lot more comfortable.\nOnce you’re home, you should start to feel a bit better and stronger every day. But if you do have any problems, it’s important to tell your doctor or nurse right away, so they can deal with them quickly.\nAfter your operation, you will need to do lots of physiotherapy to help you make the best possible recovery. This can feel like hard work but is really important. Your physiotherapist will tell you what exercises to do, and help you to do them regularly.\nIf you notice any new redness, pain or swelling in the limb that’s been operated on, it’s very important to get in touch with your doctor right away. You might have an infection that needs treatment, so you’ll need to see the surgeon who did your operation without delay.\nThere&#8217;s more information about the long-term effects of limb-sparing surgery in our section on living with and after bone cancer.\nSometimes the only way to get rid of the bone cancer affecting an arm or a leg is to remove the limb. This is called an amputation. It’s only done if there is no alternative. This is usually needed if the cancer has spread from the bone and has grown around nearby blood vessels. These need to be removed along with the cancer.\nSome people choose to have an amputation rather than limb-sparing surgery. You should be given a chance to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of both types of surgery with your team.\nAn amputation may also need to be done if there’s an infection in the bone that doesn’t go away with treatment, or if the cancer comes back in the bone. Every person and every tumour is different, so you might meet other people with the same type of tumour, who are having slightly different surgery. Your specialist will talk to you about your operation and make sure you understand what&#8217;s involved.\nYour doctor will talk things through with you so that you fully understand what’s involved. Losing a limb can feel very scary and it might help to talk to your specialist nurse, key worker or a counsellor about your feelings. It might also help to talk to someone who’s had an amputation&nbsp;– your nurse or doctor can arrange this. It&#8217;s really important to get support at this tough time.\nYou’ll have bandages or a plaster cast on the area that’s been operated on. There’ll be a tube, called a drain, coming from the wound. This stops fluid building up. A nurse will usually take it out after 3 or 4 days. You’ll also have a drip to give you fluid into a vein in your arm until you feel like eating and drinking again.\nYou’ll probably feel a bit sore after your op, especially for the first 2 or 4 days, but you&#8217;ll be given strong painkillers to help with this. It’s important to tell the nurses if you need extra pain relief. As time goes on, you’ll need fewer painkillers and will start to feel a lot more comfortable. You may have pain that feels like it’s coming from the part of the limb that’s been removed. This is known as ‘phantom pain’. Let your doctor or nurse know if you have this. There are medicines that can help ease it or take it away. It usually gets better and goes away in time.\nA physiotherapist will visit you a day or so after your operation. They’ll show you exercises to keep your muscles strong and flexible.\nIf you’ve had an arm removed, you’ll be able to get up and move around once you’ve recovered from the anaesthetic and don’t feel too sore. If you’ve had a leg removed, the physiotherapist will show you how to move around in bed and get from your bed to a chair. You&#8217;ll probably be moving around with crutches or in a wheelchair within a few days.\nOnce you’re up and about, you’ll go to the hospital gym for physiotherapy. This is a big part of your recovery. Your physiotherapist will give you more exercises to do as your wound heals and you get stronger.\nIt’ll take a few months for your limb to heal to its final shape after the operation, so you won’t be fitted with your permanent prosthesis until this happens. In the meantime, you’ll be given a temporary prosthesis and learn how to use it in physiotherapy.\nYou should be able to go home about&nbsp;2 weeks after your operation.\nThere&#8217;s more information about the long-term effects of amputation in our section on living with and after bone cancer.\nRadiotherapy treats cancer by using high-energy X-rays to destroy cancer cells.\nRadiotherapy is mainly used to treat Ewing sarcoma. You may have radiotherapy after your chemotherapy, or before or after having surgery.\nIf you have osteosarcoma, you’re less likely to have radiotherapy treatment. But you might have it if an operation to remove the cancer isn’t possible. Occasionally, people with osteosarcoma have radiotherapy after surgery to remove their cancer.\nRadiotherapy is generally given every weekday (Monday to Friday) for&nbsp;5 weeks. Each treatment takes a few minutes.\nRadiotherapy isn&#8217;t painful, but it can cause other side effects. After a few treatments you may begin to feel tired, and your skin may go red or get darker and feel sore or itchy around the area that’s being treated. This gets better once your radiotherapy treatment is over.\nOther side effects depend on which part of your body is being treated. Having radiotherapy around a joint can make it feel stiff, but physiotherapy can help.\nWe also have more information about:\n- symptoms of bone cancer\n- having tests for bone cancer&nbsp;\n- life after bone cancer&nbsp;\n- the bones\nIf you&#8217;re looking for information about bone cancer in people of all ages, read our general&nbsp;bone cancer section.&nbsp;\nThis information is about life after having surgery for bone cancer.\nThe long-term effects of limb-sparing surgery depend on which part of your body is affected and what kind of operation you have. The best person to ask about this is your surgeon.\nAfter limb-sparing surgery, the limb might not work as well as it used to. Physiotherapy is an important part of your recovery. You’ll be given exercises to do to help you get your limb working as well as possible. These can be hard work, but it’s important to keep going with them.\nIf you’ve had a knee joint replacement, you’ll be able to walk and swim, but your doctor might advise you not to play high-impact sports like hockey, football, tennis or rugby. These activities could damage or loosen the new joint.\nIt’s usually&nbsp;OK to run a short distance, for example for a bus. But running or jogging regularly wears out the new joint, so it’s best to avoid this. If your knee joint wears out or loosens, you might need to have it replaced after a few years.\nAfter a hip joint replacement, you should be able to do most of your usual activities, but you’ll probably be advised to avoid running and high-impact sports.\nIf you’ve had a shoulder replacement, you’ll be able to move your arm below shoulder height the same as before, but you might not be able to lift your arm above your shoulder.\nIf you’ve had an implant put into your limb while you’re still growing, you’ll need to have it lengthened as your leg or arm grows. Some types of implant can be lengthened without an operation, but with others you’ll need surgery. Your specialist or key worker can tell you what kind of implant you have.\nAfter amputation, you usually have an artificial limb fitted. This is called a prosthesis. There are artificial limbs designed to let you do all types of physical activities, including walking, swimming, running, cycling and playing sports.\nDifferent types of prosthesis let you do different things. Some people have one for wearing day-to-day, and an extra one specially designed for something like swimming or doing athletics.\nThings may be tough as you get used to living with the changes in your body, but help is available. You might have lots of different emotions. You might be tearful, angry, fed up or sad at times. You might feel like you&#8217;ve lost all your confidence and that you&#8217;ll never be able to live a normal life or be in a relationship. These feelings are normal, and it&#8217;s important to get support to help you cope with them. You could talk to:&nbsp;\n- your specialist nurse or key worker&nbsp;\n- family or friends&nbsp;\n- a counsellor, which can be arranged by your nurses&nbsp;\n- other young people in a similar situation\nOther people&#8217;s reactions can be hard to cope with too. You might be worried about what your friends think or how they&#8217;re going to treat you. The thought of going back to school, college or work can be scary. Even people in your family who you are close to might not know what to say or do. Others might say things that sound stupid or seem hurtful.\nTry to choose a couple of really close relatives or friends who you can talk to if things get you down. You might find it useful to talk to someone outside your close circle, like your specialist nurse, key worker or counsellor. Most people find it helps to talk about how they&#8217;re feeling or what’s on their mind.\nWhen you finish your treatment, your doctor will talk to you about what happens next. They will explain some of the long-term risks that bone cancer and its treatment could have for you. They will make arrangements to see you in a clinic to see how you are getting on.\nWe have more info about:\n- the bones\n- symptoms of bone cancer&nbsp;\n- having tests for bone cancer&nbsp;\n- treatment for bone cancer\nIf you&#8217;re looking for information about bone cancer in people of all ages, read our general&nbsp;bone cancer section."

        "disease": "Bowel cancer",
        "description": "Bowel cancer is a general term for cancer that begins in the large bowel. Depending on where the cancer starts, bowel cancer is sometimes called colon or rectal cancer.\nCancer can sometimes start in the small bowel (small intestine), but small bowel cancer is much rarer than large bowel cancer.\nBowel cancer is one of the most common types of cancer diagnosed in the UK.\nThe 3 main symptoms of bowel cancer are:\n- blood in the poo\n- changes in bowel habit – like more frequent, looser poo\n- abdominal (tummy) pain\nHowever, these symptoms are very common and most people with them do not have bowel cancer. For example, blood in the poo is more often caused by haemorrhoids (piles), and a change in bowel habit. Abdominal pain is usually the result of something you have eaten.\nAs almost 9&nbsp;out of 10 people with bowel cancer are over the age of 60, these symptoms are more important as people get older. They are also more significant when they persist despite simple treatments.\nMost people who are eventually diagnosed with bowel cancer have one of the following combinations of&nbsp;symptoms:\n- a persistent change in bowel habit that causes them to go to the toilet more often and pass looser poo, usually together with blood on or in their poo\n- a persistent change in bowel habit without blood in their poo, but with abdominal pain\n- blood in the poo without other haemorrhoid symptoms, like soreness, discomfort, pain, itching or a lump hanging down outside the back passage\n- abdominal pain, discomfort or bloating always brought on by eating, sometimes resulting in a reduction in the amount of food eaten and weight loss\nThe symptoms of bowel cancer can be subtle and don&#8217;t necessarily make you feel ill.\nRead about the symptoms of&nbsp;bowel cancer, and when you should see your GP to discuss whether any tests are necessary.\nYour doctor will probably carry out a simple examination of your tummy and bottom to make sure you have no lumps.\nThey may also arrange for a simple blood test to check for iron deficiency anaemia. This can indicate whether there&#8217;s any bleeding from your bowel that you haven&#8217;t been aware of.\nIn some cases, your doctor may decide it&#8217;s best for you to have a simple test in hospital to make sure there&#8217;s no serious cause for your symptoms.\nMake sure you return to your doctor if your symptoms persist or keep coming back after stopping treatment, regardless of their severity or your age.\nRead more about diagnosing bowel cancer\nIt&#8217;s not known exactly what causes bowel cancer, but there are a number of things that can increase your risk. These include:\n- age – almost&nbsp;9 in 10 cases of bowel cancer occur in people aged 60 or over\n- diet – a diet high in red or processed meats and low in fibre can increase your risk\n- weight – bowel cancer is more common in people who are overweight or obese\n- exercise – being inactive increases the risk of getting bowel cancer\n- alcohol and smoking – a high alcohol intake and smoking may increase your chances of getting bowel cancer\n- family history – having a close relative (mother or father, brother or sister) who developed bowel cancer&nbsp;under the age of&nbsp;50 puts you at a greater lifetime risk of developing the condition\nSome people have an increased risk of bowel cancer because they have another condition that affects their bowel, like severe ulcerative colitis or Crohn&#8217;s disease, over a long period of time.\nRead more about the causes of bowel cancer and preventing bowel cancer\nBowel screening is offered to men and women aged 50 to 74 across Scotland to help find bowel cancer early when it can often be cured.\nBowel screening involves taking a simple test at home every 2 years. The test looks for hidden blood in your poo, as this could mean a higher chance of bowel cancer.\nRead more about screening for bowel cancer\nBowel cancer can be treated using a combination of different treatments, depending on where the cancer is in your bowel and how far it has spread.\nThe main treatments are:\n- surgery – the cancerous section of bowel is removed\n- chemotherapy – where medication is used to kill cancer cells&nbsp;\n- radiotherapy – where radiation is used to kill cancer cells\n- biological treatments – a newer type of medication that increases the effectiveness of chemotherapy and prevents the cancer spreading\nAs with most types of cancer, the chances of a complete cure depends on how far&nbsp;it&nbsp;has advanced by the time it is diagnosed.\nRead more about how bowel cancer is treated and living with bowel cancer\nThe 3 main symptoms of bowel cancer are:\n- blood in the poo\n- a change in bowel habit, like more frequent, looser poo\n- abdominal (tummy) pain\nHowever, these symptoms are very common. Blood in the poo is usually caused by haemorrhoids (piles). A change in bowel habit or abdominal pain is often the result of something you have eaten.\nIn the UK, an estimated 7 million people have blood in their poo each year. Even more people have temporary changes in their bowel habits and abdominal pain. Most people with these symptoms do not have bowel cancer.\nAs the vast majority of people with bowel cancer are over the age of 60, these symptoms are more important as people get older.&nbsp;These symptoms&nbsp;are also more significant when they persist in spite of simple treatments.\nMost patients with bowel cancer present with one of the following symptom combinations:\n- a persistent change in bowel habit, causing them to go to the toilet more often and pass looser poo, usually together with blood on or in their poo\n- a persistent change in bowel habit without blood in their poo, but with abdominal pain\n- blood in your poo without other haemorrhoid symptoms, like soreness, discomfort, pain, itching, or a lump hanging down outside the back passage\n- abdominal pain, discomfort or bloating always provoked by eating, sometimes resulting in a reduction in the amount of food eaten and weight loss\nThe symptoms of bowel cancer can be subtle and don&#8217;t necessarily make you feel ill.\nRead about the symptoms of&nbsp;bowel cancer, and when you should see your GP to discuss whether any tests are necessary.\nYour doctor will probably perform a simple examination of your tummy and bottom to make sure you have no lumps.

This produces a lump of tissue known as a tumour.\nMost cases of bowel cancer develop inside clumps of cells on the inner lining of the bowel first. These clumps are known as polyps. However, if you develop polyps, it does not necessarily mean you will get bowel cancer.\nExactly what causes cancer to develop inside the bowel is still unknown. However, research has shown several factors may make you more likely to develop it.&nbsp;\nYour chances of developing bowel cancer increase as you get older. Almost&nbsp;9 out of 10 cases of bowel cancer in the UK are diagnosed in people over the age of 60.\nHaving a family history of bowel cancer can increase your risk of developing the condition yourself, particularly if a close relative (mother, father, brother or sister) was diagnosed with bowel cancer below the age of 50.\nIf you&#8217;re particularly concerned that your family&#8217;s medical history may mean you are at an increased risk of developing bowel cancer, it may help to speak to your GP.\nIf necessary, your GP can refer you to a genetics specialist, who can offer more advice about your level of risk and recommend any necessary tests to periodically check for the condition.\nA large body of evidence suggests a diet high in red and processed meat can increase your risk of developing bowel cancer.\nFor this reason, the Department of Health advises people who eat more than 90g (cooked weight) a day of red and processed meat cut down to 70g a day.\nRead more about red meat and bowel cancer risk\nThere&#8217;s also evidence that suggests a diet high in fibre could help reduce your bowel cancer risk.\nRead more about eating good food and a healthy diet\nPeople who smoke cigarettes are more likely to develop bowel cancer, other types of cancer, and other serious conditions like heart disease.\nRead more about stopping smoking\nDrinking alcohol is associated with an increased risk of bowel cancer, particularly if you regularly drink large amounts.\nRead about alcohol for information and tips on cutting down\nBeing overweight or obese is linked to an increased risk of bowel cancer, particularly in men.\nIf you&#8217;re overweight or obese, losing weight may help lower your chances of developing the condition.\nPeople who are physically inactive have a higher risk of developing bowel cancer.\nYou can help reduce your risk of bowel and other cancers by being more physically active.\nRead more about health and fitness\nSome conditions affecting the bowel may put you at a higher risk of developing bowel cancer. For example, bowel cancer is more common in people who have had severe&nbsp;Crohn&#8217;s disease&nbsp;or ulcerative colitis for many years.\nIf you have one of these conditions, you&#8217;ll usually have regular check-ups to look for signs of bowel cancer from about 10 years after your symptoms first develop.\nCheck-ups will involve examining your bowel with a colonoscope. This is a long, narrow flexible tube that contains a small camera that&#8217;s inserted into your rectum.\nThe frequency of the colonoscopy examinations will increase the longer you live with the condition. It will also depend on factors like how severe your ulcerative colitis is and if you have a family history of bowel cancer.\nThere are 2 rare inherited conditions that can lead to bowel cancer. They are:\n- familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) – a condition that triggers the growth of non-cancerous polyps inside the bowel\n- hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndrome – an inherited gene fault (mutation) that increases your bowel cancer risk\nAlthough the polyps caused by FAP are non-cancerous, there&#8217;s a high risk that, over time, at least one will turn cancerous. Most people with FAP will have bowel cancer by the time they are 50.\nAs people with FAP have such a high risk of getting bowel cancer, they are often advised by their doctor to have their large bowel removed before they reach the age of 25.\nFamilies affected can find support and advice from FAP registries such as The Polyposis Registry provided by St Mark&#8217;s Hospital, London.\nRemoving the bowel as a precautionary measure is also usually recommended in people with HNPCC because the risk of developing bowel cancer is so high.\nRead further information:\n- Bowel Cancer UK: Risk factors\n- Bowel Cancer UK: Diet\nWhen you first see your GP, they will ask about your symptoms and whether you have a family history of bowel cancer.\nThey will then usually carry out a simple examination of your abdomen (tummy) and your bottom. This is known as a digital rectal examination (DRE).\nThis is a useful way of checking whether there are any lumps in your tummy or back passage. The tests can be uncomfortable, and most people find an examination of the back passage a little embarrassing, but they take less than a minute.\nIf your symptoms suggest you may have bowel cancer or the diagnosis is uncertain, you&#8217;ll be referred to your local hospital initially for a simple examination called a flexible sigmoidoscopy.\nIn 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of bowel cancer and refer people for the right tests faster.\nTo find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected bowel cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on suspected cancer: recognition and referral.\nA flexible sigmoidoscopy is an examination of your rectum and some of your large bowel using a device called a sigmoidoscope.\nA sigmoidoscope is a long, thin, flexible tube attached to a very small camera and light. It&#8217;s inserted into your rectum and up into your bowel.\nThe camera relays images to a monitor, and can also be used to take biopsies. This is where a small tissue sample is removed for further analysis.\nIt&#8217;s better for your lower bowel to be as empty as possible when sigmoidoscopy is performed. This means you may be asked to carry out an enema at home. This is a simple procedure to flush your bowels. This should be used at least 2 hours before you leave home for your appointment.\nA sigmoidoscopy can feel uncomfortable, but it only takes a few minutes and most people go home straight after the examination.\nMost people with bowel cancer can be diagnosed by flexible sigmoidoscopy. However, some cancers can only be diagnosed by a more extensive examination of the colon.\nThe 2 tests used for this are colonoscopy and computerised tomography (CT) colonography.\nA colonoscopy is an examination of your entire large bowel using a device called a colonoscope. This is like a sigmoidoscope but a bit longer.\nYour bowel needs to be empty when a colonoscopy is performed. This means you&#8217;ll be advised to eat a special diet for a few days beforehand and to take a laxative (medication to help empty your bowel) on the morning of the examination.\nYou&#8217;ll be given a sedative to help you relax during the test. After this the doctor will insert the colonoscope into your rectum and move it along the length of your large bowel. This is not usually painful, but can feel uncomfortable.\nThe camera relays images to a monitor which allows the doctor to check for any abnormal areas within the rectum or bowel that could be the result of cancer. As with a sigmoidoscopy, a biopsy may also be performed during the test.\nA colonoscopy usually takes about&nbsp;an hour to complete, and most people can go home once they have recovered from the effects of the sedative.\nAfter the procedure, you&#8217;ll probably feel drowsy for a while so you&#8217;ll need to arrange for someone to accompany you home. It&#8217;s best for elderly people to have someone with them for 24 hours after the test. You&#8217;ll be advised not to drive for 24 hours.\nIn a small number of people, it may not be possible to pass the colonoscope completely around the bowel. This means it&#8217;s necessary to have CT colonography.\nFind out more about what&nbsp;a colonoscopy involves\nCT colonography, also known as a &#8216;virtual colonoscopy&#8217;, involves using a computerised tomography (CT) scanner to produce three-dimensional images of the large bowel and rectum.\nDuring the procedure, gas is used to inflate the bowel using a thin, flexible tube placed in your rectum. CT scans are then taken from a number of different angles.\nAs with a colonoscopy, you may need to have a special diet for a few days and take a laxative before the test. This helps to ensure your bowels are empty when the test is carried out.\nThis test can help identify potentially cancerous areas in people who are not suitable for a colonoscopy&nbsp;because of&nbsp;other medical reasons.\nA CT colonography is less invasive than a colonoscopy, but you may still need to have colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy at a later stage so any abnormal areas can be removed or biopsied.\nRead further information:\n- Bowel Cancer UK: Diagnosing bowel cancer\n- Cancer Research UK:&nbsp;Getting diagnosed\n- Macmillan Cancer Support:&nbsp;Symptoms of bowel cancer\nIf a diagnosis of bowel cancer is confirmed, further testing is usually carried out to check if the cancer has spread from the bowel to other parts of the body.&nbsp;These tests also help your doctors decide on the most effective treatment for you.\nThese tests can include a:\n- CT scan of your abdomen and chest –&nbsp;this will check if the rest of your bowel is healthy and whether the cancer has spread to the liver or lungs\n- magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan&nbsp;– this can provide a detailed image of the surrounding organs in people with cancer in the rectum\nOnce the above examinations and tests have been completed, it should be possible to determine the stage and grade of your cancer.\nStaging refers to how far your cancer has advanced. Grading relates to how aggressive your cancer is&nbsp;and how&nbsp;likely it is&nbsp;to spread.\nThis is important, as it helps your treatment team choose the best way of curing or controlling the cancer.\nA number of different staging systems are used by doctors.&nbsp;\n- stage 1 – the cancer is still contained within the lining of the bowel or rectum\n- stage 2 – the cancer has spread beyond the layer of muscle surrounding the bowel and may have penetrated the surface covering the bowel or nearby organs\n- stage 3 – the cancer has spread into nearby lymph nodes\n- stage 4 – the cancer has spread beyond the bowel into another part of the body, such as the liver\nThere are 3 grades of bowel cancer:\n- grade 1 – a cancer that grows slowly and has a low chance of spreading beyond the bowel\n- grade 2 – a cancer that grows moderately and has a medium chance of spreading beyond the bowel\n- grade 3 – a cancer that grows rapidly and has a high chance of spreading beyond the bowel\nIf you&#8217;re not sure what stage or grade of cancer you have, ask your doctor.\nIf&nbsp;colon cancer is at a very early stage, it may be possible to remove just a small piece of the lining of the colon wall. This is known as local excision.\nIf the cancer spreads into&nbsp;muscles surrounding the colon, it will usually be necessary to remove an entire section of your colon.&nbsp;This is known as a colectomy.\nThere are 2 ways a colectomy can be performed:\n- an open colectomy – where the surgeon makes a large cut (incision) in your abdomen and removes a section of your colon\n- a laparoscopic (keyhole) colectomy – where the surgeon makes a number of small incisions in your abdomen and uses special instruments guided by a camera to remove a section of colon\nDuring surgery, nearby lymph nodes are also removed. The ends of the bowel are usually joined together after bowel cancer surgery, but very occasionally this is not possible and a stoma is needed.\nBoth open and laparoscopic colectomies are thought to be equally effective at removing cancer and have similar risks of complications.\nHowever, laparoscopic colectomies have the advantage of a faster recovery time and less pain after the operation. It&#8217;s becoming the routine way of doing most of these operations.\nLaparoscopic colectomies should be available in all hospitals that carry out bowel cancer surgery, although not all surgeons perform this type of surgery. Discuss your options with your surgeon to see if this method can be used.\nThere are a number of different types of operation that can be carried out to treat rectal cancer, depending on how far the cancer has spread.\nSome of the main techniques used are described below:\nIf you have a very small, early-stage rectal cancer, your surgeon may be able to remove it in an operation called a local resection (transanal resection).\nThe surgeon puts an endoscope in through your back passage and removes the cancer from the wall of the rectum.\nIn many cases, however, a local resection is not possible. Instead, a larger area of the rectum will need to be removed.\nThis area will&nbsp;include a border of rectal tissue free of cancer cells, as well as fatty tissue&nbsp;from around the bowel&nbsp;(the mesentery). This type of operation is known as total mesenteric excision (TME).\nRemoving the mesentery can help ensure all the cancerous cells are removed, which can lower the risk of the cancer recurring at a later stage.\nDepending on where in your rectum the cancer is located, one of two main TME operations may be carried out.\nLow anterior resection is a procedure used to treat cases where the cancer is in the upper section of your rectum.\nThe surgeon will make an incision in your abdomen and remove the upper section of your rectum, as well as some surrounding tissue. This is to make sure any lymph glands containing cancer cells are also removed.\nThey will then attach your colon to the lowest part of your rectum or upper part of the anal canal. Sometimes they turn the end of the colon into an internal pouch to replace the rectum.\nYou&#8217;ll probably require a temporary stoma to give the joined section of bowel time to heal.\nAbdominoperineal resection is used to treat cases where the cancer is in the lowest section of your rectum.\nIn this case, all of your rectum and surrounding muscles must be removed. This is to reduce the risk of the cancer re-growing in the same area.\nThis involves removing and closing the anus and removing its sphincter muscles. This means there&#8217;s no option but to have a permanent stoma after the operation.\nBowel cancer surgeons always do their best to avoid giving people permanent stomas wherever possible.\nWhere a section of the bowel is removed and the remaining bowel joined, the surgeon may sometimes decide to divert your stool away from the join to allow it to heal.\nThe stool is temporarily diverted by bringing a loop of bowel out through the abdominal wall and attaching it to the skin – this is called a stoma. A bag is worn over the stoma to collect the stool.\nWhen the stoma is made from the small bowel (ileum) it&#8217;s called an ileostomy. When it is made from the large bowel (colon) it&#8217;s called a colostomy.\nA specialist nurse, known as a stoma care nurse, can advise you on the best site for a stoma&nbsp;prior to surgery.\nThe nurse will take into account factors like your body shape and lifestyle, although this may not be possible where surgery is performed in an emergency.\nIn&nbsp;the first few days&nbsp;after surgery, the stoma care nurse will advise on the care necessary to look after the stoma and the type of bag suitable.\nOnce the join in the bowel has safely healed, which can take several weeks, the stoma can be closed&nbsp;during further surgery.\nIn some people, re-joining the bowel may not be possible or may lead to problems controlling bowel function. This means the stoma may become permanent.\nBefore having surgery, the care team will advise you about whether it may be necessary to form an ileostomy or colostomy, and the likelihood of this being temporary or permanent.\nThere are patient support groups available that provide support for patients who have just had or are about to have a stoma. You can get more details from your stoma care nurse, or visit groups online for further information.\nIleostomy and Internal Pouch Support Group&nbsp;provides a unique visiting service for anyone wishing to speak with someone who has been through similar surgery\nLearn more about having a stoma after bowel cancer\nBowel cancer operations carry many of the same risks as other major operations, including:\n- bleeding\n- infection\n- blood clots\n- heart problems\n- breathing problems\nThe operations all carry a number of risks specific to the procedure.\nOne risk is that the joined-up section of bowel may not heal properly and leak inside your abdomen. This is usually only a risk in the first few days after the operation.\nAnother risk is for people who have rectal cancer surgery. The nerves that control urination and sexual function are very close to the rectum, and sometimes surgery to remove rectal cancer can damage these nerves.\nAfter rectal cancer surgery, most people need to go to the toilet to open their bowels more often than before. This usually settles down within a few months of the operation.\nThere are 2 main ways radiotherapy can be used to treat bowel cancer.\nIt can be given before surgery to shrink rectal cancers and increase the chances of complete removal. IT can also be used to control symptoms and slow the spread of cancer in advanced cases (palliative radiotherapy).\nRadiotherapy given before surgery for rectal cancer can be performed in 2 ways:\n- external radiotherapy – where a machine is used to beam high-energy waves at your rectum to kill cancerous cells\n- internal radiotherapy (brachytherapy) – where a radioactive tube is inserted into your anus and placed next to the cancer to shrink it\nExternal radiotherapy is usually given daily, 5 days a week, with a break at the weekend. Depending on the size of your tumour, you may need 1 to 5 weeks of treatment. Each session of radiotherapy is short and will only last for 10 to 15 minutes.\nInternal radiotherapy can usually be performed in one session before surgery is carried out a few weeks later.\nPalliative radiotherapy is usually given in short daily sessions, with a course ranging from 2 to 3 days, up to 10 days.\nShort-term side effects of radiotherapy can include:\n- feeling sick\n- fatigue\n- diarrhoea\n- burning and irritation of the skin around the rectum and pelvis&nbsp;–&nbsp;this looks and feels like sunburn\n- a frequent need to urinate\n- a burning sensation when passing urine\nThese side effects should pass once the course of radiotherapy has finished. Tell your care team if the side effects of treatment become particularly troublesome. Additional treatments are often available to help you cope with the side effects&nbsp;better.\nLong-term side effects of radiotherapy can include:\n- a more frequent need to pass urine or poo\n- blood in your urine and poo\n- infertility\n- erectile dysfunction\nIf you want to have children, it may be possible to store a sample of your sperm or eggs before treatment begins so they can be used in fertility treatments in the future.\nThere are 3 ways&nbsp;chemotherapy can be used to treat bowel cancer:\n- before surgery&nbsp;–&nbsp;used in combination with radiotherapy&nbsp;to shrink the tumour\n- after surgery&nbsp;–&nbsp;to reduce the risk of the cancer recurring\n- palliative chemotherapy&nbsp;– to slow the spread of advanced bowel cancer and help control symptoms\nChemotherapy for bowel cancer usually involves taking a combination of medications that kill cancer cells. They can be given as a tablet (oral chemotherapy), through a drip in your arm (intravenous chemotherapy), or as a combination of both.\nTreatment is given in courses (cycles) that are 2 to 3 weeks long each, depending on the stage or grade of your cancer.\nA single session of intravenous chemotherapy can last from several hours to several days.\nMost people having oral chemotherapy take tablets over the course of 2 weeks before having a break from treatment for another week.\nA course of chemotherapy can last up to 6 months, depending on how well you respond to the treatment. In some cases, it can be given in smaller doses over longer periods of time (maintenance chemotherapy).\nSide effects of chemotherapy can include:\n- fatigue\n- feeling sick\n- vomiting\n- diarrhoea\n- mouth ulcers\n- hair loss, but this is generally uncommon in the treatment of bowel cancer\n- a sensation of numbness, tingling or burning in your hands, feet and neck\nThese side effects should gradually pass once your treatment has finished. It usually takes a few months for your hair to grow back if you experience hair loss.\nChemotherapy can also weaken your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection.\nInform your care team or GP as soon as possible if you experience possible signs of an infection, including high temperature (fever) or a sudden feeling of being generally unwell.\nMedications used in chemotherapy can cause temporary damage to men&#8217;s sperm and women&#8217;s eggs. This means that for women who become pregnant or for men who father a child, there&#8217;s a risk to the unborn baby&#8217;s health.\nIt&#8217;s therefore recommended that you use a reliable method of contraception while having chemotherapy treatment and for a period after your treatment has finished.\nFind out more about&nbsp;chemotherapy&nbsp;&nbsp;\nBiological treatments, including cetuximab, bevacizumab and panitumumab, are a newer type of medication. They are also known as monoclonal antibodies.\nMonoclonal antibodies are antibodies that have been genetically engineered in a laboratory. They target special proteins found on the surface of cancer cells, known as epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR).\nAs EGFRs help the cancer grow, targeting these proteins can help shrink tumours, and improve the effect and outcome of chemotherapy.\nBiological treatments are therefore usually used in combination with chemotherapy when the cancer has spread beyond the bowel (metastatic bowel cancer).\nThese treatments are not available to everyone with bowel cancer. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has specific criteria&nbsp;that need to be met before these can be prescribed.\nCetuximab is only available on the NHS when:\n- surgery to remove the cancer in the colon or rectum has been carried out or is possible\n- bowel cancer has spread to the liver and cannot be removed surgically\n- a person is fit enough to undergo surgery to remove the cancer from the liver if this becomes possible after treatment with cetuximab\nCetuximab, bevacizumab and panitumumab are available on the NHS through a government scheme called the&nbsp;Cancer Drugs Fund. All these medications are also available privately, but are very expensive.\nFurther information is&nbsp;available from:\n- Macmillan Cancer Support:&nbsp;Targeted therapies and immunotherapies for bowel cancer\n- Bowel Cancer UK: Surgery\n- Cancer Research UK: Treatment\n- Bowel Cancer UK:&nbsp;Radiotherapy\n- Macmillan Cancer Support:&nbsp;Radiotherapy\nYour GP or nurse may be able to reassure you if you have questions. You may also find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor, psychologist or specialist telephone helpline operator. Your GP practice will have information on these.\nSome people find it helpful to talk to others with bowel cancer at a local support group or through an internet chat room.\nFind more about support from Bowel Cancer UK and Macmillan Cancer Support\nHaving cancer can cause a range of emotions. These may include:\n- shock\n- anxiety\n- relief\n- sadness\n- depression\nDifferent people deal with serious health problems in different ways. It&#8217;s hard to predict how knowing you have cancer will affect you.\nHowever, you and your loved ones may find it helpful to&nbsp;know about&nbsp;the feelings that people diagnosed with cancer have reported.\nRead about&nbsp;cancer and your emotions\nSurgeons and anaesthetists have found using an enhanced recovery programme after bowel cancer surgery helps patients recover more quickly.\nMost hospitals now use this programme. It involves giving you more information about:\n- what to expect before the operation\n- avoiding giving you strong laxatives to clean the bowel before surgery\n- giving you a sugary drink 2 hours before the operation to give you energy, in some cases\nDuring and after the operation, the anaesthetist controls the amount of IV fluid you need very carefully. After the operation you&#8217;ll be given painkillers that allow you to get up and out of bed by the next day.\nMost people will be able to eat a light diet the day after their operation.\nTo reduce the risk of&nbsp;blood clots in the legs (deep vein thrombosis), you may be given special compression stockings that help prevent blood clots, or a regular injection with a blood-thinning medication called&nbsp;heparin until you are fully mobile.\nA nurse or physiotherapist will help you get out of bed and regain your strength so that you can go home within a few days.\nWith the enhanced recovery programme, most people are well enough to go home within a week of their operation. The timing depends on when you and the healthcare professionals looking after you agree you are well enough to go home.\nYou will be asked to return to hospital a few weeks after your treatment has finished so that tests can be carried out to check for any remaining signs of cancer. You may also need routine check-ups for the next few years to look out for signs of the cancer recurring.\nIf you have had part of your colon removed, it&#8217;s likely your poo will be looser. This is because one of the roles of the colon is to absorb water from stools.\nThis may mean you need to go to the toilet more often to pass loose poo. Tell your care team if this becomes a problem, as medication is available to help control it.\nYou may find some foods upset your bowels, particularly during the first few months after your operation.\nDifferent foods can upset different people. Food and drink known to cause problems include:\n- fruit and vegetables that are high in fibre, like beans, cabbages, apples and bananas\n- fizzy drinks, like cola and beer\nYou may find it useful to keep a food diary to record the effects of different foods on your bowel.\nContact your care team if you find you&#8217;re having continual problems with your bowels as a result of your diet, or you&#8217;re finding it difficult to maintain a healthy diet. You may need to be referred to a dietitian for further advice.\nRead more about diet after treatment.\nIf you need a temporary or permanent stoma with an external bag or pouch, you may feel worried about how you look and how others will react to you.\nInformation and advice about living with a stoma is available on the ileostomy and colostomy topics. This includes stoma care, stoma products and stoma-friendly diets.\nFor those who want further information about living with a stoma, there are patient support groups that provide support for people who may have had, or are due to have, a stoma.\nYou can get more details from your stoma care nurse, or visit support groups online for further information.\nThe Ileostomy and Internal Pouch Support Group provide a unique visiting service for anyone wishing to speak with someone who has been through similar surgery.\nHaving cancer and&nbsp;receiving treatment may affect how you feel about relationships and sex. Although most people are able to enjoy a normal sex life after bowel cancer treatment, you may feel self-conscious or uncomfortable&nbsp;if you have&nbsp;a stoma.\nTalking about how you feel with your partner may help you both support each other. Or you may feel&nbsp;you&#8217;d like to talk to someone else about your feelings. Your doctor or nurse will be able to help.\nFind more information on&nbsp;body image and sex\nA diagnosis of cancer can cause money problems because you&#8217;re unable to work, or someone you&#8217;re close to has to stop working to look after you.\nFinancial support is available for carers and yourself if you have to stay off work for a while or stop work because of your illness.\nMacmillan Cancer Support has further information on money, finance and insurance\nThe following organisations could also offer help&nbsp;or information:\n- GOV.UK:&nbsp;benefits\n- Money Helper\nIf you&#8217;re told there&#8217;s nothing more that can be done to treat your bowel cancer, your GP will still provide you with support and pain relief. This is called palliative care. Support is also available for your family and friends.\nFind out more about palliative care\nVisit the following organisations for further support:\n- Macmillan Cancer Support:&nbsp;Looking after someone with cancer\n- Macmillan Cancer Support:&nbsp;End of life\n- Marie Curie\nThere are some things that increase your risk of bowel cancer that you can&#8217;t change, like your family history or your age.\nHowever, there are several ways&nbsp;you can&nbsp;lower your chances of developing the condition.\nIt may help prevent bowel cancer if you eat:\n- less cured and processed meat, like bacon, sausages and ham\n- less red meat and more fish\n- more fibre from cereals, beans, fruit and vegetables\nThe Department of Health advises people who eat more than 90g (cooked weight) of red and processed meat a day to cut down to 70g to help reduce their bowel cancer risk.&nbsp;\nRegular physical activity can lower the risk of developing bowel and other cancers.\nIt&#8217;s recommended adults do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, like cycling or fast walking, every week.\nRead more about&nbsp;keeping active\nBeing overweight or obese increases your chances of developing bowel cancer, so you should try to maintain a healthy weight to help lower your risk.\nYou can find out if you&#8217;re a healthy weight by using the BMI chart\nChanges to your diet and an increase in your&nbsp;physical activity will help keep your weight under control.\nRead more about how to maintain a healthy weight\nIf you smoke, stopping can reduce your risk of developing bowel and other cancers.\nQuit Your Way Scotland&nbsp;is an advice and support service for anyone trying to stop smoking in Scotland. To speak with an advisor, phone 0800 84 84 84&nbsp;from&nbsp;8am to 10pm, every day. Calls are free from landlines and mobiles.\nYour GP or pharmacist can also&nbsp;provide help, support and advice if you want to give up smoking.\nRead more about stopping smoking\nDrinking alcohol has been linked to an increased risk of developing bowel cancer, so you may be able to reduce your risk by cutting down on the amount of alcohol you drink.\nIf you drink most weeks, to reduce your risk of harming your health:\n- men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week\n- spread your drinking over 3 days or more if you drink as much as 14 units a week&nbsp;\nRead more about alcohol units and get tips on cutting down\nAlthough screening cannot stop you getting bowel cancer, it can allow the condition to be detected at an earlier stage, when it&#8217;s much easier to treat.\nAs well as making lifestyle changes and keeping an eye out for possible symptoms of bowel cancer, taking part in bowel cancer screening when it&#8217;s offered can help reduce your chances of dying from the condition.\nBowel screening is offered to men and women aged 50 to 74 across Scotland. If you’re 75 or over, you can still take a bowel screening test every 2 years. However, you’ll need to request a new test kit each time.\nRead more about bowel cancer screening\n"

        "disease": "Bowel incontinence",
        "description": "Bowel incontinence is an inability to control bowel movements, resulting in involuntary soiling. It&#8217;s also sometimes known as faecal incontinence.\nThe experience of bowel incontinence can vary from person to person. Some people feel a sudden need to go to the toilet but are unable to reach a toilet in time. This is known as urge bowel incontinence.\nOther people experience no sensation before soiling themselves, known as passive incontinence or passive soiling, or there might be slight soiling when passing wind.\nSome people experience incontinence on a daily basis, whereas for others it only happens from time to time.\nIt&#8217;s thought 1&nbsp;in 10 people will be affected by it at some point in their life. It can affect people of any age, although it&#8217;s more common in elderly people. It&#8217;s also more common in women than men.\nBowel incontinence is&nbsp;a symptom of an underlying problem or medical condition.\nMany cases are caused by diarrhoea, constipation, or weakening of the muscle that controls the opening of the anus.\nIt can also be caused by long-term conditions such as diabetes, multiple sclerosis and dementia.\nRead more about the causes of bowel incontinence.\nBowel incontinence can be upsetting and hard to cope with, but treatment is effective and a cure is often possible, so make sure you see your GP.\nIt&#8217;s important to remember that:\n- bowel incontinence isn&#8217;t something to be ashamed of – it&#8217;s simply a medical problem that&#8217;s no different from diabetes or asthma\n- it can be treated – there&#8217;s a wide range of successful treatments\n- bowel incontinence isn&#8217;t a normal part of ageing\n- it won&#8217;t usually go away on its own – most people need treatment for the condition\nIf you don&#8217;t want to see your GP, you can usually make an appointment at your local NHS continence service without a referral. These clinics are staffed by specialist nurses who can offer useful advice about incontinence.\nRead more about diagnosing bowel incontinence.\nIn many cases, with the right treatment, a person can maintain normal bowel function throughout their life.\nTreatment will often depend on the cause and how severe it is, but possible options include:\n- lifestyle and dietary changes to relieve constipation or diarrhoea\n- exercise programmes to strengthen the muscles that control the&nbsp;bowel\n- medication to control diarrhoea and constipation\n- surgery, of which there are a number of different options\nIncontinence products, such as anal plugs and disposable pads, can be used until your symptoms are better controlled.\nEven if&nbsp;it isn&#8217;t possible to&nbsp;cure your&nbsp;bowel incontinence, symptoms&nbsp;should&nbsp;improve significantly.\nRead more about treating bowel incontinence.\nBowel incontinence is usually caused by a physical problem with the parts of the body that control the bowel.\nThe&nbsp;most common problems are:\n- problems with the rectum –&nbsp;the rectum is unable to retain poo properly until it&#8217;s time to go to the toilet\n- problems with the sphincter muscles – the muscles at the bottom of the rectum don&#8217;t work properly\n- nerve damage –&nbsp;the nerve signals sent from the rectum don&#8217;t reach the brain\nThese problems are explained in more detail below.\nIt&#8217;s important to discuss any bowel problems with your GP as there&#8217;s a small chance they could be a sign of a more serious condition, such as bowel cancer.\nConstipation is a leading cause of bowel incontinence.\nIn cases of severe constipation, a large, solid stool can become stuck in the rectum. This is known as faecal impaction. The stool then begins to stretch the muscles of the rectum, weakening them.\nWatery stools can leak around the stool and out of the bottom, causing bowel incontinence. This is called overflow incontinence and&nbsp;happens most commonly in elderly people.\nRepeated straining caused by constipation or faecal impaction can also lead to rectal prolapse, when part of your lower intestine falls out of place and protrudes from your bottom. Rectal prolapse may also lead to bowel incontinence.\nIt&#8217;s difficult for the rectum to hold liquid stools (diarrhoea), so people with diarrhoea (particularly recurring diarrhoea) can develop bowel incontinence.\nConditions that can cause recurring diarrhoea include:\n- Crohn&#8217;s disease – inflammation of the digestive system\n- irritable bowel syndrome – a condition that causes a range of digestive problems, such as diarrhoea and bloating\n- ulcerative colitis – inflammation of the large bowel\nThese conditions can also cause scarring of the rectum, which can lead to bowel incontinence.\nHaemorrhoids (piles) are enlarged blood vessels inside or around the bottom (the rectum and anus). Symptoms include discomfort, itching, bleeding or a lump hanging down outside of the anus.\nIn severe cases, haemorrhoids may lead to bowel incontinence.\nThe sphincter muscles at the bottom of the rectum control the bowel. Bowel incontinence happens if these muscles become weakened or damaged.\nChildbirth is a common cause of damage to the sphincter muscles and a leading cause of bowel incontinence. During a vaginal birth, the sphincter muscles can become stretched and damaged, particularly as a result of a forceps delivery. Other causes include a large baby, the baby being born with the back of their head facing the mother&#8217;s back (occipitoposterior position) and a long labour.\nSphincter muscles can also become damaged through injury, or damage from bowel or rectal surgery.\nBowel incontinence can also be caused by a problem with the nerves connecting the brain and the rectum. A nerve problem can mean your body is unaware of stools in your rectum, and may make it difficult for you to control your sphincter muscles.\nDamage to these nerves is related to a number of conditions, including:\n- diabetes\n- multiple sclerosis (a condition of the central nervous system)\n- stroke\n- spina bifida (birth defects that affect the development of the spine and nervous system)\nAn injury to these nerves, such as a spinal injury, can also lead to bowel incontinence.\nIn some cases, bowel incontinence may result from a health condition such as dementia or a severe learning disability that causes the person to lose bowel control.\nA physical disability can also make it difficult to get to the toilet in time.\nYour GP will begin by asking you about the pattern of your symptoms and other related issues, such as your diet.\nYou may find this embarrassing, but it&#8217;s important to answer as honestly and fully as you can to&nbsp;make sure&nbsp;you receive the most suitable treatment. Let your doctor know about:\n- any changes in your bowel habits&nbsp;lasting for more than a few weeks\n- rectal bleeding\n- stomach pains\n- any&nbsp;changes to&nbsp;your diet\n- any medication you&#8217;re taking\nYour GP will usually carry out a physical examination. They&#8217;ll look at your anus and the surrounding area to check for damage and carry out&nbsp;a rectal examination,&nbsp;inserting&nbsp;a gloved finger into your bottom.\nA rectal examination&nbsp;will show whether constipation is the cause, and check for&nbsp;any tumours in your rectum. Your GP may ask you to squeeze your rectum around their finger to assess how well the muscles in your anus are working.\nDepending on the results, your GP may refer you for further tests.\nDuring an&nbsp;endoscopy, the inside of your rectum (and in some cases your lower bowel) is examined using a long, thin flexible tube with a light and video camera at the end (endoscope). Images can also&nbsp;be taken of the inside of your body.\nThe endoscope&nbsp;checks whether there&#8217;s any obstruction, damage or inflammation in your rectum.\nAn&nbsp;endoscopy isn&#8217;t painful, but&nbsp;it can feel uncomfortable, so you may be given a sedative to relax you.\nAnal manometry helps to assess how well the muscles and nerves in and around your rectum are working.\nThe test uses a device that looks like a small thermometer with a balloon attached to the end.&nbsp;It&#8217;s inserted into your rectum and the balloon is inflated. It may feel unusual, but it&#8217;s not uncomfortable or painful.\nThe device is attached to a machine, which measures pressure readings taken from the balloon.\nYou&#8217;ll be asked to squeeze, relax and push your rectum muscles at certain times. You may also be asked to push the balloon out of your rectum in the same way you push out a stool. The pressure-measuring machine gives an idea of how well your muscles are working.\nIf the balloon is inflated to a relatively large size but you don&#8217;t feel any sensation of fullness, it may mean there are problems with the nerves in your rectum.\nAn&nbsp;ultrasound scan can be used to create a detailed picture of the inside of your anus. Ultrasound scans are particularly useful in detecting underlying damage to the sphincter muscles.\nDefecography is a test used to study&nbsp;how you&nbsp;pass stools. It can also be useful in detecting signs of obstruction or prolapse that haven&#8217;t been discovered during a rectal examination.\nDuring this test, a liquid called barium is placed into your rectum. The barium helps make it easier to&nbsp;highlight problems using an X-ray. Once the barium is in place, you&#8217;ll be asked to pass stools in the usual way while scans are taken.\nThis test is occasionally carried out using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner instead of an X-ray.\nTreatment for bowel incontinence depends on underlying cause and the pattern of your symptoms.\nTrying the least intrusive treatments first, such as dietary changes and exercise programmes, is often recommended.\nMedication and surgery are usually only considered if other treatments haven&#8217;t worked.\nYou may find it helpful to use continence products until your bowel incontinence is better controlled. Most continence products are available for free on the NHS.\nAnal plugs are one way to prevent involuntary soiling. An anal plug is made of foam and designed to be inserted into your bottom. However, they can be uncomfortable and they&#8217;re not really a long term solution.\nIf the plug comes into contact with moisture from the bowel, it expands and prevents leakage or soiling. Anal plugs can be worn for up to 12 hours, after which time they are removed using an attached string.\nDisposable body pads are contoured pads that soak up liquid stools and protect your skin. They can be used in cases of mild bowel incontinence.\nSingle-use silicone inserts, which form a seal around the rectum until your next bowel movement, are also being investigated as a treatment option for moderate to severe bowel incontinence.\nYour local NHS continence service can offer help and advice about continence products, and you don&#8217;t usually need a referral from your GP to make an appointment. These clinics are staffed by nurses who specialise in continence treatment.\nWear trousers or skirts that are easy to undo and have elasticated waistbands rather than buttons.\nDisability Rights UK&nbsp;offers access to 9,000 disabled toilets around the UK with a Radar NKS key.&nbsp;The key costs £4.50 and is only sold to people who require use of toilet facilities due to a disability or health condition.\nBowel incontinence associated with diarrhoea or constipation can often be controlled by making changes to your diet.\nIt may be beneficial&nbsp;to keep a food diary to record the effect of your diet on your symptoms.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has published dietary advice for managing diarrhoea in cases of irritable bowel syndrome. These guidelines can also be applied to people with diarrhoea associated with bowel incontinence.\nThe advice from NICE includes the following:\n- limit fibre intake from wholegrain breads, bran, cereals, nuts and seeds (except golden linseeds)\n- avoid skin, pips and pith from fruit and vegetables\n- limit fresh and dried fruit to 3&nbsp;portions a day and&nbsp;fruit juice to 1&nbsp;small glass a day (make up the recommended ‘5&nbsp;a day’ with vegetables)\n- limit how often you have fizzy drinks&nbsp;and drinks containing caffeine\n- avoid foods high in fat, such as chips, fast foods and burgers\nA high-fibre diet is usually recommended for most people with constipation-associated bowel incontinence. Your GP can tell you if a high-fibre diet is suitable for you.\nFibre can soften stools, making them easier to pass. Foods that are high in fibre include:\n- fruit and vegetables\n- beans\n- wholegrain rice\n- wholewheat pasta\n- wholemeal bread\n- seeds, nuts and oats\nDrink plenty of fluids because this can help to soften your stools and make them easier to pass.\nPelvic floor muscle training is a type of exercise programme used to treat cases of bowel incontinence caused by weakness in the pelvic floor muscles.\nA therapist, usually a physiotherapist or specialist nurse, will teach you a range of exercises. The goal of pelvic floor muscle training is to strengthen any muscles that may have been stretched and weakened.\nYou&#8217;ll probably be required to carry out the exercises 3&nbsp;times a day, for 6&nbsp;to 8&nbsp;weeks. After this time, you should notice an improvement in your symptoms.\nCheck with your health professional before trying these at home.\nFirst, pretend you&#8217;re trying to hold in a bowel movement. You should feel the muscles around your anus tighten.\nNext, sit, stand, or lie in a comfortable position with your legs slightly apart.\nSqueeze&nbsp;your pelvic floor&nbsp;muscles for as long as you can, then relax. Repeat 5&nbsp;times.\nSqueeze the muscles as hard as you can, then relax. Repeat 5&nbsp;times.\nSqueeze the muscles quickly, then relax. Repeat 5&nbsp;times.\nIf you find these exercises&nbsp;too difficult, try fewer repetitions at first and build them up. If they get too easy, try doing more repetitions. You can do the exercises without anyone knowing about them, so they should be easy to fit into your daily routine.\nBowel retraining is a type of treatment for people with reduced sensation in their rectum as a result of nerve damage, or for those who have recurring episodes of constipation.\nThere are 3&nbsp;goals in bowel retraining:\n- to improve the consistency of your stools\n- to establish a regular time for you to empty your bowels\n- to find ways of stimulating your bowels to empty themselves\nChanges to your diet usually improve stool consistency (see above).\nEstablishing a regular time to empty your bowels means&nbsp;finding the most convenient time when you can&nbsp;go to the toilet without being rushed.\nWays to stimulate bowel movements can differ from person to person. Some people find a hot drink and meal can help. Others may need to stimulate their anus using their finger.\nBiofeedback is a type of bowel retraining exercise that involves placing a small electric probe into your bottom.\nThe sensor relays detailed information about the movement and pressure of the muscles in your rectum to an attached computer.\nYou&#8217;re then asked to perform a series of exercises designed to improve your bowel function. The sensor checks that you&nbsp;are performing the exercises in the right way.\nMedication can be used to help treat soft or loose stools or constipation associated with bowel incontinence.\nLoperamide&nbsp;is a&nbsp;medicine widely&nbsp;used to treat diarrhoea. It works by slowing down the movement of stools through the digestive system, allowing more water to be absorbed from the stools. Loperamide can be prescribed in low doses to be taken regularly over a long period of time.\nLaxatives&nbsp;are used to treat constipation. They&#8217;re a type of medicine that helps you to pass stools. Bulk-forming laxatives are usually recommended.&nbsp;These help your stools to retain fluid. This means they&#8217;re less likely to dry out, which can lead to faecal impaction.\nRectal irrigation or enemas&nbsp;are used when bowel incontinence is caused by faecal impaction and other treatments have failed to remove the impacted stool from the rectum.\nThese procedures involve&nbsp;a small tube that is placed into your anus. A special solution is then used to wash out your rectum.\nSurgery is usually only recommended after all other treatment options have been tried.\nThe main surgical treatments used on the NHS are sphincteroplasty and sacral nerve stimulation. Other treatments – such as tibial nerve stimulation, endoscopic heat therapy and artificial sphincter surgery – can also be used, but their availability on the NHS is limited.\nAn operation called a colostomy is more widely available on the NHS, but it&#8217;s only used if other treatments are unsuccessful.\nA sphincteroplasty is an operation to repair damaged sphincter muscles. The surgeon removes some of the muscle tissue and the muscle edges are overlapped and sewn back together. This provides extra support to the muscles, which makes them stronger.\nSacral nerve stimulation is a treatment used for people with weakened sphincter muscles.\nElectrodes are inserted under the skin in the lower back and connected to a pulse generator. The generator releases pulses of electricity that stimulate the sacral nerves, which causes&nbsp;the sphincter and pelvic floor muscles to work more effectively.\nAt&nbsp;first, the pulse generator is located outside your body. If the treatment is effective, the pulse generator will be implanted deep under the skin in your back.\nThe most commonly reported complications of the procedure are infection at the site of surgery and technical problems with the pulse generator, which require additional surgery to correct.\nRead the NICE guidelines on Sacral nerve stimulation for faecal incontinence.\nTibial nerve stimulation is a fairly new treatment for bowel incontinence.\nA fine needle is inserted into the tibial nerve just above the ankle and an electrode is placed on the foot.&nbsp;A mild electric current is passed through the needle to stimulate the tibial nerve. It&#8217;s not known exactly how this treatment works, but it&#8217;s thought to work in a similar way to sacral nerve stimulation.\nNICE concludes that the procedure appears to be safe, although there are still uncertainties about how well it works.\nRead the NICE guidelines on Treating faecal incontinence by stimulating the tibial nerve.\nBulking agents, such as collagen or silicone, can be injected into the muscles of the sphincter and rectum to strengthen them.\nThe use of bulking agents in this way is a fairly new technique, so there&#8217;s little information about their long-term effectiveness and safety.\nYou should discuss the possible advantages and disadvantages of this type of treatment in full with your treatment team before deciding whether to proceed.\nRead the NICE guidelines on Treating faecal incontinence with injectable bulking agents.\nEndoscopic radiofrequency (heat) therapy is a fairly new treatment for bowel incontinence.\nHeat energy is applied to the sphincter muscles through a thin probe, to encourage scarring of the tissue. This helps tighten the muscles and helps to control bowel movements.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)&nbsp;recently produced guidelines on this procedure.&nbsp;NICE concluded that the procedure appears to be safe, although there are still uncertainties about how well it works.\nAs well as the uncertainties surrounding this procedure, it is also expensive. Therefore, it is usually only used on the NHS during clinical trials.\nRead the NICE guidelines on Treating faecal incontinence using endoscopic radiofrequency therapy.\nAn artificial sphincter may be implanted if you have bowel incontinence caused by a problem with your sphincter muscles.\nThis operation involves placing a circular cuff under the skin around the anus.&nbsp;The cuff is filled with fluid and sits tightly around the anus, keeping it closed.\nA tube is placed under the skin from the cuff to a control pump. In&nbsp;men, the pump is placed near the testicles, in&nbsp;women it’s placed near the vagina. A special balloon is placed into the tummy, and this is&nbsp;connected to the control pump by tubing that runs under the skin.\nThe&nbsp;pump&nbsp;is activated by pressing a button located under the skin. This drains the fluid from the cuff into the balloon, so your anus opens and you&nbsp;can pass stools. When you are finished, the fluid slowly refills the cuff and the anus closes.\nThe use of an artificial sphincter is a&nbsp;relatively new procedure, so there isn&#8217;t much good-quality information about&nbsp;its long-term effectiveness and safety.\nPossible problems&nbsp;include infection, injury during surgery and the cuff becoming dislodged. In some cases, further surgery is required to correct problems.\nRead the NICE guidelines on Treating faecal incontinence with an artificial sphincter inserted through a cut in the abdomen.\nA&nbsp;colostomy is usually only recommended if other surgical treatments are unsuccessful.\nA colostomy is a surgical procedure in which your colon (lower bowel) is cut and brought through the wall of your stomach to create an artificial opening. Your stools can then be collected in a bag, known as a colostomy bag, which is attached to the opening."

        "disease": "Bowel polyps",
        "description": "Bowel polyps are small growths on the inner lining of the colon (large bowel) or rectum. They are common, affecting 15% to 20% of the UK population, and don&#8217;t usually cause symptoms.\nPolyps are usually less than 1cm in size, although they can grow up to several centimetres. There are various forms:\n- some are a tiny raised area or bulge, known as&nbsp;a sessile polyp\n- some&nbsp;look like a grape on a stalk, known as a pedunculated polyp\n- some take the form of many tiny bumps clustered together\nBowel polyps&nbsp;are not usually cancerous, although&nbsp;if they&#8217;re discovered they&#8217;ll need to be removed, as some will eventually turn into cancer if left untreated.\nSome people just develop one polyp, while others may have a few.&nbsp;They tend to occur in people over the age of 60.\nBowel polyps are caused by an abnormal production of cells. The lining of the bowel constantly renews itself, and a faulty gene can cause the cells in the bowel lining to grow more quickly.\nThere may be a family tendency towards developing bowel polyps or bowel cancer.\nMost people with polyps won&#8217;t be aware of them as they produce no symptoms and are often discovered by accident.\nHowever, some larger polyps can cause:\n- a small amount of rectal bleeding&nbsp;(blood in your stool)\n- mucus to be produced when you open your bowels\n- diarrhoea&nbsp;or constipation\n- abdominal pain\nBowel polyps are usually found as a result of a bowel investigation for another reason, such as a sigmoidoscopy (examination of the last part of the bowel) or during screening for bowel cancer.\nIf polyps are found, a colonoscopy or CT colonography&nbsp;is needed to view the whole of the large bowel and remove any polyps.\nThere are several methods for treating polyps, but the most common procedure involves snaring the polyp&nbsp;during a colonoscopy. Snaring is like cutting the polyp off with cheese wire and is painless.\nBoth of the above methods involve passing a flexible instrument called a colonoscope through your bottom and&nbsp;up into your bowel. The colonoscope has a wire with an electric current to either cauterise (burn off) or snare the polyp.\nIn rare cases, polyps may need to be treated by surgically removing part of the bowel. This is usually only done when the polyp has some cell changes or is particularly large.\nAfter the polyp or polyps have been removed, they are sent to specialists in a laboratory, who will inform your consultant if:\n- the polyp has been completely removed\n- there is any risk of it regrowing\n- there is any cancerous change in the polyp\nIf there is a cancerous change in the polyp, you may need further treatment (depending on the degree and extent of change). Your specialist will be able to advise you on this.\nSome people will need further colonoscopies because polyps can recur. Polyps can sometimes run in families. This is uncommon, but&nbsp;means you&#8217;ll need colonoscopy checks at regular intervals.\nYou might be asked to have repeat examinations at intervals of around 3&nbsp;to 5&nbsp;years to catch any further polyps that may develop and potentially turn into bowel cancer."

        "disease": "Brain stem death",
        "description": "Brain stem death is when a person no longer has any brain stem functions, and has permanently lost the potential for consciousness and the capacity to breathe.\nWhen this happens, a ventilator keeps the person&#8217;s heart beating and oxygen circulating through their bloodstream.\nA person is confirmed as being dead when their brain stem function is permanently lost.\nConfirming death used to be straightforward. Death was said to occur when the heart stopped beating and a person was unresponsive and no longer breathing. The lack of oxygen as a result of no blood flow, quickly led to the permanent loss of brain stem function.\nConfirming death is now more complex, because it&#8217;s possible to keep the heart beating after the brain stem has permanently stopped functioning. This can be done by keeping a person on a ventilator, which allows the body and heart to be artificially oxygenated. However, that person won&#8217;t ever regain consciousness or start breathing again.\nOnce the brain stem has permanently stopped functioning, there&#8217;s no way of reversing it and the heart will eventually stop beating, even if a ventilator continues to be used.\nTo save a person&#8217;s family and friends from unnecessary suffering, once there&#8217;s clear evidence that brain death has occurred, the person will be disconnected from the ventilator.\nThe brain stem is the lower part of the brain that&#8217;s connected to the spinal cord (part of the central nervous system in the spinal column).\nThe brain stem is responsible for regulating most of the body&#8217;s automatic functions that are essential for life. These include:\n- breathing\n- heartbeat\n- blood pressure\n- swallowing\nThe brain stem also relays information to and from the brain to the rest of the body, so it plays an important role in the brain’s core functions, such as consciousness, awareness and movement.\nAfter brain death, it&#8217;s not possible for someone to remain conscious.\nBrain death can occur when the blood and/or oxygen supply to the brain is stopped. This can be caused by:\n- cardiac arrest – when the heart stops beating and the brain is starved of oxygen\n- heart attack – a serious medical emergency that occurs when the blood supply to the heart is suddenly blocked\n- stroke – a serious medical emergency that&nbsp;happens&nbsp;when the blood supply to the brain is blocked or interrupted\n- blood clot – a blockage in a blood vessel that disturbs or blocks the flow of blood around your body\nBrain death can also occur as a result of:\n- a&nbsp;severe head injury\n- a brain haemorrhage\n- infections, such as encephalitis\n- a&nbsp;brain tumour&nbsp;\nThere&#8217;s a difference between brain death and a&nbsp;vegetative state, which can occur after extensive brain damage.\nSomeone in a vegetative state can show signs of wakefulness – for example, they may open their eyes, but not respond to their surroundings.\nIn rare cases, a person may demonstrate some sense of response that can be detected using a brain scan, but not be able to interact with their surroundings.\nHowever, the important difference between brain death and a vegetative state is that someone in a vegetative state still has a functioning brain stem, which means that:\n- some form of consciousness may exist\n- breathing unaided is usually possible&nbsp;\n- there&#8217;s a slim chance of recovery, because the brain stem&#8217;s core functions may be unaffected\nA&nbsp;person who is brain dead has no chance of recovery, because their body is unable to survive without artificial support.\nAlthough rare, a few things can make it appear as though someone is brain dead.\nThese include drug overdoses (particularly from barbiturates) and severe&nbsp;hypothermia (where body temperature drops below 28C).\nTherefore, a number of tests are carried out to check that brain death has actually occurred, like shining a torch into both eyes to see if they react to the light.\nAfter brain death has occurred, it may be possible for the person&#8217;s organs and tissue to be used in transplantations. This can often save or improve the lives of others.\nOnly 1% of people die in a way that makes organ donation possible. This means every opportunity for donation is very precious.\nSpecialist nurses will discuss the possibility of donation with families. This&#8217;ll be done in a sensitive way. They&#8217;ll also check the NHS Organ Donor Register to see if the person had recorded a donation decision and share this information with the family. This lets the family know what their loved one wanted. It also means that nurses can check if this was their latest view.\nFurther information about organ and tissue donation\nThere are a number of criteria for diagnosing brain stem death.\nFor a diagnosis of brain stem death to be made:\n- a&nbsp;person must be unconscious and fail to respond to outside stimulation\n- a&nbsp;person&#8217;s heartbeat and breathing can only be maintained using a ventilator\n- there must be clear evidence that serious brain damage has occurred and it can&#8217;t be cured\nBefore testing for brain stem death, doctors must carry out a series of checks to ensure that the symptoms aren&#8217;t being caused by other factors, like:\n- an overdose of illegal drugs, tranquillisers, poisons or other chemical agents\n- an abnormally low body temperature (hypothermia)\n- severe under-activity of the thyroid gland\nOnce these factors have been ruled out, tests are carried out to confirm brain death. The diagnosis of brain death has to be made by two senior doctors. Neither of them can be involved with the hospital&#8217;s transplant team.\nThe doctors will explain the tests to you and they&#8217;ll keep you informed about your loved one&#8217;s condition at all times.\nThe doctors will run a series of tests. Both doctors have to agree on the results for a diagnosis of brain death to be confirmed. The tests are carried out twice to minimise any chance of error.\nThe tests used to determine whether brain stem death has occurred are outlined below:\n- A torch is shone into both eyes to see if they react to the light.\n- The cornea (transparent outer layer of the eye), which is usually very sensitive, is stroked with a tissue or piece of cotton wool to see if the eye&nbsp;reacts.\n- Pressure is applied to the forehead and the nose is pinched to see if there&#8217;s any movement in response.\n- Ice-cold water is inserted into each ear, which would usually cause the eyes to move.\n- A thin, plastic tube is placed down the trachea (windpipe) to see if it&nbsp;provokes gagging or coughing.\n- The person is disconnected from the ventilator for a short period of time to see if they make any attempt to breathe on their own.\nBrain death will be&nbsp;diagnosed&nbsp;if a person fails to respond to all of these tests.\nOccasionally, a person’s limbs or torso (the upper part of the body) may move, even after brain stem death has been diagnosed.\nThese spinal reflex movements are generated by the spinal cord and don&#8217;t involve the brain at all. Therefore, they won&#8217;t affect the diagnosis of brain death."

        "disease": "Brain tumours",
        "description": "A brain tumour is a growth of cells in the brain that multiplies in an abnormal, uncontrollable way. It can either be cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign).\nBrain tumours are graded from 1 to 4 according to their behaviour, such as how fast they grow and how likely they are to&nbsp;grow back after treatment.&nbsp;\n- benign brain tumours&nbsp;are&nbsp;low grade (grade 1 or 2), which means they grow slowly&nbsp;and are less likely to return after treatment\n- malignant brain tumours&nbsp;are&nbsp;high grade (grade 3 or 4) and either start in the brain (primary tumours) or spread into the brain from elsewhere (secondary tumours); they’re more likely to grow back after treatment\nThis page gives general information relevant to both types of brain tumour.&nbsp;\nThe symptoms of a brain tumour vary depending on the exact part of the brain that’s affected. Common symptoms include:\n- severe, persistent&nbsp;headaches\n- seizures (fits)\n- persistent nausea, vomiting and drowsiness\n- mental or behavioural changes, such as memory problems or changes in personality\n- progressive weakness or&nbsp;paralysis on one side of the body, vision problems, or speech problems\nSometimes, you may not have any symptoms to begin with, or they may only develop very slowly over time.\nSpeak to your GP if you&nbsp;have persistent symptoms of a brain tumour. While it’s unlikely to be a tumour, it’s best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis.\nIf your GP is unable to identify a more likely cause of your symptoms, they may refer you to a neurologist for further assessment and tests, such as a brain scan.\nBrain tumours can affect people of any age, including children, although they tend to be more common in older adults.\nMore than 9,000 people are diagnosed with primary&nbsp;brain tumours in the UK each year, of&nbsp;which about half&nbsp;are benign and half are malignant. Many others&nbsp;are diagnosed&nbsp;with secondary brain tumours.\nThe exact reason why some people develop primary brain tumours is unknown, but it’s thought that certain genetic conditions – such as neurofibromatosis type 1 and tuberous sclerosis – and previous radiotherapy to the head increase your risk.\nThe main treatment for most brain tumours is surgery, which aims to remove as much of the abnormal tissue as possible.\nIt’s not always possible to remove the entire tumour, so further treatment with radiotherapy and/or&nbsp;chemotherapy&nbsp;may be necessary to kill any abnormal cells left behind.\nFor most benign tumours, treatment is often&nbsp;successful and a full recovery is possible, although there’s sometimes a small chance the tumour could come back.&nbsp;Regular follow-up appointments will normally be recommended to monitor this.\nThe outlook for malignant tumours is generally less good, although this varies depending on things such as&nbsp;where the tumour is in the brain, your age, and your general health. Unfortunately,&nbsp;a cure is often not possible and most tumours will return after treatment.\nIf a tumour does come back, treatment&nbsp;will aim to relieve your symptoms and prolong life by controlling the growth of the tumour.&nbsp;\nAs well as reading the separate pages on&nbsp;benign brain tumours&nbsp;and malignant brain tumours, you may find the following websites useful sources of information and support:\n- The Brain Tumour Charity\n- Brain Tumour Research\n- Cancer Research UK: Brain tumours&nbsp;\n- Macmillan Cancer Support: Brain tumours"

        "disease": "Brain tumours: Children",
        "description": "Brain tumours are the most common tumours that develop in children. Children of any age may be affected. Boys are affected slightly more often than girls.\nMore children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.\nIt’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer. At times it can feel overwhelming, but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.\nUnderstanding more about the cancer your child has, and the treatments that may be used, can often help parents to cope. Your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information and, if you have any questions, it’s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.&nbsp;\nA tumour in the brain can come from the brain itself (primary), or from another part of the body (secondary). This information is about primary brain tumours.\nSymptoms will depend on the size of the tumour, where it is and how it affects that part of the brain.&nbsp;Symptoms&nbsp;are caused by the pressure inside the head being higher than it should be. A growing tumour may push normal brain out of the way, or block the flow of fluid in the brain. Doctors call this raised intracranial pressure, and it can cause symptoms such as:\n- headaches&nbsp;(often worse in the morning)\n- vomiting (usually in the morning) or feeling sick\n- fits (seizures)\n- feeling very irritated or losing interest in day-to-day things\n- eye problems, such as abnormal eye movements, blurring or double vision feeling very tired much more quickly than usual\n- feeling extremely sleepy (drowsy) for no reason\nBrain tumours can also cause problems with balance and walking, weakness down one side of the body, or changes in behaviour. Some of these symptoms are common even without a brain tumour, and this can cause confusion in the early stages.\nThe brain is contained within the skull, which protects it. Between the brain and the skull, there are 3 layers of membrane called the meninges. These completely cover the brain and spinal cord and help to protect it. Between 2 of these layers is a space that contains a fluid called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which circulates around the brain and spinal cord.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n&nbsp;The main parts of the brain are:\n- the cerebrum – this is at the top of the head and is the largest part of the brain; it’s&nbsp;made up of 2 halves&nbsp;(hemispheres), it controls thinking, learning, memory, problem-solving, emotions and touch, and it also helps us be aware of our body position\n- the cerebellum – this is the back part of the brain, and it controls movement, balance and coordination\n- the brain stem – this connects the brain to the spinal cord and is in the lower part of the brain just above the back of the neck; it controls breathing, body temperature, heart rate and blood pressure, eye movements and swallowing\nKnowing what a test involves can make things a bit easier. The specialist doctor and nurse will explain things but don’t be afraid to ask questions.\nYour doctor will want to hear about the problems your child has had recently, and will examine him or her properly. This will include looking into the back of your child’s eyes with an ophthalmoscope to check for swelling, which can be a sign of raised pressure in the brain. They’ll usually check other things like balance, coordination, sensation and reflexes.\nMost children will have a&nbsp;CT&nbsp;or an&nbsp;MRI scan, which looks in detail at the inside of the brain.\nA CT scan uses&nbsp;X-rays. It’s quick and often is the best first-line investigation, but it does not give as detailed pictures as an MRI. It uses quite a lot of X-rays, and so it is important to make sure we do not use it on too many people if it can be avoided.\nAn MRI scan uses no X-rays, and gives more detailed pictures, but takes much longer. Machines are noisy, and often children cannot lie still long enough to get proper images. It is sometimes necessary to have an anaesthetic for this scan.\nOrdinary X-rays are not usually helpful for brain tumours.\nThese are usually done to make sure it is safe to do an operation, and can also be used to help diagnose certain types of tumour.\nIt’s often necessary for doctors to remove a small part of the tumour (biopsy) to find out exactly what type of tumour it is. It means your child will need to go into hospital for an operation under general anaesthetic. The piece of tumour removed is then examined under a microscope by a specialist doctor called a pathologist.\nA biopsy isn’t always done; it is sometimes better to remove the whole tumour in one operation. In this case, it will be a few days before the exact type of tumour is known.\nSometimes, it may be safer to do the operation in two stages. Part of the tumour might be removed in the first operation and the rest a few days later.\nThere are different types of brain tumours and they are usually named after the type of cells they develop from. The main types are astrocytoma, ependymoma, and medulloblastoma, but there are many other, less common types.\nBrain tumours can be either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous).\nThese remain in the part of the brain that they started in and do not usually spread into other areas. Sometimes it may be difficult to remove a benign tumour, because of where it is and, in this situation, other treatments may be needed.\nThe most common tumour of this type is a low-grade astrocytoma (also called low-grade glioma).\nThese are most likely to cause problems by causing pressure and damage to the areas around them and possibly by spreading to the normal brain tissue close by.\nThese tumours develop from the supporting cells of the brain known as glial cells, and are sometimes also called gliomas.\nThese usually develop in the lower part of the brain, the cerebellum. They may spread to other parts of the brain or into the spinal cord, and treatment must include the whole of this.\nBecause there are different types of brain tumours, treatment will not be the same for everyone. The doctors will look at the type of brain tumour, its size and where it is in the brain before deciding on the best treatment.\nThese are the main treatments used to treat brain tumours. Your child may have one treatment or a combination of treatments.\nUsually, a neurosurgeon will operate to remove as much of the tumour as possible. Operations can be very long. It’s not uncommon for these to be more than 6 or 8 hours.\nSometimes, the fluid in and around the brain does not flow freely, as a result of the tumour or brain swelling. In this case, it may be necessary to place a fine tube (shunt) to drain excess fluid from the brain and into the lining of the tummy area (abdomen). You cannot see the shunt outside the body. Another way of treating this is to create another drainage route for the fluid around the obstruction (called a ventriculostomy).\nAfter the operation, your child may spend some time in an intensive care ward or high dependency unit, so the nurses and doctors can keep a very close eye on them.\nOnce a diagnosis is known, a plan to treat any tumour left behind can be made. For benign tumours, there may be no further treatment, but for some, radiotherapy or chemotherapy will be required.\nRadiotherapy treats cancer by using high energy radiation beams. These are exactly the same as visible light, but instead of reflecting from the surface, the energy passes inside the body, where it causes damage to tumour cells.\nRadiotherapy is delivered extremely carefully, using machines linked to the MRI scans of your child’s brain. The process usually takes a few minutes each time, but often needs to continue for 5 or 6 weeks.\nSometimes more specialised types of radiotherapy may be used. Your child’s oncologist will explain more about this.\nChemotherapy uses drugs to get rid of cancer cells. Chemotherapy is given into the veins, and sometimes as a liquid or tablets by mouth. Treatment is often quite prolonged, with periods of time in hospital and gaps when you will be able to return home. This part of the treatment is planned by an oncologist.\nThe specialist doctor and nurse will explain your child’s treatment and answer your questions so that you understand what is involved.\nYour child may need to take medicines for a while to reduce or control the symptoms of the brain tumour:\nThese are medicines that reduce swelling and inflammation in the brain and can help with symptoms.\nThese are medicines that help prevent fits, which can be a problem before or after operations on the brain. They may only be necessary for a short period, but sometimes are needed for longer.\nYour child’s doctor and specialist nurse will explain more about what to expect. Always let them know about any side effects your child is having. Many side effects can be well controlled or made easier.\nBoth radiotherapy and chemotherapy can cause&nbsp;hair loss. Your child’s hair will usually grow back again after chemotherapy, although it may not after radiotherapy.\nTiredness is very common with both treatments and may continue for weeks after chemotherapy or radiotherapy finishes.\nRadiotherapy and chemotherapy may make your child feel sick. This can usually be controlled well with anti-sickness drugs, which the oncologist will prescribe for your child.\nChemotherapy can increase the risk of infection. It’s&nbsp;important to contact the oncologist or specialist nurse straight away if your child has a temperature, any signs of infection or suddenly feels unwell.\nRadiotherapy can cause a mild form of sunburn. The skin may become red, flaky or sore if your child has fair skin and may become darker and flaky if your child has dark skin. You’ll be given advice on looking after the skin in the treated area.\nTrials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. It’s important to realise that a clinical trial is not an ‘experiment’, and your doctor will always offer you what is believed to be the best available treatment. Clinical trials are usually offered to explore ways of making new improvements to treatment, beyond what is already known.\nSpecialist doctors carry out many trials for brain tumours. If appropriate, your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial, and will answer any questions you have. Written information is often provided to help explain things.\nTaking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide if it is right for your child. You can also join a trial, and then withdraw if you change your mind at a later date.\nSometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child’s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The&nbsp;Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group&nbsp;(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.\nAfter treatment is over, your child will be seen regularly by specialists. This is to check their progress and how well they’re recovering from treatment. It is also to check that they don’t have any long-term problems from treatment.\nYou can contact your child’s specialist doctor or nurse at any time if you have any worries about their health.\nSometimes treatments may cause possible long-term side effects that may develop later. Your child’s oncologist or specialist nurse will explain the possible risk of any long-term effects in your child’s situation. Children are monitored for any long-term problems following treatment so that they can be picked up and managed early on.\nAs a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time.\nYour child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience of cancer.\nFurther information and advice if your child has cancer"

        "description": "This section is for teenagers and young adults. It’s about the brain and different types of brain tumour.\nAny illness to do with your brain can be scary. Understanding a bit more about how the brain works might help.\nThe brain and the spinal cord make up the central nervous system (CNS). The brain is the ‘control centre’ which coordinates most body functions. It is inside the skull, which protects it. The spinal cord is made up of nerves that run down the spine. It passes messages between the brain and the rest of the body.\nThe brain and the spinal cord are covered by 3 thin layers of tissue called the meninges. Between&nbsp;2 of these layers is a fluid called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The meninges and CSF help to protect the brain and spinal cord.\nThe main parts of the brain are the:\n- cerebrum\n- cerebellum\n- brain stem\n- pituitary gland\nThis is at the top of the head and is the largest part of the brain. It’s made up of&nbsp;2 halves called hemispheres. It controls thinking, learning, memory, problem solving, emotions, and touch. It also makes us aware of our body position.\nThis is at the back of the head, near the middle. It controls movement, balance and coordination.\nThis connects the brain to the spinal cord. It’s in the lower part of the brain, just above the back of the neck. It controls breathing, body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, eye movements and swallowing.\nThis is in the middle of the brain. It makes hormones that control things such as growth, metabolism, periods, and sperm production.\nThere are different types of brain tumour. They are usually named after the type of cells they develop from. Brain tumours can be either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). This information is about both types.\nBenign brain tumours often press on the brain but don’t usually spread into surrounding tissue. They are also less likely to spread around the brain and spinal cord. If they can be removed with an operation they may not cause any more problems. Sometimes it’s difficult to remove a benign tumour because of where it is in the brain. In this case, you might need treatment with chemotherapy or radiotherapy.\nSome benign tumours can cause long-lasting changes. This can be because they increase the pressure inside the brain, or because they press on important areas of the brain.\nMalignant brain tumours can spread from where they started into surrounding brain tissue, causing pressure and problems in those parts of the brain. They can also spread through the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into other parts of the brain or the spinal cord.\nThis information is about tumours that start in the brain, which are called primary brain tumours. Sometimes cancers that start in other parts of the body can spread to the brain. These are known as secondary brain tumours.\nThe types of brain tumour most likely to affect teenagers and young adults are:\n- pituitary tumours\n- gliomas\n- medulloblastomas\n- germ cell tumours\nThese start in cells called glial cells. There are different types of glioma, but the ones that affect younger people are usually astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas and ependymomas. These types of tumour can develop in the brain or in the spinal cord.\nThese are the most common type of glioma.\nAstrocytomas develop from a star-shaped cell called an astrocyte. Oligodendrogliomas look like a fried egg. Sometimes tumours are a mix of both cells. These are called oligoastrocytomas. Doctors group them by how quickly they grow (known as the grade of the tumour). They can tell the grade from how the cells look under a microscope.\nThese are a rarer type of glioma. They develop from the spinal cord, and from cells that line the fluid-filled spaces (ventricles) in the brain. These tumours can spread to&nbsp;other parts of the brain and spine through the CSF.\nThese are usually benign tumours that grow in the pituitary gland. They are mostly grouped into pituitary adenomas and craniopharyngiomas.\nSome cause too many or too few hormones to be produced in the body. They very rarely spread.\nThese usually start in the cerebellum, at the back of the brain. Sometimes they can spread through the CSF, or very rarely to other parts of the body. They start from cells that haven’t properly developed yet, and are sometimes called primitive neuroectodermal tumours (PNET).\nThis type of tumour is rare. They develop from very early cells called germ cells, which have the potential to grow into any type of tissue.\nAlthough germ cell tumours often develop in the ovaries in girls or the testicles in boys, they can also start in other parts of the body, including the brain. They may be non-cancerous or cancerous. They are called by different names depending on what the cells look like under a microscope.\nWe also have more information about:\n- symptoms of brain tumours\n- having tests for brain tumours\n- treatment for brain tumours\nIf you’re looking for information about&nbsp;brain tumours&nbsp;in people of all ages, read our general brain tumours section. We also have information about&nbsp;brain tumours in children.\nThis section on brain tumours is for teenagers and young adults.\nThe symptoms of a brain tumour depend on the size of the tumour and where it is.\nThe tumour can:\n- cause fits\n- affect the messages sent by that part of the brain to other parts of the body\n- cause ‘raised intracranial pressure’&nbsp;– there’s only a certain amount of space in the skull for the brain and as a tumour grows, there can be a rise in pressure in or around the brain\nCommon symptoms of ‘raised intracranial pressure’ are:\n- headaches, which are often worse in the morning\n- vomiting (usually in the morning) or feeling sick\n- fits (seizures)\n- feeling very irritated or losing interest in day-to-day&nbsp;things like friends, school or going out\n- problems with your eyes, such as blurring or seeing double\n- feeling more sleepy or drowsy than usual\n- changes in your balance and walking, or weakness down one side of the body\n- problems with speech\n- personality changes\nThere’s often a simple explanation for many of these symptoms. But if you have any of these or if you’re worried, it’s important to speak to your GP straight away.\nThe cause of most brain tumours is unknown. Research is looking into this all the time.\nYoung people with rare genetic conditions that run in families, such as neurofibromatosis type 1 and neurofibromatosis type 2, have an increased chance of developing a brain tumour.\nMobile phones, power lines and certain viruses have all been suggested as possible causes of brain tumours. There’s been a lot of research into these possible causes, especially mobile phones. But there has been no strong evidence for any of them.\nRemember&nbsp;– nothing you’ve done has caused the tumour.\nIf you think you might have any of the symptoms of a brain tumour, you should go straight to your GP. They&#8217;ll be able to talk to you about your symptoms. They can arrange&nbsp;tests&nbsp;to find out more, or refer you to a specialist doctor.\nWe also have more info about:\n- having tests for brain tumours\n- treatment for brain tumours\n- the brain&nbsp;\nIf you’re looking for information about&nbsp;brain tumours&nbsp;in people of all ages, read our general brain tumours section. We also have information about&nbsp;brain tumours in children.\nThis section on brain tumours is for teenagers and young adults.\nYour GP will examine you and, depending on your symptoms, they may arrange some tests. Or they might send you to hospital straight away to see a doctor who specialises in problems to do with the brain. These doctors are called neurologists or neurosurgeons.\nSometimes a brain tumour is diagnosed after someone has been taken into hospital to check out symptoms that have happened suddenly, like having a fit.\nYou’ll usually be seen at a hospital with a centre or unit specialising in treating brain tumours.\nYour specialist will ask you questions about your symptoms and how you’ve been feeling. They’ll examine the back of your eyes using an instrument with a light on the end of it to check for swelling. Swelling can be a sign of raised pressure in your head.\nThey’ll usually check:\n- your balance\n- your coordination\n- your muscle strength\n- your reflexes\n- whether you can feel pinpricks on areas of your skin\nYou might also have your eyesight and hearing tested.\nYou’ll need to have some more tests before a diagnosis is made. Your doctor will select the most suitable tests for your situation. These tests are important because they help your specialist plan the best treatment for you. Your doctor and specialist nurse will explain things to you, but don’t be afraid to ask questions.\nMacmillan Cancer Support has information on the possible tests, which&nbsp;include:\n- a&nbsp;CT scan&nbsp;or&nbsp;MRI scan&nbsp;– these show a detailed picture of the inside of your head\n- blood tests&nbsp;– these are done to check your general health and sometimes to measure the level of certain chemicals or hormones in your blood\n- lumbar punctures – in this test a small needle is used to collect some fluid from the base of your spine; it&#8217;s sometimes done to look for cancer cells in the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord\n- X-rays&nbsp;– might be taken to check your skull and chest\nDoctors often need to remove a small part of the tumour (biopsy) to find out exactly what type of tumour it is. The piece of tumour that’s removed is looked at under a microscope by a doctor called a pathologist. The operation will be done under&nbsp;general anaesthetic. This is where you are put into a deep sleep. You’ll probably be in hospital for a few days.\nAn&nbsp;MRI&nbsp;or&nbsp;CT scan&nbsp;is used to find the exact position of the tumour. The surgeon makes a small hole in the skull and passes a fine needle through it to remove a piece of the tumour.\nThis is often used to make sure the doctor takes the biopsy from the most appropriate part of the tumour. You will have a head frame fitted that will help guide the surgeon to exactly the right place before they take the biopsy. This is called a stereotactic biopsy.\nHaving tests and waiting for results can be scary. Remember – you don’t have to keep your worries to yourself. Talking about how you feel and getting support from family, friends or your specialist nurse and doctor can make it a bit easier. You could also talk to one of Macmillan&#8217;s&nbsp;cancer support specialists&nbsp;on their free helpline.\nThis information is about having tests for brain tumours. We also have more information about:\n- symptoms of brain tumours\n- treatment for brain tumours&nbsp;\n- the brain\nIf you&#8217;re looking for information about brain tumours in people of all ages, read our general&nbsp;brain tumours&nbsp;section.\nThis section on brain tumours is for teenagers and young adults.\nA team of specialists will plan your treatment. They will talk to you about the best treatment for you.\nIt&#8217;s normal to have a combination of treatments, so you may be seen by different doctors, such as:\n- a neurosurgeon, who specialises in brain operations\n- a neurologist, who treats brain conditions\n- a cancer specialist (oncologist), who treats brain tumours with radiotherapy and chemotherapy\nYou’ll usually see a specialist nurse who looks after people with conditions affecting the brain, or a specialist nurse for teenagers or young adults with cancer. If you have radiotherapy (X-ray treatment) you will be given this treatment by a radiographer.\nThere are different types of brain tumours, so treatment won’t be the same for everyone. Your doctors look at the type of brain tumour you have, its size and where it is in the brain before deciding on the best treatment for you.\nThe main treatments for brain tumours are:&nbsp;\n- surgery&nbsp;– an operation to remove all, or as much as possible, of the tumour&nbsp;\n- radiotherapy&nbsp;– uses high-energy x-rays to treat cancer cells\n- chemotherapy&nbsp;– uses anti-cancer drugs to destroy cancer cells&nbsp;\nYour specialist doctor and nurse will explain your treatment and answer any questions you have. It’s important you understand what’s involved. You’ll probably need some time to talk it through with your family.\nYou might need to take these medicines for a while to reduce or control the symptoms of the brain tumour:\n- steroids, which can reduce swelling or inflammation in the brain and help with symptoms\n- anticonvulsant medicines that help prevent fits (seizures)\nYour surgeon will usually try to remove all, or as much as possible, of the tumour. Before the operation, they will talk to you about what’s involved and the benefits and risks of the operation. It’s important you understand all this, so ask all the questions you want to.\nYou’ll usually be in hospital for a week, sometimes longer. Your doctor or nurse will tell you what to expect before and after the operation as it can be different for everyone.\nBefore the operation you’ll probably need to have some of your hair shaved off. This is done in the anaesthetic room. You may prefer to have all your hair shaved off. You can cover up with a wig or hat while it grows back.\nFor some types of brain tumours, particularly low-grade gliomas, your surgeon might suggest doing an operation while you are awake. This is called an &#8216;awake craniotomy&#8217;. If you need this, you will be given plenty of medication to make sure it doesn&#8217;t hurt.\nSometimes surgery is not needed, or it’s not possible to remove the tumour. Your specialist may think that another treatment would be better for you. They will discuss this with you and you can ask any questions to help you understand your options.\nAfter the operation you are monitored very closely for the first 12 to 24 hours. At first you might be attached to a machine called a ventilator that helps you breathe. Your nurse or doctor will tell you if this is likely to happen.\nYour head might be bandaged and you’ll have a tube draining any extra blood that’s collected around the wound into a plastic bottle. You may also have another tube draining extra cerebrospinal fluid (fluid that surrounds the brain). This is to make sure you don’t get too much pressure building up inside your brain. Your doctor will remove these tubes as soon as it’s safe, usually after a couple of days.\nYou’ll have a drip to give you fluids until you’re eating and drinking again. There may be some swelling and bruising around your face and eyes. This will settle down after a few days.\nWhen you wake up you might have a headache. You’ll be given painkillers regularly until this eases off. Tell your nurse or doctor if you’re in pain so that they can give you something stronger.\nRadiotherapy&nbsp;uses high-energy X-rays to treat cancer cells. It can be used:\n- after the operation to treat any cells that may have been left behind\n- instead of an operation when a brain tumour doesn’t need to be or can’t be removed\n- if a brain tumour comes back after surgery\nFor some brain tumours, it’s normal to treat your spinal cord (the nerves that go from your brain to your body) as well as your brain. Your doctor will tell you if this is the case.\nThere are&nbsp;3 types of radiotherapy that are used to treat brain tumours:\n- photon radiotherapy (given at your local hospital)\n- proton radiotherapy (until 2018/2019 this is given in Switzerland or America)\n- stereotactic radiosurgery/radiotherapy (given at specialist hospitals in the UK)\nYour doctor will discuss with you which treatment would be best.\nYou’ll have your treatment in the radiotherapy department of the hospital. It’s usually given Monday to Friday, with a rest at the weekend. The number of treatments you have will depend on your situation, but it can last from 1 day to 7 weeks.\nYou will have to wear a mask or shell to keep your head as still as possible during radiotherapy treatment. This makes sure treatment is delivered to the exact area each time. Your mask is made before your treatment is planned. You’ll be able to see and breathe properly, but it might feel a bit tight. You only have to wear it for a few minutes at a time. Most people find they get used to it pretty quickly. Let your nurse or radiographer know if you’re worried about this.\nThe treatment only takes a few minutes. It isn’t painful, but you need to lie very still. You’ll be on your own in the room but you can talk to the radiographer through an intercom. In some hospitals you can have music playing while you have your treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nThe side effects you might have will depend on the type of radiotherapy you’re having and how long it lasts for. Your doctor and specialist nurse will tell you more about what to expect. Always let them know about any side effects you’re having. There’s usually something they can do to make things easier.\nYour hair in the treatment area will start to thin and fall out shortly after your treatment starts. Your doctor or nurse can show you where you will&nbsp;lose your hair.\nLosing your hair can be scary and really upsetting. There are lots of ways to cover up with hats, bandannas, baseball caps, scarves, or wigs until it grows back. Getting a shorter haircut before it starts to fall out sometimes makes it a little easier to cope with.\nIt usually starts to grow back within 3 months of finishing treatment. Hair may grow back with a slightly different colour and texture and might not be as thick as before.\nAlthough hair loss is usually temporary, for some people it can be permanent. Your specialist will usually be able to tell you if this is likely. This can be hard to deal with and you’ll be given advice and support to help you cope.\nYou might get some skin changes&nbsp;– a bit like sunburn&nbsp;– in the area being treated, usually after 3 to 4 weeks of treatment. At first it can be dry and itchy. If you’ve got pale skin it might get red. If you’ve got darker skin it can get darker. You should wash and dry the skin gently using non-perfumed soap and use only the moisturiser that the radiographer gives you. The radiographer or specialist nurse will give you advice on looking after your skin.\nYou may feel really tired towards the end of your treatment and for a few weeks after it has finished. This gradually improves after a few weeks. Try to get plenty of rest. It’s also a good idea to do some gentle exercise if you can, like taking short walks. This helps to give you more energy and keep your muscles toned.\nLet your doctor know if this is a problem. They can prescribe anti-sickness medicines to help.\nIt’s important to tell your doctor if you have headaches. They can prescribe pain&nbsp;relief for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nDuring and after treatment, you might find your symptoms get a bit worse before they get better. This can be scary but it’s usually a reaction to the radiotherapy. It doesn’t mean the radiotherapy hasn’t worked or that the tumour has got worse. If it happens, let your doctor or nurse know.\nSide effects that happen months or years after treatment has finished are called late (long-term) effects. These depend on the area of the brain treated. They can include patches of hair loss, worse concentration, memory changes and difficulty learning new things, reduced hormones, increased risk of a stroke, and a second tumour.\nYou’ll be seen regularly for follow-up appointments and your doctors will be checking you for any late effects of treatment. Your doctors will explain more about this to you.\nChemotherapy&nbsp;is the use of special anti-cancer drugs to destroy tumour cells. You might have chemotherapy:\n- to shrink a tumour to make it easier to remove with surgery\n- when it’s not possible to remove the tumour completely with surgery\n- during radiotherapy to make the tumour more sensitive to radiation\n- after radiotherapy or surgery to reduce the chance of the tumour coming back (adjuvant chemotherapy)\n- when a brain tumour has come back after treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nMacmillan has information on the different cancer treatments and drugs that can be used, such as:\n- lomustine (CCNU)\n- procarbazine\n- vincristine\n- cisplatin or carboplatin\n- temozolomide (Temodal®)\n- cyclophosphamide\n- ifosfamide\n- etoposide\nThe information on these drugs is written for people of all ages, not just for young people. There are lots of other drugs that are used and your doctor or nurse can tell you more about this.\nChemotherapy can be given as a single drug or in combination with others. They can be given by injection into a vein (intravenously) or as tablets. Occasionally chemotherapy is given directly into the spine (intrathecal chemotherapy) or into the brain through a special device (ommaya reservoir).&nbsp;\nAnother way of giving chemotherapy is for the surgeon to place a wafer containing chemotherapy in the area of the brain where the tumour was removed during the surgery. As the wafer dissolves, the chemotherapy drug is slowly released into the area of the brain that needs treatment.| &nbsp;\nChemotherapy causes side effects that usually get better when treatment is over.&nbsp;\nYou need to let your doctor or nurse know immediately if you have signs of an infection like feeling hot and shivery. This is because you can become unwell quite quickly while you are on chemotherapy.\nThis is a common side effect so it’s important to get plenty of rest. Try to balance rest with some gentle exercise like short walks if you can. This helps give you more energy and keeps your muscles toned.\nYou’ll be given anti-sickness medicines to take regularly. Let your nurse or doctor know if the ones you’re taking aren’t working for you.\nIf you lose your hair it will usually start to grow back again after your treatment stops.\nSome chemotherapy drugs can affect your fertility. Your doctor should discuss this with you before treatment begins.&nbsp;\nYour doctor and nurse will tell you more about the side effects to expect depending on the chemotherapy you have. Let your doctor or nurse know about any side effects as there’s often something that can be done to control them.\nAs part of your treatment for a brain tumour you’ll probably be given drugs called steroids. You may also be given some anticonvulsant drugs to prevent fits.\nSteroids help reduce the swelling that often surrounds a brain tumour. Although they don’t treat the tumour itself, they can improve symptoms and make you feel better. Steroids are often given before and after surgery, and sometimes during or after radiotherapy and chemotherapy.\nIt’s important to take steroids as your doctor tells you and not to suddenly stop them. If you take steroids for more than 2 weeks, it’s important to tell your doctor about them if you are unwell (for example an infection) over the next 6 months. This is because you may need an extra course of steroids.\nIf you take steroids for some time, you may have some temporary side effects. These can include:\n- weight gain\n- a change in the shape of your face (making it more rounded)\n- indigestion\n- slightly more risk of getting an infection\n- mood changes (feeling ‘hyper’ or overactive or feeling low)\n- increase in the sugar level in your blood&nbsp;– your blood or urine may be tested to check for this\nSide effects can be hard to cope with, especially with all the other stuff you have to deal with. Remember&nbsp;– the side effects will gradually get better when the steroids are stopped, and in the meantime there are lots of people who can support you.\nTumours in the brain can sometimes cause fits. Anticonvulsant drugs can help prevent them. You might be prescribed these before surgery, or to take on a more long-term basis. Your doctors will tell you about any side effects of these drugs.\nWe also have more information about:\n- symptoms of brain tumours&nbsp;\n- having tests for brain tumours\n- the brain\nIf you&#8217;re looking for information about brain tumours in people of all ages,&nbsp;read our general&nbsp;brain tumours&nbsp;section."

        "disease": "Breast cancer (female)",
        "description": "Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in the UK.\nMost women who get it (8 out of 10) are over 50, but younger women, and in rare cases, men can also&nbsp;get breast cancer.\nIf it&#8217;s treated early enough, breast cancer can be prevented from spreading to other parts of the body.\nThe breasts are made up of fat, connective tissue and thousands of tiny glands called lobules, which produce milk. When a woman has a baby, the milk is delivered to the nipple through tiny tubes called ducts, which allow her to breastfeed.\nThe body is made up of billions of tiny cells, which usually grow and multiply in an orderly way. New cells are only produced when and where they&#8217;re needed. In cancer, this orderly process goes wrong and cells begin to grow and multiply uncontrollably.\nRead more about the causes of breast cancer\nBreast cancer can have a number of symptoms, but the first noticeable symptom is usually a lump or area of thickened breast tissue.\nMost breast lumps aren&#8217;t cancerous, but it&#8217;s always best to have them checked by your doctor. You should also speak to your GP if you notice any of the following:\n- a change in the size or shape of one or both breasts\n- discharge from either of your nipples&nbsp;(which may be streaked with blood)\n- a lump or swelling in either of your armpits\n- dimpling on the skin of your breasts\n- a rash on or around your nipple\n- a change in the appearance of your nipple, such as becoming sunken into your breast\nBreast pain alone isn&#8217;t a symptom of breast cancer.\nLearn more about the symptoms of breast cancer\nAfter examining your breasts, your GP may refer you to a specialist breast cancer clinic for further tests.&nbsp;This might include a mammography (breast screening)&nbsp;or a biopsy.\nRead more about&nbsp;breast screening&nbsp;and&nbsp;how breast cancer is diagnosed\nThere are several different types of breast cancer, which can develop in different parts of the breast. Breast cancer is often divided into non-invasive and invasive types.\nNon-invasive breast cancer is also known as cancer or carcinoma in situ. This cancer is found in the ducts of the breast and hasn&#8217;t developed the ability to spread outside the breast.\nThis form of cancer rarely shows as a lump in the breast that can be felt, and is usually found on a mammogram. The most common type of non-invasive cancer is ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).\nInvasive cancer has the ability to spread outside the breast, although this doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean it has spread.\nThe most common form of breast cancer is invasive ductal breast cancer, which develops in the cells that line the breast ducts. Invasive ductal breast cancer accounts for about 80% of all&nbsp;breast cancer cases and is sometimes called &#8216;no special type&#8217;.\nOther less common types of breast cancer include invasive lobular breast cancer, which develops in the cells that line the milk-producing lobules, inflammatory breast cancer and Paget&#8217;s disease of the breast.\nIt&#8217;s possible for breast cancer to spread to other parts of the body, usually through the lymph nodes (small glands that filter bacteria from the body) or the bloodstream. If this happens, it&#8217;s known as &#8216;secondary&#8217; or &#8216;metastatic&#8217; breast cancer.\nThere&#8217;s a good chance of recovery if breast cancer is detected in its early stages. For this reason, it&#8217;s vital that women check their breasts regularly for any changes and always get any changes examined by their GP.\nMammographic screening (where X-ray&nbsp;images of the breast are taken) is the best available method of detecting an early breast lesion. However, you should be aware that a mammogram might fail to detect some breast cancers. It might also increase your chances of having extra tests and interventions, including surgery.\nWomen with a higher-than-average risk of developing breast cancer may be offered screening and genetic testing for the condition.\nAs the risk of breast cancer increases with age, all women who are 50&nbsp;to 70 years old are invited for breast cancer screening every 3 years.\nWomen over 70 are also entitled to screening and can arrange an appointment through their GP or local screening unit.\nRead more about&nbsp;breast screening\nIf cancer is detected at an early stage, it can be treated before it spreads to nearby parts of the body.\nBreast cancer is treated using a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Surgery is usually the first type of treatment you&#8217;ll have, followed by chemotherapy or radiotherapy or, in some cases, hormone or biological treatments.\nThe type of surgery and the treatment you have afterwards will depend on the type of breast cancer you have. Your doctor will discuss the best treatment plan with you.\nIn a&nbsp;small proportion of women, breast cancer is discovered after it&#8217;s spread to other parts of the body (metastasis). Secondary cancer, also called advanced or metastatic cancer, isn&#8217;t curable, so the aim of treatment is&nbsp;to achieve remission (symptom relief).\nRead more about treating breast cancer\nAs the causes of breast cancer aren&#8217;t fully understood, it&#8217;s not possible to know if it can be prevented altogether.\nIf you&#8217;re at increased risk of developing the condition, some treatments are available to reduce the risk.\nStudies have looked at the link between breast cancer and diet and, although there are no definite conclusions, there are benefits for women who maintain a healthy weight, exercise regularly and who have a low intake of saturated&nbsp;fat and alcohol.\nIt&#8217;s been suggested that regular exercise can reduce your risk of breast cancer by as much as a third. If you&#8217;ve been through the menopause, it&#8217;s particularly important that you&#8217;re not overweight or obese. This is because being overweight or obese causes more oestrogen to be produced, which can increase the risk of breast cancer.\nRead more about preventing breast cancer\nBeing diagnosed with breast cancer can affect daily life in many ways,&nbsp;depending on what stage&nbsp;it&#8217;s at and what treatment you&#8217;re having.\nHow women cope with their diagnosis and treatment varies from person to person. You can be reassured that there are several forms of support available, if you need it. For example:\n- your&nbsp;family and&nbsp;friends can be a powerful support system\n- you can communicate with other people in the same situation\n- find out as much as possible about your condition\n- don&#8217;t try to do too much or overexert yourself\n- make time for yourself\nRead more about living with breast cancer\nThe first symptom of breast cancer most women notice is a lump or an area of thickened tissue in their breast.\nMost&nbsp;breast lumps (90%) aren&#8217;t cancerous, but it&#8217;s always best to have them checked by your doctor.\nYou should speak to your GP if you notice any of the following:\n- a lump or area of thickened tissue in either breast\n- a change in the size or shape of one or both breasts\n- discharge from either of your nipples&nbsp;(which may be streaked with blood)\n- a lump or swelling in either of your armpits\n- dimpling on the skin of your breasts\n- a rash on or around your nipple\n- a change in the appearance of your nipple, such as becoming sunken into your breast\nBreast pain alone isn&#8217;t a symptom of breast cancer.\nRead further information:\n- Breast Cancer Now: Signs and symptoms of breast cancer\n- Cancer Research UK: Symptoms of breast cancer\n- Macmillan Cancer Support: Signs and symptoms of breast cancer\nIt&#8217;s important to be breast aware,&nbsp;so you can pick up any changes as soon as possible. Get to know what is normal for you. For instance, your breasts may look or feel different at different times of your life. This will make it much easier to spot&nbsp;potential problems.\nRead further information:\n- Breast Cancer Now:&nbsp;Touch, Look, Check\n- Breast Cancer Now:&nbsp;Signs and symptoms of breast cancer\nThe causes of breast cancer aren&#8217;t fully understood, making it difficult to say why one woman may develop breast cancer and another may not.\nHowever, there are risk factors that are&nbsp;known to affect your likelihood of developing breast cancer. Some of these you can&#8217;t do anything about, but there are some you can change.\nThe risk of developing breast cancer increases with age. The condition is most common among women over 50 who have been through the menopause. About 8 out of 10 cases of breast cancer occur in women over 50.\nAll women who are 50&nbsp;to 70 years of age should be screened for breast cancer every 3 years as part of the NHS Breast Screening Programme. Women over the age of 70 are still eligible to be screened and can arrange this through their GP or local screening unit.\nRead more about breast screening\nIf you have close relatives who have had breast cancer or ovarian cancer, you may have a higher risk of developing breast cancer. However, because breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, it&#8217;s possible for it to occur in more than one family member by chance.\nMost cases of breast cancer aren&#8217;t hereditary (they don&#8217;t run in families), but particular genes, known as BRCA1 and BRCA2, can increase your risk of developing both breast and ovarian cancer. It&#8217;s possible for these genes to be passed on from a parent to their child. A third gene (TP53) is also associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.\nIf you have, for example, 2 or more close relatives from the same side of your family, such as your mother, sister or daughter, who have had breast cancer under the age of 50, you may be eligible for surveillance for breast cancer or for genetic screening to look for the genes that make developing breast cancer more likely. If you&#8217;re worried about your family history of breast cancer, discuss it with your GP.\nRead about predictive genetic tests for cancer risk genes\nIf you&#8217;ve previously had breast cancer or early non-invasive cancer cell changes in breast ducts, you have a higher risk of developing it again, either in your other breast or in the same breast again.\nA&nbsp;benign breast lump doesn&#8217;t mean&nbsp;you have breast cancer, but certain types of lump may slightly increase your risk of developing it. Certain benign changes in your breast tissue, such as atypical ductal hyperplasia (cells growing abnormally in ducts), or lobular carcinoma in situ (abnormal cells inside your breast lobes), can make getting breast cancer more likely.\nYour breasts are made up of thousands of tiny glands (lobules), which produce milk. This glandular tissue contains a higher concentration of breast cells than other breast tissue, making it denser. Women with dense breast tissue may have a higher risk of developing breast cancer because there are more cells that can become cancerous.\nDense breast tissue can also make a breast scan (mammogram) difficult to read, because it makes any lumps or areas of abnormal tissue harder to spot. Younger women tend to have denser breasts. As you get older, the amount of glandular tissue in your breasts decreases and is replaced by fat, so your breasts become less dense.\nThe female hormone, oestrogen,&nbsp;can sometimes stimulate breast cancer cells and cause them to&nbsp;grow. The ovaries, where your eggs are stored, begin to produce oestrogen when you start&nbsp;puberty, to regulate your periods.\nYour risk of developing breast cancer may rise slightly with the amount of oestrogen&nbsp;your body is exposed to. For example, if you started your&nbsp;periods at a young age and experienced the&nbsp;menopause at a late age, you&#8217;ll have been exposed to oestrogen over a longer period of time. In the same way, not having children, or having children later in life, may slightly increase your risk of developing breast cancer because your exposure to oestrogen is uninterrupted by pregnancy.\nIf you&#8217;ve experienced the menopause and are overweight or obese, you may be more at risk of developing breast cancer. This is thought to be linked to the amount of oestrogen in your body, because being overweight or obese after the menopause causes more oestrogen to be produced.\nIf you&#8217;re taller than average, you&#8217;re more likely to develop breast cancer than someone who&#8217;s shorter than average.&nbsp;The reason for this isn&#8217;t fully understood, but it may be due to interactions between genes, nutrition and hormones.\nYour risk of developing breast cancer can increase with the amount of alcohol you drink.&nbsp;\nCertain medical procedures that use radiation, like X-rays&nbsp;and computerised tomography (CT) scans, may slightly increase your risk of developing breast cancer.\nIf you had&nbsp;radiotherapy to your chest area for Hodgkin lymphoma&nbsp;when you were a child, you should have already received a written invitation from the Department of Health for a consultation with a specialist to discuss your increased risk of developing breast cancer. Speak to your GP if you weren&#8217;t contacted, or if you didn&#8217;t attend a consultation.\nIf you currently need radiotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma, your specialist should discuss the risk of breast cancer before your treatment begins.\nHormone replacement therapy (HRT) is associated with a slightly increased risk of developing breast cancer. Both combined HRT and oestrogen-only HRT can increase your risk of developing breast cancer, although the risk is slightly higher if you take combined HRT.\nRead further information:\n- Breast Cancer Now: Breast cancer causes\n- Macmillan Cancer Support: Risk factors for breast cancer\nIf you have suspected breast cancer, either&nbsp;because of&nbsp;your symptoms or because your mammogram has shown an abnormality, you&#8217;ll be referred to a specialist breast clinic for further tests.\nThe tests you&#8217;ll receive at the breast clinic depend on your current symptoms, your age, and the results of the initial examination you&#8217;ll have when you arrive. Many people don&#8217;t need any further tests after the initial examination.\nMost of the time you can expect to spend up to 2 hours at the breast clinic.\nIf you have symptoms and have been referred by your GP, you&#8217;ll meet a specialist who&#8217;ll examine you to determine if you need further tests.&nbsp;\nIf you&#8217;re under&nbsp;40 years of age, the specialist&nbsp;may suggest you only have a breast ultrasound scan. This is because younger women have denser breasts, which means a mammogram isn&#8217;t as effective as an ultrasound&nbsp;for diagnosing breast disease.\nIf you have a mammogram, it will produce an&nbsp;X-ray of your breasts. You may also need an ultrasound scan.\nUltrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your breasts, showing any lumps or abnormalities. Your doctor may also suggest a breast ultrasound if they need to know whether a lump in your breast is solid or contains liquid.\nRead more about breast screening\nA&nbsp;biopsy is where a sample of tissue cells is taken from your breast and tested to see if it&#8217;s cancerous. You may also need a scan and a needle test on lymph nodes in your armpit (axilla) to see whether these are also affected.\nBiopsies can be taken in different ways, and the type you have will depend on what your doctor knows about your condition.&nbsp;Different methods of&nbsp;carrying out&nbsp;a biopsy are discussed below.\nNeedle aspiration may be used to test a sample of your breast cells for cancer or to drain a benign cyst (a small fluid-filled lump). Your doctor will use a small needle to extract a sample of cells, without removing any tissue.\nNeedle biopsy is the most common type of biopsy. A sample of tissue is taken from a lump in your breast using a large needle. You&#8217;ll have a local anaesthetic, which means you&#8217;ll be awake during the procedure, but your breast will be numb.\nYour doctor may suggest that you have a guided needle biopsy (usually guided by ultrasound or X-ray, but sometimes MRI is used) to obtain a more precise and reliable diagnosis of cancer and to distinguish it from any non-invasive change, particularly ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).\nVacuum-assisted biopsy, also known as a mammotome biopsy, is another type of biopsy. During the procedure, a needle&nbsp;is attached to a gentle suction tube, which helps to&nbsp;obtain the sample and clear any bleeding from the area.\nRead further information:\n- Breast Cancer Now:&nbsp;What happens at a breast clinic appointment? \n- Breast Cancer Now: Your pathology results\n- Macmillan Cancer Support: Breast cancer\nIf a diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed, more tests will be needed to determine the stage and grade of the cancer, and to work out the best method of treatment.&nbsp;\nIf&nbsp;your&nbsp;cancer was detected through the NHS Breast Screening Programme, you&#8217;ll have further tests in the screening centre before being referred for treatment.&nbsp;\nComputerised tomography (CT) scans, or chest X-ray and liver ultrasound scans, may be needed to check whether the cancer has spread to your lungs or liver. An MRI scan of the breast may be needed to clarify or to assess the extent of the condition within the breast.\nIf your doctor thinks that the cancer could have spread to your bones, you may need a bone scan. Before having a bone scan, a substance containing a small amount of radiation, known as an isotope, will be injected into a vein in your arm. This will be absorbed into your bone if it&#8217;s been affected by cancer. The affected areas of bone will show up as highlighted areas on the bone scan, which is carried out using a special camera.\nYou&#8217;ll also need tests that show whether the cancer will respond to specific types of treatment. The results of these tests can give your doctors a more complete picture of the type of cancer you have and how best to treat it. The types of test you could be offered are discussed below.\nIn some cases, breast cancer cells can be stimulated to grow by hormones that occur naturally in your body, such as oestrogen and progesterone.\nIf this is the case, the cancer may be treated by stopping the effects of the hormones, or by lowering the level of these hormones in your body. This is known as &#8216;hormone therapy&#8217;.\nDuring&nbsp;a hormone receptor test, a sample of cancer cells will be taken from your breast and tested to see if they respond to either oestrogen or progesterone. If the hormone is able to attach to the cancer cells (using a hormone receptor), they&#8217;re known as &#8216;hormone receptor positive&#8217;.\nWhile hormones can encourage the growth of some types of breast cancer, other types are stimulated by a protein called&nbsp;human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2).\nThese types of cancer can be diagnosed using a HER2 test, and treated with medication to block the effects of HER2. This is known as &#8216;biological&#8217; or &#8216;targeted&#8217; therapy.\nWhen your breast cancer is diagnosed, the doctors will give it a stage. The stage describes the size of the cancer and how far it has spread.\nDuctal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is sometimes described as stage 0. Other stages of breast cancer describe invasive breast cancer:\n- stage 1 – the tumour measures less than 2cm, the lymph nodes in the armpit aren&#8217;t affected, and there are no signs that the cancer has spread elsewhere in the body\n- stage 2 – the tumour measures 2 to 5cm or the lymph nodes in the armpit are affected, or both, and there are no signs that the cancer has spread elsewhere in the body\n- stage 3 – the tumour measures&nbsp;2 to 5cm and may be attached to structures in the breast, such as skin or surrounding tissues, the lymph nodes in the armpit are affected but&nbsp;there are no signs that the cancer has spread elsewhere in the body\n- stage 4 – the tumour is of any size and the cancer has spread to other parts of the body (metastasis)\nThis is a simplified guide. Each stage is divided into further categories: A, B and C. If you&#8217;re not sure what stage you have, ask your doctor.\nThe TNM staging system may also be used to describe breast cancer, as it can provide accurate information about the diagnosis. T describes the size of the tumour, N describes whether cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, and M gives an indication of whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.\nThe grade describes the appearance of the cancer cells.\n- low grade (G1) – the cells, although abnormal, appear to be growing slowly\n- medium grade (G2) – the cells look more abnormal than low-grade cells\n- high grade (G3) – the cells look even more abnormal and are more likely to grow quickly\nRead further information:\n- Cancer Research UK: TNM staging for breast cancer\n- Cancer Research UK: Stages and grades of breast cancer\nSurgery is usually the first type of treatment for breast cancer. The type of surgery you undergo will depend on the type of breast cancer you have.\nSurgery is usually followed by chemotherapy or radiotherapy or, in some cases, hormone or biological treatments. Again, the treatment you&#8217;ll have will depend on&nbsp;your type of breast cancer.\nYour doctor will discuss the most suitable treatment&nbsp;plan with you. Chemotherapy or hormone therapy will sometimes be the first treatment.\nMost breast cancers are discovered in the condition&#8217;s early stages. However, a small proportion of women discover that they have breast cancer after it&#8217;s spread to other parts of the body (known as metastasis).\nIf this is the case, the type of treatment you have may be different. Secondary cancer, also called &#8216;advanced&#8217; or &#8216;metastatic&#8217; cancer, isn&#8217;t curable and treatment aims to achieve remission (where the cancer shrinks or disappears, and you feel normal and able to enjoy life to the full).\nRead further information about&nbsp;secondary breast cancer\nThere are 2 main types of breast cancer surgery. They are:\n- surgery to remove the cancerous lump (tumour), known as breast-conserving surgery\n- surgery to remove the whole breast, which is called a mastectomy\nIn many cases, a mastectomy can be followed by reconstructive surgery to try to recreate a bulge to replace the breast that was removed.\nStudies have shown that breast-conserving surgery followed by radiotherapy is as successful as total mastectomy at treating early-stage breast cancer.\nBreast-conserving surgery ranges from a lumpectomy or wide local excision, where&nbsp;just the tumour and a little surrounding breast tissue is removed, to a partial mastectomy or quadrantectomy, where&nbsp;up to a quarter of the breast is removed.\nIf you have breast-conserving surgery, the amount of breast tissue you have removed will depend on the:\n- type of cancer you have&nbsp;\n- size of the tumour and where it is in your breast\n- amount of surrounding tissue that needs to be removed\n- size of your breasts\nYour surgeon will always remove an area of healthy breast tissue around the cancer, which will be tested for traces of cancer. If there&#8217;s no cancer present in the healthy tissue, there&#8217;s less chance that the cancer will reoccur. If cancer cells are found in the surrounding tissue, more tissue may need to be removed from your breast.\nAfter having breast-conserving surgery, you will usually be offered radiotherapy to destroy any remaining cancer cells.\nA mastectomy is the removal of all the breast tissue, including the nipple. If there are no obvious signs that the cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, you may have a mastectomy, where your breast is removed, along with a sentinel lymph node biopsy.\nIf the cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, you will probably need more extensive removal (clearance) of lymph nodes from the axilla (under your arm).\nBreast reconstruction is surgery to make a new breast shape that looks as much as possible like your other breast. Reconstruction can be carried out at the same time as a mastectomy (immediate reconstruction), or it can be carried out later (delayed reconstruction). It can be done either by inserting a breast implant or by using tissue from another part of your body to create a new breast.\nRead further information about&nbsp;breast reconstruction\nTo find out if the cancer has spread, a procedure called a sentinel lymph node biopsy&nbsp;may be carried out.\nThe sentinel lymph nodes are the first lymph nodes that the cancer cells reach if they spread. They&#8217;re part of the lymph nodes under the arm (axillary lymph nodes). The position of the sentinel lymph nodes varies, so they&#8217;re identified using a combination of a radioisotope and a blue dye.\nThe sentinel lymph nodes are examined in the laboratory to see if there are any cancer cells present. This provides a good indicator of whether the cancer has spread.\nIf there are cancer cells in the sentinel nodes, you may need further surgery to remove more lymph nodes from under the arm.\nRadiotherapy uses controlled doses of radiation to kill cancer cells. It&#8217;s usually given after surgery and chemotherapy to kill any remaining cancer cells.\nIf you need radiotherapy, your treatment will begin about a month after your surgery or chemotherapy, to give your body a chance to recover. You&#8217;ll probably have radiotherapy sessions 3 to 5 days a week, for 3 to 6 weeks. Each session will only last a few minutes.\nThe type of radiotherapy you have will depend on your cancer and surgery type. Some women may not need to have radiotherapy at all. The types available are:&nbsp;\n- breast radiotherapy – after breast-conserving surgery, radiation is applied to the whole of the remaining breast tissue\n- chest wall radiotherapy – after a mastectomy, radiotherapy is applied to the chest wall\n- breast boost – some women may be offered a boost of high-dose radiotherapy in the area where the cancer was removed; however, the boost may affect the appearance of the breast, particularly if you have large breasts, and can sometimes have other side effects, including hardening of the breast tissue (fibrosis)\n- radiotherapy to the lymph nodes – where radiotherapy is aimed at the armpit (axilla) and the surrounding area to kill any cancer that may be present in the lymph nodes\nThe side effects of radiotherapy include:\n- irritation and darkening of the skin on your breast, which may lead to sore, red, weepy skin\n- fatigue (extreme tiredness)\n- lymphoedema&nbsp;(excess fluid build-up in your arm caused by blockage of the lymph nodes under your arm)\nRead further information about&nbsp;radiotherapy for breast cancer\nChemotherapy involves using anti-cancer (cytotoxic) medication to kill the cancer cells. It&#8217;s usually used after surgery to destroy any cancer cells that haven&#8217;t been removed. This is called adjuvant chemotherapy.\nIn some cases, you may have chemotherapy before surgery, which is often used to shrink a large tumour. This is called neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.\nSeveral different medications are used for chemotherapy and three are often given at once. The choice of medication and the combination will depend on the type of breast cancer you have and how much it&#8217;s spread.\nChemotherapy is usually given as an outpatient treatment, which means&nbsp;you won&#8217;t have to stay in hospital overnight. The medications are usually given through a drip straight into the blood through a vein.\nIn some cases, you may be given tablets that you can take at home. You may have chemotherapy sessions once every 2 to 3 weeks, over a period of 4 to 8 months, to give your body a rest in between treatments.\nThe main side effects of chemotherapy are caused by their influence on normal, healthy cells, such as immune cells. Side effects include:\n- infections\n- loss of appetite\n- nausea and vomiting\n- tiredness\n- hair loss\n- sore mouth\nMany side effects can be prevented or controlled with medicines that your doctor can prescribe.\nChemotherapy medication can also stop the production of oestrogen in your body, which is known to encourage the growth of some breast cancers.\nIf you haven&#8217;t experienced the menopause, your periods may&nbsp;stop while you&#8217;re undergoing chemotherapy treatment. After you&#8217;ve finished the course of chemotherapy, your ovaries should start producing oestrogen again.\nHowever, this doesn&#8217;t always happen and you may enter an early menopause. This is more likely in women over 40 years old, because&nbsp;they&#8217;re closer to menopausal age. Your doctor will discuss with you the impact that any treatment will have on your fertility.\nChemotherapy for secondary breast cancer\nIf your breast cancer has spread beyond the breast and lymph nodes to other parts of your body, chemotherapy won&#8217;t cure the cancer, but it may shrink the tumour, relieve your symptoms and help lengthen your life.\nRead further information about&nbsp;chemotherapy for breast cancer\nSome breast cancers are stimulated to grow by the hormones oestrogen or progesterone, which are found naturally in your body.\nThese types of cancer are known as hormone-receptor-positive cancers. Hormone therapy works by lowering the levels of hormones in your body or by stopping their effects.\nThe type of hormone therapy you&#8217;ll have will depend on the stage and grade of your cancer, which hormone it&#8217;s sensitive to, your age, whether you&#8217;ve experienced&nbsp;the menopause and what other type of treatment you&#8217;re having.\nYou&#8217;ll probably have hormone therapy after surgery and chemotherapy, but it&#8217;s sometimes given before surgery to shrink a tumour, making it easier to remove.\nHormone therapy may be used as the only treatment for breast cancer if your general health prevents you from having surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy.\nIn most cases, you&#8217;ll need to take hormone therapy for up to five years after&nbsp;having surgery. If your breast cancer isn&#8217;t sensitive to hormones, hormone therapy will have no effect.\nTamoxifen stops oestrogen from binding to oestrogen-receptor-positive cancer cells. It&#8217;s taken every day as a tablet or liquid. It can cause several side effects, including:\n- tiredness\n- changes to your periods\n- nausea and vomiting\n- hot flushes\n- aching joints\n- headaches&nbsp;\n- weight gain\nIf you&#8217;ve&nbsp;experienced the menopause, you may be offered an aromatase inhibitor. This type of medication works by blocking aromatase, a substance that helps produce oestrogen in the body after the menopause. Before the menopause, oestrogen is made by the ovaries.\nThree aromatase inhibitors may be offered. These are&nbsp;anastrozole, exemestane and letrozole. These are taken as a tablet once a day. Side effects include:\n- hot flushes and sweats\n- lack of interest in sex (loss of libido)\n- nausea and vomiting\n- tiredness\n- aching joints and bone pain\n- headaches\n- skin rashes\nIn women who haven&#8217;t&nbsp;experienced the menopause, oestrogen is produced by the ovaries. Ovarian ablation or suppression stops the ovaries working and producing oestrogen.\nAblation can be carried out using surgery or radiotherapy. It&nbsp;stops the ovaries working permanently and means you&#8217;ll experience the menopause early.\nOvarian suppression involves using a medication called goserelin, which is a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonist (LHRHa). Your periods will stop while you&#8217;re taking it, although they should start again once your treatment is complete.\nIf you&#8217;re&nbsp;approaching the menopause (around the age of 50), your periods may not start again after you stop taking goserelin.\nGoserelin is taken as an injection once a month and can cause menopausal side effects, including:\n- hot flushes and sweats\n- mood swings\n- trouble sleeping\nRead further information about&nbsp;hormone therapy\nSome breast cancers are stimulated to grow by a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). These cancers are called HER2-positive. Biological therapy works by stopping the effects of HER2 and by helping your immune system to fight off cancer cells.\nIf you have high levels of the HER2 protein and are able to have biological therapy, you&#8217;ll probably be prescribed a medicine called trastuzumab. Trastuzumab, also known by the brand name Herceptin,&nbsp;is usually used after chemotherapy.\nTrastuzumab is a type of biological therapy known as a monoclonal antibody. Antibodies occur naturally in your body and are made by your immune system to destroy harmful cells, such as viruses and bacteria. The trastuzumab antibody targets and destroys cancer cells that are HER2-positive.\nTrastuzumab is usually given intravenously, through a drip. It&#8217;s also sometimes available as an injection under the skin (a subcutaneous injection).\nYou will have the treatment in hospital. Each treatment session takes up to one hour and the number of sessions you need will depend on whether you have early or more advanced breast cancer. On average, you&#8217;ll need a session once every three weeks for early breast cancer, and weekly sessions if your cancer is more advanced.\nTrastuzumab can cause side effects, including heart problems. This means that it&#8217;s not suitable if you have a heart problem, such as angina, uncontrolled&nbsp;high blood pressure (hypertension) or heart valve disease. If you need to take trastuzumab, you&#8217;ll have&nbsp;regular tests on your heart to make sure it&#8217;s not causing any problems.\nOther side effects of trastuzumab may include:\n- an initial allergic reaction to the medication, which&nbsp;can cause nausea, wheezing, chills and fever\n- diarrhoea\n- tiredness\n- aches and pains\nA great deal of progress has been made in breast cancer treatment, and more women now live longer and have fewer side effects from treatment.\nThese advances were discovered in clinical trials, where new treatments and treatment combinations are compared with standard ones.\nAll cancer trials in the UK are carefully overseen to ensure they&#8217;re worthwhile and safely conducted. In fact, participants in clinical trials can do better overall than those&nbsp;in routine care.\nIf you&#8217;re asked to take part in a trial, you&#8217;ll be given an information sheet and, if you want to take part, you&#8217;ll be asked to sign a&nbsp;consent form. You can refuse or withdraw from a clinical trial without it affecting your care.\nRead further information:\n- Breast Cancer Now: Clinical trials\n- Against Breast Cancer:&nbsp;Our research\nDealing with cancer can be a huge challenge, for both patients and their families. It can cause emotional and practical difficulties. Many women have to cope with the removal of part or all of a breast, which can be very upsetting.\nIt often helps to talk about your feelings or other difficulties with a trained counsellor or therapist. You can ask for this kind of help at any stage of your illness.\nThere are various ways to find help and support. Your hospital doctor, specialist nurse or GP can refer you to a counsellor. If you&#8217;re feeling depressed, talk to your GP. A course of antidepressant drugs may help, or your GP can arrange for you to see a counsellor or psychotherapist.\nIt can help to talk to someone who&#8217;s been through the same thing as you. Many organisations have helplines and online forums. They can also put you in touch with other people who&#8217;ve had cancer treatment.\nRead further information:\n- Breast Cancer Now: Support for you\n- Macmillan Cancer Support:&nbsp;Online community\nComplementary therapies are holistic therapies that can promote physical and emotional wellbeing. They&#8217;re given alongside conventional treatments and include relaxation techniques, massage, aromatherapy and acupuncture.\nComplementary therapy&nbsp;can help some women cope with diagnosis and treatment, and provide&nbsp;a break&nbsp;from the treatment plan.\nYour hospital or breast unit may be able to provide access to complementary therapies or suggest where you can&nbsp;get them. It&#8217;s important to speak to your breast cancer specialist nurse about any complementary therapy you wish to use, to make sure it doesn&#8217;t&nbsp;interfere with your conventional treatment.\nRead further information about&nbsp;complementary therapies\nMost women with breast cancer have an operation as part of their treatment. Getting back to normal after surgery can take some time. It&#8217;s important to take things slowly and give yourself time to recover.\nDuring this time, avoid lifting things – for example, children or heavy shopping bags – and avoid heavy housework. You may also be advised not to drive.\nSome other treatments, particularly radiotherapy&nbsp;and chemotherapy, can make you very tired. You may need to take a break from some of your normal activities for a while. Don&#8217;t&nbsp;be afraid to ask for practical help from family and friends.\nAfter your treatment has finished, you&#8217;ll be invited for regular check-ups, usually every 3 months for the first year.\nIf you&#8217;ve had early breast cancer, your healthcare team will agree a care plan with you after your treatment has finished. This plan contains the details of your follow-up. You will receive a copy of the plan, which will also be sent to your GP.\nDuring the check-up, your doctor will examine you and may carry out&nbsp;blood tests or&nbsp;X-rays&nbsp;to see how your cancer is responding to treatment. You should also be offered a mammogram every year for the first 5 years after your treatment.\nAlthough it&#8217;s rare, your treatment for breast cancer may cause new problems, such as:\n- pain and stiffness in your arms and shoulders may occur after surgery, and the skin in these areas may be tight\n- lymphoedema&nbsp;(a build-up of excess lymph fluid which causes swelling) – this may occur&nbsp;if surgery or radiotherapy damages the lymphatic drainage system in the armpit\nTalk to your healthcare team if you experience these or any other long-term effects of treatment.\nRead further information:\n- Breast Cancer Now:&nbsp;Life after treatment\n- Breast Cancer Now: Lymphoedema\n- Cancer Research UK: Follow up after breast cancer treatment\nA diagnosis of breast cancer may change how you think about your body. All women react differently to the bodily changes that happen as a result of breast cancer treatment. Some women react positively, but others find it more difficult to cope. It&#8217;s important to give yourself time to come to terms with any changes to your body.\nRead further information:\n- Breast Cancer Now: Coping with breast cancer emotionally\n- healthtalk: Body image and breast cancer\n- Macmillan Cancer Support:&nbsp;Changes to your appearance and body image\nAlthough most cases of breast cancer occur in women over 50 who have experienced&nbsp;the menopause, some younger women have to cope with early menopause brought on by cancer treatment.\nSymptoms can include hot flushes, vaginal dryness and loss of sexual desire. Talk to your healthcare team about any symptoms you have and they&#8217;ll be able to help.\nRead further information:\n- Breast Cancer Now: Fertility and breast cancer treatment\n- Cancer Research UK: Breast cancer and menopausal symptoms\n- Macmillan: Menopausal symptoms and cancer treatment\nA breast prosthesis is an artificial breast, which can be worn inside your bra to replace the breast that&#8217;s been removed.\nSoon after a mastectomy, you&#8217;ll be given a lightweight foam breast to wear until the area affected by surgery or radiotherapy has healed. After it&#8217;s healed, you&#8217;ll be offered a silicone prosthesis. Prostheses come in many different shapes and sizes, and you should be able to find one that suits you.\nRead further information:\n- Breast Cancer Now: Your body after breast cancer treatment\n- Cancer Research UK: False breast shape (prosthesis) after breast cancer surgery\nIf you didn&#8217;t have immediate breast reconstruction (carried out at the time of a mastectomy), you can have reconstruction later. This is&nbsp;called a delayed reconstruction.\nThere are 2 main methods of breast reconstruction – reconstruction using your own tissue and reconstruction using an implant. The type that&#8217;s most suitable for you will depend on many factors, including the treatment you&#8217;ve had, any ongoing treatment and the size of your breasts. Talk to your healthcare team about which reconstruction is suitable for you.\nRead further information about&nbsp;breast reconstruction\nIt&#8217;s not always easy to talk about cancer, either for you or your family and friends. You may sense that some people feel awkward around you or avoid you.\nBeing open about how you feel and what your family and friends can do to help may put them at ease. However, don&#8217;t be afraid to tell them that you need some time to yourself, if that&#8217;s what you need.\nRead further information:\n- Breast Cancer Now: Telling family and friends about your breast cancer\n- Macmillan Cancer Support: Talking about your cancer\n- Healthtalk: How breast cancer affects families\nBreast cancer and its treatment can affect your sex life. It&#8217;s common for women to lose interest in sex after breast cancer treatment. Your treatment may leave you feeling very tired. You may feel shocked, confused or depressed about being diagnosed with cancer. You may be upset by the changes to your body or grieve the loss of your breasts or, in some cases, your fertility.\nIt&#8217;s understandable that you may not feel like having sex while coping with all this. Try to share your feelings with your partner. If you have problems with sex that aren&#8217;t getting better with time, you may want to speak to a counsellor or sex therapist.\nRead further information:\n- Breast Cancer Now: Sex and breast cancer treatment\n- Cancer Research UK: Life after breast cancer surgery\n- Macmillan Cancer Support: Sex and side effects of cancer treatment\nIf you have to reduce or stop work because of your cancer, you may find it difficult to cope financially.\nIf you have cancer or you&#8217;re caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to financial support, for example:\n- if you have a job but can&#8217;t work because of your illness, you&#8217;re entitled to Statutory Sick Pay from your employer\n- if you don&#8217;t have a job and can&#8217;t work because of your illness, you may be entitled to Employment and Support Allowance\n- if you&#8217;re caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to Carer’s Allowance\n- you may be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home, or if you have a low household income\nFind out what help is available to you as soon as possible. The social worker at your hospital will be able to give you the information you need.\nYour GP or nurse may be able to answer any questions you have about your cancer or treatment. You may find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor or psychologist, or to someone at a specialist helpline. Your GP surgery will have information on these.\nSome people find it helpful to talk to other people who have&nbsp;breast cancer, either at a local support group or in an internet chatroom.\nRead further information:\n- Breast Cancer Now: Support for you\n- Macmillan Cancer Support: Online community\nAs the causes of breast cancer aren&#8217;t fully understood, it&#8217;s not known if it can be prevented altogether.\nSome treatments are available to reduce the risk in women who have a higher risk of developing the condition than the general population.\nRegular exercise&nbsp;and a&nbsp;healthy, balanced&nbsp;diet are recommended for all women because they can help prevent many conditions, including heart disease, diabetes and many forms of cancer.\nRegular exercise can reduce your risk of developing breast cancer. If you have been through the menopause, it&#8217;s particularly important that you&#8217;re not overweight or obese. This is because these conditions cause more oestrogen to be produced, which can increase the risk of breast cancer.\nStudies have shown that women who breastfeed are statistically less likely to develop breast cancer than those who don&#8217;t. The reasons aren&#8217;t fully understood, but it could be because women don&#8217;t ovulate as regularly while they&#8217;re&nbsp;breastfeeding and oestrogen levels remain stable.\nIf you have an increased risk of developing breast cancer, treatment is available to reduce your risk.\nYour level of risk&nbsp;is determined by factors such as your age, your family&#8217;s medical history and the results of genetic tests.\nYou will usually be referred to a specialist genetics service if it&#8217;s thought you have an increased risk of breast cancer.&nbsp;Healthcare professionals working at these services&nbsp;should discuss treatment options with you.\nThe 2 main treatments are surgery to remove the breasts (mastectomy) or medication.\nA&nbsp;mastectomy is surgery to remove the breasts. It can be used&nbsp;to treat breast cancer and reduce the chances of developing the condition in the small number of women from high-risk families.\nBy removing as much breast tissue as possible, a mastectomy can&nbsp;reduce&nbsp;your risk of breast cancer by up to 90%.\nHowever, like all operations, there&#8217;s a risk of complications, and having your breasts removed can have a significant effect on your body image and sexual relationships.\nIf you want to, you can usually choose&nbsp;to have breast reconstruction either during the mastectomy operation, or at a later date. During breast reconstruction surgery, your original breast shape is recreated using either&nbsp;breast implants or tissue from elsewhere in your body.\nAn alternative is to use&nbsp;breast prostheses. These are&nbsp;artificial breasts&nbsp;that can be worn inside your bra.\nRead more about your body and your breasts after treatment\nIn 2013, the&nbsp;National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) announced that 2 medications, called tamoxifen and raloxifene, would be available on the NHS&nbsp;for women who have an increased risk of developing breast cancer.\nEither&nbsp;tamoxifen or raloxifene can be used in women who&#8217;ve been through the menopause, but only tamoxifen should be used in women who haven&#8217;t.\nThese&nbsp;medications may not be suitable if in the past you&#8217;ve had blood clots or&nbsp;womb cancer, or if you have an increased risk of developing these problems in the future.\nWomen who&#8217;ve already had a mastectomy to remove both breasts&nbsp;won&#8217;t be offered these medications, because their risk of developing breast cancer is very small.\nA&nbsp;course of treatment with tamoxifen or raloxifene will usually involve taking a tablet every day for 5 years.\nRaloxifene can cause side effects including&nbsp;flu-like symptoms, hot flushes and leg cramps. Side effects of tamoxifen can include hot flushes and sweats, changes to your&nbsp;periods, and nausea and vomiting.\nYour chances of giving birth to a child with birth defects increase while you&#8217;re taking tamoxifen, so&nbsp;you&#8217;ll be advised to stop taking it at least 2 months before trying for a baby. The medication can also increase your risk of blood clots, so you should stop taking it 6 weeks before having any planned surgery.\nTamoxifen and raloxifene aren&#8217;t currently licensed for the purpose of reducing the risk of breast cancer in women with an increased&nbsp;risk of developing the condition. However, they can still be used if you understand the benefits and risks, and your doctor believes the treatment will be helpful.\nRead further information:\n- Breast Cancer Now: Breast cancer causes\n- Cancer Research UK: Diet and cancer\n"

        "description": "Breast cancer is often thought of as a condition that only affects women, but men can also develop it.\nIt&#8217;s&nbsp;much less common in men than women.\nThe cancer develops in the small amount of breast tissue men have behind their nipples. The most common symptom is a hard, painless lump in one of the breasts.\nHowever, the vast majority of breast lumps are caused by&nbsp;a condition called gynaecomastia. This is a common non-cancerous condition where male breast tissue becomes enlarged.\nBreast cancer in men can also cause nipple problems, such as the nipple turning in on itself (retraction) or nipple discharge.\nRead more about the symptoms of male breast cancer\nYou should always talk to your GP if you notice a lump in your breast or you have problems affecting your nipples, such as discharge.\nWhile these symptoms are unlikely to be caused by breast cancer, they should be investigated further.&nbsp;\nThe cause of male breast cancer is unclear, but factors known to increase your chances of developing the condition include:\n- age – most cases affect men over the age of&nbsp;60\n- having a family history of breast cancer (male or female)\n- obesity&nbsp;– a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more\nRead more about&nbsp;causes of breast cancer in men\nIn most cases, surgery is used to remove the cancer, along with a section of the breast. This may be followed by a long-term course of hormone-blocking therapy using medication, usually&nbsp;a drug&nbsp;called tamoxifen.\nTamoxifen helps block the effects of hormones&nbsp;known to stimulate the growth of cancerous cells in breast tissue. It should help prevent the cancer returning.\nIn some cases, radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be used for the same purpose.\nRead more about treating breast cancer in men\nThe outlook for breast cancer is not as good in men as in women. This is because there&#8217;s reduced awareness of the condition and it may take longer to diagnose.\nThe survival rates for breast cancer in men largely depend on how far the cancer has spread before it&#8217;s diagnosed.\nBreast cancer diagnosed at an early stage can often be treated successfully, but effective treatment is more difficult if the cancer has spread beyond the breast tissue.\nUnfortunately, many cases are diagnosed after the cancer has already started to spread.\nRead more about&nbsp;diagnosing breast cancer&nbsp;in men.\nThe most effective way of reducing your risk of developing breast cancer, as well as other serious health conditions, is to:\n- drink alcohol in moderation&nbsp;\n- maintain a healthy weight – through a combination of eating a&nbsp;healthy diet and exercising regularly\nRead more about preventing cancer\nThe main symptom of breast cancer in men is a hard lump in one of your breasts. The lump is almost always painless.\nThe lump is usually located underneath the nipple and areola (the circle of dark-coloured skin surrounding the nipple).\nHowever, the vast majority of breast lumps are caused by a condition called gynaecomastia. This is a common non-cancerous condition where male breast tissue becomes enlarged.\nLess common symptoms of male breast cancer&nbsp;include:\n- the nipple beginning to turn in on itself (nipple retraction)\n- the nipple becoming hard and inflamed, and looking sore (nipple ulceration)\n- fluid leaking from the nipple (nipple discharge)\nAdditional symptoms usually only develop if the cancer spreads from the breast to other parts of the body, such as the bones, liver or lungs. This is known as metastatic breast cancer.\nSymptoms of metastatic breast cancer include:\n- bone pain\n- swelling of the lymph nodes (glands), usually in or around the armpit\n- shortness of breath\n- feeling unusually tired all the time\n- feeling sick (nausea)\n- itchy skin&nbsp;with&nbsp;yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)\nYou should always visit your GP if you notice a lump in your breast or you have&nbsp;problems affecting your nipples, such as retraction, ulceration or discharge.&nbsp;\nThese problems&nbsp;are unlikely to be of the result of breast cancer, but they&nbsp;should be&nbsp;investigated further.\nIt&#8217;s not clear exactly what causes breast cancer in men, although a number of things can increase your risk of developing the condition.\nLike many cancers, men have an increased risk of developing breast cancer as they get older. Most cases are diagnosed in men aged 60 to 70. It&#8217;s rare for young men to&nbsp;develop the condition.\nA genetic mutation is&nbsp;a permanent alteration in the DNA sequence that makes up a gene.&nbsp;The result is that&nbsp;one or more of the body&#8217;s processes may not work in the way they should.\nThere are a number of genetic mutations known to increase your risk of developing breast cancer. The most significant mutation identified is known as the BRCA2 mutation.&nbsp;\nThere&#8217;s also evidence that breast cancer can run in families, especially in men who have a first-degree relative who has developed breast cancer,&nbsp;such as a mother or sister.\nRoutine testing for the faulty genes that cause breast cancer in men isn&#8217;t usually carried out on the NHS, unless specifically requested by a specialist. However,&nbsp;some private clinics may offer gene testing. Tests can be expensive, with prices ranging from around £2,000 to £3,000.\nThere&#8217;s evidence that high levels of the hormone oestrogen, or prolonged exposure to it, can increase the risk of breast cancer in men.\nCompared&nbsp;with women, men tend to have low levels of oestrogen, but there are circumstances that can increase the levels of oestrogen in men. These include:\n- hormone treatments – man-made (synthetic) versions of oestrogen are often used to treat prostate cancer, and are also given to transgender patients&nbsp;undergoing a male to female sex change\n- obesity – obese men have higher levels of oestrogen than normal\n- cirrhosis – this is scarring of the liver, often caused by long-term alcohol misuse\nThere is also a rare genetic condition affecting males called Klinefelter syndrome. This is a congenital condition that boys are born with that means those who are affected produce less of the hormone testosterone than usual.\nAs testosterone usually helps to limit the effect of oestrogen, men with Klinefelter syndrome are more likely to develop breast cancer than the general male population.\nThere&#8217;s some evidence men who work in hot environments are twice as likely to develop breast cancer compared with men who work in cooler environments.\nEnvironments linked to an increased risk of breast cancer in men include:\n- blast furnaces\n- steelworks\n- rolling mills – a factory where metal (usually steel) is shaped using rollers\n- car manufacturing plants\nOne hypothesis to help explain the link between working environment and the increased risk of developing breast cancer is that excessive heat may damage the testicles, which could lead to an increase in oestrogen levels.\nAnother hypothesis is that working in hot environments usually involves exposure to certain chemicals that may increase the risk of developing breast cancer in men.\nRates of breast cancer are also unusually high in men who manufacture perfumes and soaps. They are 7 times more likely to develop breast cancer than the male population at large.\nThe reason for this increased risk is still unclear. Exposure to certain chemicals seems to be an obvious possibility, but this hasn&#8217;t yet been proven.\nExposure to radiation has been linked to an increased risk of developing breast cancer in men.\nResearch has found men who received a course of radiotherapy&nbsp;– where high energy X-rays are used to kill cancerous cells&nbsp;–&nbsp;directed at the upper chest were seven times more likely to develop male breast cancer compared&nbsp;with the population at large.\nHowever, even a seven-fold increase means the chance of developing breast cancer is still very low.\nIf you have symptoms of breast cancer, such as a hard, painless lump in one of your breasts, your GP will carefully examine you.\nDuring the examination, they&#8217;ll also look for other possible signs of male breast cancer, such as swollen lymph nodes (glands).\nIt&#8217;s likely your GP will refer you for further tests if there&#8217;s a possibility you may have breast cancer.&nbsp;\nA mammogram is a type of X-ray used to help determine whether there are any changes in breast tissue that could be the result of cancer.\nDuring the mammogram procedure, a radiographer (a specialist in taking X-rays) will compress one of your breasts between two X-ray plates. This shouldn&#8217;t be painful, but you should tell the radiographer if you find it uncomfortable.\nOnce your breast has been correctly positioned, an X-ray will be taken that produces a clear image of the inside of your breast. The procedure will then be carried out on your other breast.\nAn ultrasound scan uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your breasts, in the same way an unborn baby can be seen in the womb.\nAn ultrasound probe or sensor will be placed over your breasts to create an image of the inside of your breasts on a screen. The image will highlight any lumps or abnormalities that may be present in your breasts.\nA biopsy may be recommended if a mammogram or ultrasound scan highlight any lumps or abnormalities in your breasts.\nA biopsy is a test that can either confirm or rule out a diagnosis of breast cancer in men. It involves taking a sample of suspected cancerous tissue and examining it in a laboratory for the presence of cancerous cells.\nA type of biopsy known as a core biopsy is usually recommended for the diagnosis of breast cancer in men. This type of biopsy can usually indicate whether the cancer has started to spread from the breast into the surrounding area.\nDuring a core biopsy, a local anaesthetic will be used to numb your breast. A hollow needle will then be used to remove a number of small tissue samples from the breast lump.\nIf cancer is found, it&#8217;s also possible to check whether there are special proteins, known as oestrogen receptors, on the surface of the cancerous cells.\nThis is important, because if oestrogen receptors are found&nbsp;– and they are in more than half&nbsp;of cases&nbsp;–&nbsp;it&#8217;s possible to treat the cancer with hormone therapy.\nRead&nbsp;treating breast cancer in men for more information.\nAfter breast cancer has been diagnosed, your care team should provide information about the stage of the cancer. Staging is a system used to describe how far a cancer has spread at the point of diagnosis.\nA cure may be possible if breast cancer is diagnosed at an early stage. However, treatment can only be used to control symptoms and slow the spread of the cancer if it&#8217;s diagnosed at a later stage. Unfortunately, more than 40% of breast cancers in men are diagnosed at a late stage.\nIn some cases, men are diagnosed with a type of breast cancer called ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). This means there are cancer cells in the breast, but they&#8217;re contained within the breast ducts and can&#8217;t spread.\nIf left untreated, DCIS can lead to invasive breast cancer over a period of time.\nBeing told you have breast cancer can cause a wide range of emotions, such as shock, fear, confusion and, in some cases, embarrassment.\nMost people assume breast cancer only affects women, so it can be difficult to come to terms with the diagnosis.\nFeelings of isolation and being alone are common in men with breast cancer. This may be because there&#8217;s little in the way of advice and support for men with breast cancer, particularly when compared&nbsp;with the support available for women with the condition.\nSometimes men who find themselves in this situation can become depressed. You may be depressed if you&#8217;ve felt very down and no longer interested in doing activities you used to enjoy&nbsp;during the past month.\nIf you think you may be depressed, visit your GP. There is a range of effective treatments, such as medication and counselling, that can help relieve feelings of depression.\nYou may also find it useful to talk to other men affected by the condition. Breast Cancer Now is a breast cancer charity that provides an online forum for anyone diagnosed with breast cancer. Cancer Research UK also provides Cancer Chat, an online forum for anyone affected by cancer.\nAs breast cancer is&nbsp;rare in&nbsp;men, routine screening for the condition isn&#8217;t recommended, even for men in high-risk groups, such as those with a family history of breast cancer or those who have had radiotherapy.\nTreatment for breast cancer in men largely depends on how far the cancer has spread.\nMost hospitals use multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) to treat men with breast cancer. These are teams of specialists&nbsp;who work together to make decisions about the best way to proceed with your treatment.\nDeciding which treatment is best for you can often be confusing. Your cancer team will recommend what they think is the ideal treatment option, but the final decision will be yours.\nBefore visiting hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions you&#8217;d like to ask the specialist. For example, you could ask about&nbsp;the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.\nYour recommended treatment plan depends on how far the cancer has spread. If the cancer hasn&#8217;t spread significantly beyond your breast, a complete cure may be possible.\nIn these cases, surgery to remove the affected breast is usually recommended. This is often followed by radiotherapy, hormone therapy, or chemotherapy to help prevent the cancer returning.\nIf the cancer has spread beyond your breast into other parts of your body, such as your lungs, a complete cure won&#8217;t be possible. However, hormone therapy and chemotherapy can be used to relieve symptoms and slow down the spread of the cancer.\nMore information about these treatments can be found below.\nAn operation called a mastectomy is usually recommended as the first treatment for breast cancer.\nA mastectomy involves removing the entire breast,&nbsp;sometimes with the nipple and lymph nodes (glands) in the armpit. A procedure known as a&nbsp;sentinel lymph node biopsy may also be performed.\nIn some cases, part of the muscle under the breast may also be removed if there&#8217;s a risk the cancer has spread to this area.\nOnce surgery has been completed, there will be a straight scar across your chest where your nipple used to be and possibly an indentation around the area where the breast tissue used to be.\nMost men are well enough to leave hospital 1 to 3 days after surgery.\nAfter the operation, it&#8217;s likely you&#8217;ll feel very tired and it may take a few weeks before you&#8217;re well enough to start carrying out relatively strenuous activities, such as lifting objects or driving. Your specialist nurse will be able to offer more specific advice about this.\nThe wound takes about 2 to 3 weeks to heal. It&#8217;s important to keep the wound clean during this time.\nYou should look for any signs that the wound may have become infected, such as redness and swelling around the wound or a discharge of pus. Inform your MDT as soon as possible if you suspect an infection.\nIt&#8217;s difficult to predict when you&#8217;ll feel able to return to work. Some people choose to remain off work until other treatments, such as radiotherapy, have been completed.\nOthers prefer to return to work in between treatments. Your MDT will be able to advise you, but the final decision will be yours.\nIt can take several weeks to fully recover from the effects of a mastectomy. A structured exercise programme, where the intensity and amount of time spent exercising is gradually increased, will probably be recommended.\nYour&nbsp;treatment team&nbsp;will be able to provide you with more advice or refer you to a physiotherapist (a specialist with training in rehabilitation using exercise).\nAfter&nbsp;surgery, you may experience numbness or tingling at the site of the scar and in your upper arm. This is common, and is&nbsp;caused by nerve damage during surgery.\nThe numbness and tingling should pass within a few weeks or months, although it can occasionally be permanent.\nAnother&nbsp;possible complication is painful swelling in the arms. This is called lymphoedema, which is caused by the disruption of the lymphatic system (a series of channels and lymph nodes normally responsible for removing excess fluid from tissue).\nIf many lymph nodes are surgically removed, it can disrupt the lymphatic system&#8217;s ability to drain fluid, which can lead to swelling.\nThere&#8217;s no cure for lymphoedema, but it&#8217;s possible to control the symptoms using a combination of different techniques, such as massage and compression garments.\nSee treating lymphoedema&nbsp;for more information\nRadiotherapy is a type of treatment involving a machine that releases high-energy waves to destroy cancerous cells. It can be given a few weeks after surgery to prevent the cancerous cells returning.\nA typical course of radiotherapy involves 2 to 5 sessions a week over the course of 3 to 6 weeks. The sessions are short and usually only last for 10 to 15 minutes.\nRadiotherapy isn&#8217;t usually painful, although you&#8217;ll probably experience some side effects. This is because the energy released during radiotherapy can also damage healthy cells.\nCommon side effects of radiotherapy can include:\n- extreme tiredness (fatigue)\n- feeling sick (nausea)\n- sore, red and irritated skin on the breast similar in appearance to sunburn\nThe side effects of radiotherapy should pass after your course of treatment has finished, although some men experience prolonged fatigue for several months.\nRadiotherapy can also be used in cases of advanced breast cancer to slow down the spread of the cancer and relieve the symptoms of pain. This is known as palliative radiotherapy.\nPalliative radiotherapy is usually given in just 1 or 2 doses and doesn&#8217;t usually cause any side effects.\nUp to&nbsp;90% of cases of breast cancers in men are oestrogen receptor positive, or ER+. &#8216;E&#8217; is used because the American spelling of oestrogen is &#8216;estrogen&#8217;.\nThis means the cancerous cells require oestrogen to grow. Oestrogen is a type of hormone found in low levels in men and much higher levels in women.\nThe aim of hormone therapy is to block the effects of oestrogen on the breast tissue to prevent the cancer recurring after surgery. It can also be used in cases of advanced breast cancer to slow down the spread of the cancer.\nTamoxifen is&nbsp;one of the hormone-blocking&nbsp;medications widely used for breast cancer. It&#8217;s available in tablet or liquid form, and prevents oestrogen entering the breast tissue cells.\nThe ideal length of treatment with tamoxifen is unclear. Studies in women with breast cancer suggest a five-year course of treatment is the most effective for preventing the return of cancer and extending survival rates. However, it&#8217;s unclear if this also applies to men.\nTamoxifen can also cause unpleasant side effects, which will be taken into consideration when your&nbsp;treatment team&nbsp;is deciding which treatments to recommend. You can discuss the pros and cons of long-term treatment with tamoxifen with your doctors.\nSide effects of tamoxifen can&nbsp;include:\n- reduced interest in sex (loss of&nbsp;libido)\n- inability to obtain or maintain an erection (erectile dysfunction)\n- headache\n- feeling sick&nbsp;–&nbsp;taking your medication with food may help reduce this side effect\n- changes in mood, such as feeling irritable or depressed\nYou should inform your&nbsp;team if you experience side effects that become particularly troublesome, as alternative medications are available.\nAromatase inhibitors are an alternative&nbsp;type of hormone medication. They may be used if tamoxifen proves unsuccessful or the side effects of tamoxifen are particularly troublesome. Aromatase inhibitors can also be used to slow the spread of advanced breast cancer.\nIn men, oestrogen is created when a protein called aromatase converts another hormone called androgens. Aromatase inhibitors block the effects of aromatase, which in turn lowers the amount of oestrogen in the body.\nAromatase inhibitors are usually given in tablet form and taken daily for two to five years. As with tamoxifen, there&#8217;s little available evidence about the most effective length of dosage in men, compared with female breast cancer.\nSide effects of aromatase inhibitors can include:\n- joint pain\n- lack of energy\n- hot flushes\n- skin rashes\n- feeling sick\n- being sick\n- thinning of the hair\nHowever, it&#8217;s unlikely you&#8217;ll experience any or all of these side effects.\nChemotherapy is used to treat cases of breast cancer where hormone therapy would be largely ineffective because the cancerous cells are not oestrogen receptor positive (ER+).\nIt&#8217;s usually given after surgery to help prevent the cancer returning, or it&#8217;s used to treat the symptoms of incurable cancer.\nChemotherapy for breast cancer involves taking a combination of cancer-killing medications. Treatment is usually given every 2 to&nbsp;3&nbsp; weeks over the course of 6 months.\nYou may be given chemotherapy tablets (oral chemotherapy), chemotherapy injections (intravenous chemotherapy), or a combination of both.\nThe side effects of chemotherapy can include:\n- feeling sick\n- being sick\n- diarrhoea \n- loss of appetite\n- mouth ulcers\n- tiredness\n- skin rashes\n- infertility\n- hair loss\nThe side effects should resolve once your treatment has finished.&nbsp;Your hair should grow back about 3 to 6 months&nbsp;after treatment.\nChemotherapy can also weaken your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection. It&#8217;s important to&nbsp;tell your MDT about&nbsp;any symptoms of a potential infection, such as:\n- a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above\n- flu-like symptoms, such as chills or joint pain\n- a general sense of feeling unwell\nYou should also avoid close contact with people known to have an infection.\nIf you&#8217;re sexually active, you should use a condom for 48 hours after receiving a dose of chemotherapy medication. This is because the medication used in chemotherapy could pass into your semen and cause irritation in the tissue of your partner&#8217;s genitals.\nYou should avoid having children while receiving chemotherapy as many of the medications can damage your sperm and increase your chances of having a baby with a birth defect. Again, using a reliable method of contraception, such as a condom, is recommended\nDepending on the medications used, it may be several months after your course of chemotherapy has ended before you can safely have children. Your MDT will be able to give you a more detailed recommendation.\nBiological therapy uses medication to block the effects of a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in cases where HER2 is contributing to breast cancer.\nBiological therapies are sometimes referred to as targeted therapies because they are designed to target biological processes that cancers rely on to grow and reproduce.\nIf you have high levels of the HER2 protein and&nbsp;are able to have biological therapy, you&#8217;ll probably be prescribed a medicine called trastuzumab.&nbsp;Also known by the brand name Herceptin, it&nbsp;is usually used after radiotherapy or chemotherapy to prevent cancerous cells returning.\nTrastuzumab is a type of biological therapy known as a monoclonal antibody. Antibodies occur naturally in the body and are created by the immune system to destroy harmful cells, such as viruses and bacteria. The trastuzumab antibody targets and destroys cancer cells designed to respond to the HER2 protein.\nTrastuzumab is given through a drip, directly into a vein (intravenously). You&#8217;ll receive the treatment in hospital. Each treatment session takes up to 1 hour, and the number of sessions you need depends on whether your breast cancer is in its early or more advanced stages.\nOn average, for early breast cancer you&#8217;ll need to have a session once every 3 weeks, and for more advanced cancer you&#8217;ll need to have weekly sessions.\nTrastuzumab can cause side effects, including heart problems. This means it&#8217;s not suitable if you have a heart problem, such as angina, uncontrolled high blood pressure (hypertension), or heart valve disease.\nIf you need to take trastuzumab, you&#8217;ll need to have regular tests on your heart to ensure it&#8217;s not causing any problems.\nOther side effects of trastuzumab&nbsp;can include:\n- an initial allergic reaction to the medication, which can cause nausea, wheezing, chills and fever\n- diarrhoea\n- tiredness\n- aches and pains"

        "disease": "Bronchiectasis",
        "description": "Bronchiectasis is a long-term condition where the airways of the lungs become abnormally widened. It leads to a build-up of mucus (phlegm) that can increase risk of infection.\nIt can affect anyone at any age, but symptoms don&#8217;t usually develop until middle age.\nThe most common symptoms of bronchiectasis include:\n- a persistent cough that usually brings up mucus\n- recurrent chest infections\n- fatigue\nSymptoms can vary from person to person. They tend to get worse if you have an infection in your lungs.\nYou have bronchiectasis and either:\nYour GP may:\n- ask you about your symptoms\n- ask whether you smoke\n- listen to your lungs with a stethoscope (the lungs of people with bronchiectasis often make a distinctive crackling noise)\n- send you for an X-ray to rule out other conditions\nIf your GP thinks you may have a lung infection, they may take a sample of mucus so it can be checked for bacteria.\nIf your GP thinks you may have bronchiectasis, they&#8217;ll refer you to a specialist in treating lung conditions for further tests such as:\n- a CT scan – to see if your airways have widened or to see any signs of chronic infection\n- blood tests – to check how well your immune system is working\n- mucus (sputum) test – to check for bacteria or fungi\n- throat swab – to look for viruses\n- genetic screening test – where a sample of blood or saliva is checked for the faulty gene that causes cystic fibrosis\n- lung function test – to measure how hard and how quickly you can blow out air from your lungs to check how well they&#8217;re working\n- bronchoscopy – a flexible tube with a camera to look into your lungs to look for anything abnormal and to take samples from the airways if a chronic infection is suspected\nThe damage caused to the lungs by bronchiectasis is permanent. But treatment can help your symptoms and stop the damage getting worse.\nThe main treatments include:\n- exercises and special devices to help you clear mucus out of your lungs\n- medication to help improve airflow within the lungs\n- antibiotics to treat any lung infections\nYou should:\n- stop smoking (if you smoke)\n- have the flu vaccine every year\n- make sure you have had the pneumococcal vaccine to protect against pneumonia\n- make sure you have had the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine\n- exercise regularly\n- keep yourself well hydrated\n- aim for a healthy weight\nSurgery for bronchiectasis is only in rare cases. It&#8217;s only used if other treatments haven&#8217;t worked, the damage to the lung is localised to one lobe, and you&#8217;re otherwise healthy.\nThere are a range of exercises which can help to remove mucus from your lungs. These are known as airway clearance techniques. They can often help coughing and breathlessness.\nYou can be referred to a physiotherapist who can teach you these techniques.\nActive cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT) involves you repeating a cycle made up of different steps. For example, a period of normal breathing, followed by deep breaths to loosen the mucus and force it up. Then you cough the mucus out. The cycle is then repeated for 20 to 30 minutes.\nDo not attempt ACBT if you haven&#8217;t first been taught the steps by a physiotherapist. Doing it incorrectly could damage your lungs.\nIf you&#8217;re otherwise healthy, you&#8217;ll probably only need to do ACBT once or twice a day. If you develop a lung infection, you may need to do it more.\nChanging your position can also make it easier to remove mucus from your lungs. This is known as postural drainage. The steps are usually done with the help of a physiotherapist or carer.\nThere are also handheld devices that can help to remove mucus from your lungs. Generally, they use a combination of vibrations and air pressure to make it easier to cough out any mucus.\nExamples of these devices include the Flutter, the RC cornet, the Acapella and the Aerobika.\nThese devices aren&#8217;t always available on the NHS. You may have to pay for one yourself.\nIn some cases, medications to make breathing or clearing your lungs easier may be prescribed.\nIf you have very severe symptoms, you may be prescribed bronchodilator medications.\nBronchodilators are medications you breathe in. They help make breathing easier by relaxing the muscles in the lungs. Examples of this type of medication include:\n- beta-2 agonist such as salbutamol, terbutaline, formoterol or salmeterol\n- antimuscarinics such as tiotropium, glycopyrronium or aclidinium\nIf your symptoms are getting worse because of infection, you&#8217;ll need to be treated with antibiotics.\nIf you&#8217;re well enough to be treated at home, you&#8217;ll probably be prescribed 2 to 3 antibiotic tablets a day for 14 days. It&#8217;s important to finish the course even if you feel better.\nRecovering fully from a bronchiectasis exacerbation can take months.\nIf your symptoms are more severe, you may need to go to hospital for antibiotic injections.\nIf you have 3 or more infections in a year, or your symptoms during infection are very severe, you may be given antibiotics on a long-term basis.\nOccasionally, medication breathed in through a device called a nebuliser may be recommended. This makes it easier to clear your lungs.\nNebulisers have:\n- a face mask or mouthpiece\n- a chamber to change medication into a fine mist\n- a compressor to pump the medication into your lungs\nDifferent medications can be given using a nebuliser. For example, salt water solutions, which should only be used if prescribed by your healthcare professional. These medications help to reduce the thickness of your mucus so it&#8217;s easier to cough out.\nThe medications used with a nebuliser can be provided on prescription. But the nebuliser device itself isn&#8217;t always available on the NHS. You may have to pay for a device, but only if it is advised for use by your healthcare professional.\nThe cause of bronchiectasis is not fully understood. Widened airways and increased risk of infection can be linked to:\n- previous infections, such as pneumonia or whooping cough\n- problems with the immune system (the body’s defence against infection)\n- having long-term lung conditions (COPD)\n- allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) – if you breathe in spores from a fungi that you&#8217;re allergic to\nIn most cases of bronchiectasis, no clear cause can be found. This is known as idiopathic bronchiectasis."

        "description": "Bronchitis is an infection of the main airways of the lungs (bronchi). It causes them to become irritated and inflamed.\nMost cases of bronchitis can be treated at home.\nBronchitis can affect people of all ages. It&#8217;s most common in children under the age of 5. It&#8217;s more common in winter, and often develops after a cold, sore throat or flu.\nThe main symptom is a hacking cough, which may bring up yellow-green mucus (phlegm). Bronchitis may also cause:\n- sore throat\n- headache\n- runny or blocked nose\n- aches and pains\n- tiredness\n- shortness of breath or wheezing\nIf your GP practice is closed, phone 111.\nIn most cases, bronchitis will clear up by itself within a few weeks without needing treatment. This type of bronchitis is known as acute bronchitis.\nYour cough may last for several weeks after other symptoms have gone. You may also find that the continual coughing makes your chest and stomach muscles sore.\nPneumonia is the most common complication of bronchitis. It happens when the infection spreads further into the lungs, causing air sacs inside the lungs to fill up with fluid.\nPeople at an increased risk of developing pneumonia include:\n- elderly people\n- people who smoke\n- people with other health conditions, such as heart, liver or kidney disease\n- people with a weakened immune system\nMild pneumonia can usually be treated with antibiotics at home. More severe cases may need treatment in hospital."

        "disease": "Bulimia nervosa",
        "description": "Bulimia nervosa is a serious eating disorder and mental health condition. People with bulimia can find themselves trapped in a cycle of eating a large amount of food (also called bingeing). They then use methods like vomiting, over exercising or using laxatives to get rid of the food.\nThere are some common symptoms of bulimia nervosa. You may experience some or all of these. This includes:\n- bingeing – eating an unusually large amount of food in a short time, this could be as much as or more than what a person might eat in a day\n- purging – trying to reduce the effect of bingeing by attempting to get food out of your body\n- fasting &#8211; trying to restrict food intake\n- focus on food – thinking about food all the time, being secretive about food intake or hoarding food\n- organising your life around a shopping, eating and purging cycle\n- having a fear of eating in front of others\n- focusing on your body shape and weight\n- focusing on exercising to burn calories beyond a healthy level\n- wearing baggy clothes to hide your body\n- withdrawing from friends and family\n- difficulty sleeping or sleeping more than usual\n- feeling irritable, low mood or anxiety\n- feeling guilt, shame or despair\n- always checking the ingredients or nutritional labels of food\n- difficulty concentrating\nFor some people bingeing and purging might be a way of trying to cope with overwhelming feelings.\nYou think you have an eating disorder like bulimia nervosa or are experiencing symptoms like:\nWhen making a diagnosis, your GP will probably ask questions about your eating habits.\nThey could ask:\n- how you feel about your body shape or weight\n- if you make yourself sick after eating\n- if you use other methods of purging or use laxatives\n- if you binge-eat\nIt’s important to answer these questions honestly. Your GP isn’t trying to judge you or catch you out. They just need to accurately assess your symptoms.\nYour GP may also check your weight and other physical measurements. If this feels frightening, you can request that you are not told your weight\nBEAT have more information on planning an appointment, how to talk to your GP and what will happen at an appointment.\nIf you feel like it would help you, you can take a friend or family member to your appointment.\nIt can be difficult to know what the right questions to ask at an appointment are, it&#8217;s ok to ask has some ideas that may be helpful.\nYour GP might check your pulse and blood pressure.\nSometimes an electrocardiogram (ECG) may be needed to check how well your heart is working.\nYour GP may do blood tests to check the level of:\n- fluids in your body\n- chemicals or minerals, like potassium, in your blood\nBlood tests look for the complications of bulimia nervosa. Even if they come back as ‘normal’, your GP may still refer you to an eating disorder specialist if you’re experiencing bulimia nervosa symptoms.\nThey may also suggest you make a dental appointment as frequent vomiting can harm your dental health.\nBefore your treatment begins, it&#8217;s likely you&#8217;ll have an overall assessment of your health. Your GP or another healthcare professional will do this.\nThe assessment will help your healthcare professional plan for your treatment and care.\nThey may assess:\n- your overall health and any medical needs\n- your social situation, like how much support you have from family and friends\n- your mental wellbeing or other mental health concerns\n- any other risks that might affect you\n- whether there are any physical health risks that need urgent treatment\nFor many people, guided self-help, based on a cognitive behavioural approach, can be an effective treatment for bulimia nervosa.\nGuided self-help is where you work through information and activities on your own. You’ll have regular support sessions.\nActivities can include things like worksheets and writing about difficult thoughts and feelings.\nYour GP may refer you for treatment to an eating disorder service. An eating disorder service will usually offer a structured programme of treatment which may include physical monitoring, dietetic advice and psychological treatment.\nFreed has more information about seeking help for an eating disorder.\nThe main type of psychological treatment for bulimia nervosa is cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).\nCBT starts with the idea that thoughts, feelings, and behaviour are linked and affect one another. CBT aims to improve your eating behaviours. It tries to help you see how the ways you think, affect how you feel, and what you do.\nOne alternative to CBT is interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT). IPT explores the way your relationships with people close to you impact the way you feel and how to improve these relationships.\nOther psychological therapies include:\n- integrative cognitive affective therapy\n- schema therapy\nThe psychological therapies matrix for Bulimia Nervosa explains what therapies are most likely to help you based on your needs and the current evidence.\nLearn more about talking therapies\nFamily Based Treatment (FBT) involves the whole family in solving their child or young person&#8217;s eating disorder. During FBT parents and carers are an essential part of the solution and members of the treatment team.\nCBT may also be used. It can be tailored for young people experiencing bulimia nervosa.\nIf these treatments are not suitable then psychodynamic psychotherapy might be offered. This helps you understand how your current feelings and behaviour are shaped by your past experiences.\nAntidepressants like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be used to treat bulimia. They can reduce the urges to binge and purge and improve how you feel.\nThe medication will usually take several weeks before it starts to work. You’ll usually start on a low dose. The dose will gradually increase as your body adjusts to the medicine.\nVery few types of medication are recommended for children and young people below the age of 16.\nRecovery from bulimia nervosa can take a long time but treatments are effective for many people.\nSymptoms may return after treatment. This is often called a relapse, and is more likely during times of stress.\nIf relapse happens, the approach to getting treatment is the same. The first step is to go to your GP. Using the strategies you found useful before are likely to be helpful.\nThere are physical complications associated with bulimia nervosa.\nThese can include:\n- dental problems – regular vomiting can cause your stomach acid to damage the enamel on your teeth, which can lead to tooth decay\n- repeated vomiting can cause bad breath and a sore throat\n- your skin and hair can become dry and your fingernails can become brittle due to a lack of nutrients\n- your saliva glands can become swollen from frequent vomiting, which makes your face appear rounder than before\n- frequent use of laxatives can damage your bowel muscles, causing permanent constipation (finding it difficult to poo)\n- an increased risk of heart problems\nFrequent vomiting or laxative use can cause:\n- tiredness\n- weakness\n- abnormal heart rhythms\n- kidney damage\n- convulsions (fits)\n- muscle spasms\nSome of these symptoms are cause by an imbalance in your electrolytes, in particular, low potassium levels.\nIf you have periods, bulimia nervosa can cause them to become unpredictable, or stop altogether. This does not mean bulimia nervosa makes you infertile. While it may be harder to get pregnant while living with bulimia nervosa, you should continue to use birth control if you aren’t planning a pregnancy.\nIf you have diabetes, you’ll need regular health checks to help avoid problems with your eyes or other serious complications. This is particularly important if you have type 1 diabetes.\nIt&#8217;s common for people with bulimia nervosa to experience other mental health problems like depression.\nPeople with bulimia nervosa can be anxious about seeking treatment but its important to get help as soon as possible.\nIf you have eating problems or think you may have bulimia nervosa, it’s important to seek help as soon as possible.\nYou could start by:\n- talking to someone you trust, like a friend, member of your family or teacher\n- going to see your GP &#8211; you may find it helpful to bring someone with you for support\nBeat has more information about how to prepare for speaking to your GP and what to expect during your appointment.\nIf someone close to you is showing signs of bulimia nervosa, you can offer help and support.\nYou could try talking to them about how they feel, and encourage them to think about getting help. Try not to put pressure on them or be critical of them, as this could make things worse. You could also offer to help by going with the person to see their GP.\nYou could speak to your own GP or a healthcare professional if you’d like some advice on how to help someone.\nYou could also get help from an online or in person support group for people who have loved ones with eating disorders. Your GP or healthcare professional can help you find services suitable for you.

        "disease": "Carcinoid syndrome and carcinoid tumours",
        "description": "A carcinoid tumour is a rare cancer of the neuroendocrine system – the body system that produces hormones.\nThe tumour&nbsp;usually grows&nbsp;in the bowels or appendix, but it can also be found in the stomach, pancreas, lung, breast, kidney, ovaries or testicles. It tends to grow very slowly.\nCarcinoid syndrome is the collection of symptoms some people get when a carcinoid tumour – usually one that has spread to the liver – releases hormones such as serotonin into the bloodstream.\nIn the early stages of having a carcinoid tumour, you may not have any symptoms. You may also not have symptoms if the tumour is just in your digestive system, as any hormones it produces will be broken down by your liver.\nIf symptoms&nbsp;do develop, they tend to be fairly general and can be easily mistaken for signs of other illnesses.\nSymptoms may result from both the tumour itself and from any hormones it releases into the bloodstream.\nSymptoms will depend&nbsp;on where in the body the tumour develops:\n- a&nbsp;bowel carcinoid tumour may cause&nbsp;tummy pain, a blocked bowel (diarrhoea,&nbsp;constipation, feeling or being sick) and&nbsp;bleeding from the bottom (rectal bleeding)\n- a&nbsp;lung carcinoid tumour may cause a&nbsp;cough, which may make you cough up blood, and cause wheezing,&nbsp;breathlessness,&nbsp;chest pain&nbsp;and tiredness\n- a&nbsp;stomach carcinoid tumour may cause pain, weight loss, tiredness and weakness\nSome tumours may not cause any symptoms and are discovered by chance. For example,&nbsp;an appendix carcinoid tumour may only be&nbsp;found when the appendix is being removed for another reason.\nTypical symptoms of carcinoid syndrome include:\n- diarrhoea,&nbsp;tummy pain and loss of appetite\n- flushing&nbsp;of the skin, particularly the face\n- fast heart rate\n- breathlessness and wheezing\nThese symptoms may come on unexpectedly, as the hormones can be produced by the tumour at any time.\nSome people may also develop&nbsp;carcinoid heart disease, where&nbsp;the heart valves thicken and&nbsp;stop working properly. There is also a risk of developing a rare but serious reaction called&nbsp;a carcinoid crisis, which involves severe flushing, breathlessness and a drop in blood pressure.\nIt’s&nbsp;not&nbsp;known exactly&nbsp;why carcinoid tumours develop, but it’s thought that most&nbsp;occur by chance.\nYour chances of developing a carcinoid tumour may be increased if you have:\n- a rare family syndrome called multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1)\n- parents or siblings with a carcinoid tumour\n- parents with&nbsp;squamous cell skin cancer,&nbsp;non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, or cancer of the brain, breast, liver, womb, bladder or kidney\n- conditions called neurofibromatosis or tuberous sclerosis\nA&nbsp;carcinoid tumour may be found incidentally – for example, as a surgeon is removing an appendix. In this case, the tumour will often be caught early and removed along with the appendix, causing no further problems.\nOtherwise, people usually speak to their GP after they have developed symptoms. A carcinoid tumour may be diagnosed after carrying out a series of scans and tests, which may include measuring the amount of serotonin in your urine and having an endoscopy.\nIf the tumour is caught early, it may be possible to completely remove it and cure the cancer altogether. Otherwise, surgeons will remove as much of the tumour as possible (debulking).\nIf the tumour cannot be removed, but it’s not growing or causing symptoms, you may not need treatment straight away – it might just be carefully monitored.&nbsp;\nIf it’s causing symptoms, you may be offered one of the&nbsp;following treatments:\n- injections of medicines called somatostatin analogues, such as octreotide and lanreotide, which can slow down the growth of the tumour\n- radiotherapy&nbsp;to kill some of the cancer cells\n- a procedure to block the blood supply to&nbsp;the&nbsp;tumour (for tumours in the liver), known as&nbsp;hepatic artery embolisation\n- a procedure that uses a heated probe to kill cancer cells (for tumours in the liver), called&nbsp;radiofrequency ablation\n- chemotherapy&nbsp;to shrink the tumour and control your symptoms\nSymptoms of carcinoid syndrome can&nbsp;be treated with injections of octreotide and lanreotide.&nbsp;You may also be given&nbsp;medication to widen your airways (to relieve wheezing and breathlessness) and anti-diarrhoea medication.\nThere are things you can do yourself to manage some of the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome.\nGenerally, you should avoid triggers of flushing, such as:\n- alcohol\n- large meals\n- spicy foods\n- foods containing the substance tyramine, such as aged cheese and salted or pickled meats\n- stress\nSome medications, such as&nbsp;selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants, may make symptoms worse by further increasing your levels of serotonin – but never stop taking medication without seeking medical advice.\nIf you have diarrhoea, it’s important to keep drinking little and often to avoid&nbsp;dehydration.\nIf the whole tumour can be removed, this may cure the cancer and symptoms altogether. But even if surgeons cannot remove the entire tumour, it usually grows slowly and can be controlled with medication.\nOverall,&nbsp;people with carcinoid tumours&nbsp;have a good life expectancy compared to many other cancers. Many people remain relatively well and lead active lives, with only occasional symptoms.\nBut&nbsp;as the tumour&nbsp;grows or spreads, it will produce more and more hormones, and it may eventually be difficult to completely control symptoms with medication. You may need further surgery or other treatments.\nUnfortunately, life expectancy is not as good for cancer that has spread to other parts of your body, because it won’t usually be possible to remove all of it. However, treatment can still control your symptoms and slow down the spread of cancer.\nIf you have carcinoid syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).\nThis helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition.

It may also become a problem when holding an object such as a phone, book or steering wheel, when your wrist is bent forwards and your fingers are in a fist position.\nThis can result in feelings of weakness and clumsiness in the hand with reduced sensation and reduced grip strength.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nThis condition can appear without any apparent reason, however, your risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome can increase if you have:\n- a job that involves repetitive activity involving your hand\n- diabetes &nbsp;(Type 1 and 2)\n- inflammation of the tendons\n- fracture at the wrist &nbsp;\n- rheumatoid arthritis in your wrist joint &nbsp;\n- pregnancy\n- menopause &nbsp;\n- thyroid problems &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\nThe main way carpal tunnel syndrome is diagnosed is by a healthcare professional examining your wrist and hand.&nbsp;As the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome are similar to other conditions, they may assess other areas of the body, particularly the neck.\nNerve conduction studies can also be performed but are not essential to make a diagnosis.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nBlood tests are sometimes taken to see if there is another condition that may be contributing to the problem.&nbsp;\nFor all wrist problems it&#8217;s important to remain active and effectively manage your pain levels.\nTry to vary your activities during the day ensuring that you aren&#8217;t doing lots of repeated squeezing, gripping or wringing.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nTry to alternate between heavier and lighter activities to reduce any strain.&nbsp;Consider other ways of doing a task to reduce this or increase the amount of rest you take between such activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nYou can use padded handles for cycling, gardening or golf.&nbsp;\nBe aware of your wrist position and try and avoid having it bent in either direction for any prolonged period of time.\nA wrist splint is often advised by your healthcare professional as a first treatment option. The aim of the splint is to keep the wrist straight at night. This shouldn&#8217;t stop you from keeping your wrist mobile during the day.\nA splint can be used at night to stop you bending your wrist whilst sleeping as this position can squash the median nerve.\nYou may sometimes need to use a splint during the day when carrying out repetitive activities, it&#8217;s not advised to wear this all the time. You may only need to use this for a few weeks in order to settle the symptoms.\nTargeted wrist exercises to encourage movement, stretching and strengthening can help to improve your wrist and hand movement and pain.&nbsp;\nRead about exercises for wrist, hand and finger problems\nPain medication can help you move more comfortably, which can help your recovery.\nMore about taking painkillers&nbsp;\nIf painkillers aren&#8217;t helping to control the pain, your healthcare professional may discuss the option of having a corticosteroid injection into your carpal tunnel.\nCorticosteroids are medicines that help reduce pain and inflammation. They may also be given with a local anaesthetic.\nInjections may not cure your condition, they are used to help with the pain.\nRead more about corticosteroids\nIn some cases, surgery may be an option if all other treatment options have been tried. The operation is called a carpal tunnel decompression and involves reducing the pressure on the nerve by opening the roof of the tunnel.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nCarpal tunnel syndrome&nbsp;can sometimes mean you need to take some time off work to help recovery. How long you&#8217;re off will depend on the nature of your condition and your role at work.\nYou do not need to be symptom free before you consider returning to work. Continuing to go to work, or returning to work as soon as is possible for you, will help your recovery. Gradually getting back to your normal daily activities can help to build up your strength and stamina levels.\nFollowing this advice, you should see gradual improvements over time.&nbsp;\nIf your symptoms haven&#8217;t improved, or it&#8217;s got worse, within 6 weeks of following this advice, talk to a healthcare professional about your symptoms.&nbsp;\nFind out how to access MSK services in your area.&nbsp;\nWhen dealing with any health condition it&#8217;s important to also look after your mental wellbeing as this can impact your recovery."

        "description": "Catarrh is a build-up of mucus (phlegm) in your airways. It usually affects the back of the nose, the throat or the sinuses.\nIt&#8217;s often temporary, but some people experience it for months or years. This is known as chronic catarrh.\nCatarrh is not harmful and there are treatments available.\nCatarrh can lead to a:\n- constant need to clear your throat\n- feeling that your throat is blocked\n- blocked or stuffy nose that you can&#8217;t clear\n- runny nose\n- feeling of mucus running down the back of your throat\n- persistent cough\n- headache\n- facial pain\n- reduced sense of smell and taste\n- crackling sensation in your ear and some temporary hearing loss\nThese problems can be frustrating to live with. They may affect your sleep, making you feel tired.\nYour GP may check if there&#8217;s a condition causing it like nasal polyps or allergies.\nYou may be referred to a specialist for tests.\nCatarrh will often pass in a few days or weeks.\nYou can ask a pharmacist for:\n- advice about catarrh\n- over-the-counter medications such as decongestants, antihistamines or steroid nasal sprays\nCatarrh is usually caused by the immune system reacting to an infection or irritation. This causes the lining of your nose and throat to become swollen and produce mucus.\nThis can be triggered by:\n- a cold or other infections\n- hay fever or other types of allergic rhinitis\n- non-allergic rhinitis\n- nasal polyps\nTreating the underlying condition, if you have one, may help your catarrh.\nIt&#8217;s unclear what causes chronic catarrh, but it&#8217;s often the result of an allergy or infection. It may be linked to an:\n- abnormality in the way mucus travels within the nose\n- increased sensitivity to mucus in the back of the nose and throat"

        "disease": "Cerebral palsy",
        "description": "Cerebral palsy is a condition caused by either damage to the brain, or abnormal development of the brain. This damage normally occurs before birth or during a child&#8217;s early development. Cerebral palsy is not normally progressive in nature.\nCerebral palsy usually causes abnormal muscle tone and movement. The main types of abnormal muscle tone are:\nThis is the most common type of abnormal muscle tone. Someone with spastic cerebral palsy is likely to experience a tightening of the muscles throughout the body. This tightening can be persistent or intermittent. The amount of stiffness experienced will vary from person to person.\nIndividuals with this type of muscle tone may have dystonia or more rarely athetosis.\nThis describes a type of abnormal muscle control where the muscles can shift from tight to floppy without warning, resulting in involuntary movements.\nThis is the least common type of cerebral palsy. It can be identified by shaky movement and poor balance. Someone with ataxic cerebral palsy may struggle with fine motor movements and coordination, like writing or using cutlery. They may have a tremor that increases with activity, and struggle with balance. This can make standing or sitting in an upright position difficult.\nSomeone with mixed cerebral palsy may have signs of more than one type of abnormal muscle tone at the same time.\nThe symptoms of cerebral palsy can vary from person to person and are dependent on the type of brain injury or abnormality. Someone with cerebral palsy may:\n- struggle with movement and balance, and may be unable to walk\n- struggle to speak, and possibly need to use electronic aids\n- have difficulties with eating, drinking and swallowing\n- have problems with their vision\n- experience pain symptoms\n- experience&nbsp;fatigue&nbsp;(tiredness)\n- have problems with their sleep\n- have&nbsp;epilepsy\n- have a learning disability\n- display behavioural problems\n- have bladder control problems\n- have problems with their digestive system (constipation)\n- struggle to control their saliva\n- struggle to process information from their senses\nA person with cerebral palsy may have secondary symptoms. These are caused by the impact of the condition on their body, rather than directly by cerebral palsy. These can include:\n- tightness in joints and muscles\n- dislocations\n- a change in their physical abilities\n- changes in the amount of pain they experience\n- increased&nbsp;fatigue\nCerebral palsy is caused by damage to the brain during pregnancy, birth or early development.\nThere are some things that can increase the risk of a child developing cerebral palsy. These include:\n- premature birth (being born early)\n- neonatal encephalopathy (caused by lack of oxygen to the brain in pregnancy or around the time of birth)\n- stroke or bleeding in the baby&#8217;s brain during pregnancy or after birth\n- infection during pregnancy or after birth\n- meningitis\n- head injuries\nIt&#8217;s not always possible to tell why a child has developed cerebral palsy.\nA child can develop cerebral palsy despite their parents having done everything right during pregnancy and childbirth. The parents of a child with cerebral palsy are not to blame.\nThere isn&#8217;t one single test that can diagnose cerebral palsy. Your medical professional will need to see how your child develops over time to make a diagnosis. They may also use tests such as brain scans to confirm the diagnosis.\nWaiting for a diagnosis can be very stressful for parents. It&#8217;s natural to feel anxious when your child is unwell. NHS inform has advice on dealing with anxiety and stress, and information on where to go to find support for your mental wellbeing.\nRead more about mental wellbeing services\nMost children are diagnosed by two years old. Some children are diagnosed earlier if they&#8217;ve spent time in medical settings, for example children who were born premature.\nTo diagnose cerebral palsy, your medical professional will examine your child&#8217;s medical history, and how well they can move, balance, and react. They may also use scans like an&nbsp;MRI&nbsp;to see if there&#8217;s any sign of damage or abnormal development of the brain.\nWhile cerebral palsy is a non-progressive condition (it doesn&#8217;t normally get worse over time), it may not stay the same throughout life.

People with cerebral palsy often go on to live long, rich and rewarding lives.\nThere are resources and treatments available to help both children and adults with cerebral palsy. Everyone with cerebral palsy will have individual needs and these needs may change over time. Your healthcare professional will help you find treatments and resources that work for you or your child.\nTargeted physiotherapy can help you or your child improve and maintain posture, coordination, strength and balance. Physiotherapists may recommend specialist mobility equipment and advise about the use of orthotic splints.\nOccupational therapists help people who struggle to complete everyday tasks find new ways of completing them. They can show you or your child how to break down activities into smaller movements, helping build confidence. Occupational therapists also have good knowledge of the medical aids and technologies available to help you or your child.\nIf you or your child is struggling to talk, a speech and language therapist can help. They have a range of techniques that can help people improve at talking, like helping you or your child learn to shape a sound. Some speech therapists will recommend the use of specialist communication aids.\nIf you or your child is having issues with swallowing, a speech and language therapist can also help by performing an assessment and making recommendations.\nAn orthotic device is a piece of equipment that supports a part of the body. This can help improve you or your child&#8217;s ability to move and be active.\nOrthotics can help with a wide range of the physical problems that can be caused by cerebral palsy.

        "disease": "Cervical cancer",
        "description": "Cervical cancer is a type of cancer that develops in a woman&#8217;s cervix (the entrance to the womb from the vagina).\nCancer of the cervix often has no symptoms in its early stages. If you do have symptoms,&nbsp;the most common is unusual vaginal bleeding, which can occur after sex, in between&nbsp;periods or after the menopause.\nAbnormal bleeding doesn&#8217;t mean that you definitely have cervical cancer, but it should be investigated by your GP as soon as possible. If your GP thinks you might have cervical cancer, you should be referred to see a specialist within 2 weeks.\nRead more about the symptoms of cervical cancer&nbsp;and diagnosing cervical cancer\nCervical screening (also known as a smear test) is routinely offered to anyone with a cervix in Scotland, between the ages of 25 and 64, every 5 years.&nbsp;You may be recalled more often depending on your test results.\nThose on non-routine screening (where screening results have shown changes that need further investigation or follow up) will be invited up to 70 years of age.&nbsp;\nIf you have unusual discharge, or bleeding after sex, between periods or after the menopause, contact your GP practice. These symptoms are not usually caused by cancer but it&#8217;s important to have them checked.&nbsp;\nYou&nbsp;will be sent a letter confirming when your screening appointment is due. Contact your GP if you think you may be overdue for a screening appointment.\nRead more about cervical screening\nAlmost all cases of cervical cancer are caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV). HPV is a very common virus that can be passed on through any type of sexual contact with a man or a woman.\nThere are more than 100 different types of HPV, many of which are harmless. However, some types of HPV can cause abnormal changes to the cells of the cervix, which can eventually lead to cervical cancer.\nTwo strains of the HPV virus (HPV 16 and HPV 18)&nbsp;are known to be responsible for 70% of all cases of cervical cancer.&nbsp;These types of HPV infection don&#8217;t have any symptoms, so many women won&#8217;t realise they have the infection.\nHowever, it&#8217;s important to be aware that these infections are relatively common and most women who&nbsp;have&nbsp;them don&#8217;t develop cervical cancer.\nUsing condoms during sex offers some protection against HPV, but it can&#8217;t always prevent infection, because the virus is also spread through skin-to-skin contact of the wider genital area.\nSince 2008, a&nbsp;HPV vaccine&nbsp;has been routinely offered to girls aged 12 and 13.\nRead more about the causes of cervical cancer&nbsp;and preventing cervical cancer\nIf cervical cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, it&#8217;s usually possible to treat it using surgery. In some cases, it&#8217;s possible to leave the womb in place, but it&nbsp;may need to be removed. The surgical procedure used to remove the womb is&nbsp;called a hysterectomy.\nRadiotherapy is an alternative to surgery for some women with early-stage cervical cancer. In some cases, it&#8217;s used alongside surgery.\nMore advanced cases of cervical cancer are usually treated using a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.\nSome of the treatments used can have significant and long-lasting side effects, including early menopause&nbsp;and infertility.\nRead more about treating cervical cancer\nMany women with cervical cancer will have complications. These can arise as a direct result of the cancer or as a side effect of treatments such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy and&nbsp;surgery.\nComplications associated with cervical cancer can range from the relatively minor, such as minor bleeding from the vagina or&nbsp;having to urinate frequently, to life-threatening, such as severe bleeding or kidney failure.\nRead more about the complications of cervical cancer\nThe stage at which cervical cancer is diagnosed is an important factor in determining outlook. The staging, given as a number from 1 to 4, indicates how far the cancer has spread.\nThe chances of living for at least 5 years after being diagnosed with cervical cancer are:\n- stage 1 – 80-99%\n- stage 2 – 60-90%\n- stage 3 – 30-50%\n- stage 4 – 20%\nRead more about the staging of cervical cancer\nFollowing the success of the NHS Cervical Screening Programme and the early detection of cell changes, the number of cervical cancer cases in the UK has reduced. Around 3,000 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed in the UK each year.\nIt&#8217;s possible for women of all ages to develop cervical cancer, but the condition mainly affects sexually active women aged between 30 and 45. Cervical cancer is very rare in women under 25.\nThe symptoms of cervical cancer aren&#8217;t always obvious, and it may not cause any symptoms at all until it&#8217;s reached an advanced stage.\nThis is why it&#8217;s very important that you attend all of your cervical screening appointments.\nIn most cases, vaginal bleeding is the first noticeable symptom of cervical cancer. It usually occurs after having sex.\nBleeding at any other time, other than your expected monthly period is also considered unusual. This includes bleeding after the&nbsp;menopause (when a woman&#8217;s monthly periods stop).\nVisit your GP for advice if you experience any type of unusual vaginal bleeding.\nOther symptoms of cervical cancer may include pain and discomfort during sex and an unpleasant smelling vaginal discharge.\nIf the cancer spreads out of your cervix and into surrounding tissue and organs, it can trigger a range of other symptoms, including:\n- constipation \n- blood in your urine (haematuria)\n- loss of bladder control (urinary incontinence)\n- bone pain\n- swelling of one of your legs\n- severe pain in your side or back caused by swelling in your kidneys, related to a&nbsp;condition called hydronephrosis\n- changes to your bladder and bowel habits\n- loss of appetite\n- weight loss\n- tiredness and a lack of energy\nYou should contact your GP if you experience:\n- bleeding after sex (postcoital bleeding)\n- bleeding outside of your normal periods\n- new bleeding after the menopause\nVaginal bleeding is very common and can have a wide range of causes, so it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean you have cervical cancer. However, unusual vaginal bleeding is a symptom that needs to be investigated by your GP.\nIn almost all cases, cervical cancer is the result of a change in cell DNA caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV).\nCancer begins with a change in the structure of the DNA that&#8217;s present in all human cells. DNA provides the cells with a basic set of instructions, including when to grow and reproduce.\nA change in the DNA&#8217;s structure is known as a mutation. It can alter the instructions that control cell growth, which means the cells continue growing instead of stopping when they should. If the cells reproduce uncontrollably, they produce a lump of tissue called a tumour.\nMore than&nbsp;99% of cervical cancer&nbsp;cases occur in women who have been previously infected with HPV. HPV is a group of viruses, rather than a single virus. There are more than 100 different types.\nHPV is spread during sexual intercourse and other types of sexual activity (such as skin-to-skin contact of the genital areas, or using sex toys) and is thought to be very common.&nbsp;It&#8217;s estimated that 1 in 3 women will develop an HPV infection within 2 years of starting to have regular sex, and about 4 in 5&nbsp;women will develop the infection at some point in their lives.\nSome types of HPV don&#8217;t cause any noticeable symptoms and the infection will pass without treatment. Other types of HPV can cause genital warts, although these types aren&#8217;t linked to an increased risk of causing cervical cancer.\nAbout 15 types of HPV are considered high-risk for cervical cancer. The 2 types known to have the highest risk are HPV 16 and HPV 18, which&nbsp;cause about 7 out of every 10 cervical cancers.\nHigh-risk types of HPV are thought to contain genetic material that can be passed into the cells of the cervix. This material begins to disrupt the normal workings of the cells, which can eventually cause them to reproduce uncontrollably, leading to the growth of a cancerous tumour.\nAs most types of HPV don&#8217;t cause any symptoms, you or your partner could have the virus for months or years without knowing it.\nSee&nbsp;preventing cervical cancer for more information about reducing your chances of developing an HPV infection.\nCancer of the cervix usually takes many years to develop. Before it does, the cells in the cervix often show changes known as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or, less commonly, cervical glandular intraepithelial neoplasia (CGIN).\nCIN and CGIN are pre-cancerous conditions. Pre-cancerous conditions don&#8217;t pose an immediate threat to a person&#8217;s health, but they can potentially develop into cancer in the future.\nHowever, even if you develop CIN or CGIN, the chances of it developing into cervical cancer are very small, and if the changes are discovered during cervical screening, treatment is&nbsp;highly successful.\nThe progression from becoming infected with HPV to developing CIN or CGIN&nbsp;and then developing cervical cancer is very slow, often&nbsp;taking 10 to 20 years.\nRead more about cervical screening results\nThe fact that HPV infection is very common but cervical cancer is relatively uncommon&nbsp;suggests that only a very small proportion of women are vulnerable to the effects of an HPV infection. There appear to be additional&nbsp;risk factors that affect&nbsp;a woman&#8217;s chance of developing cervical cancer. These include:\n- smoking – women who smoke are twice as likely to&nbsp;develop cervical cancer than women who don&#8217;t; this may be caused by the harmful effects of chemicals found in tobacco on the cells of the cervix\n- having a weakened immune system –&nbsp;this can occur as a result of taking certain medications, such as immunosuppressants, which are used to stop the body rejecting donated organs, or as a result of a condition such as HIV or AIDS\n- taking the&nbsp;oral contraceptive pill for more than 5 years – women who take the pill are thought to have twice the risk of developing cervical cancer than those who don&#8217;t, although it&#8217;s not clear why\n- having children (the more children you have, the greater your risk) – women who have 2 children have twice the risk of getting cervical cancer compared&nbsp;with women who don&#8217;t have any children\nThe reason for the link between cervical cancer and childbirth is unclear. One theory is that the hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy may make the cervix more vulnerable to the effects of HPV.\nIf cervical cancer is undiagnosed and untreated, it will slowly spread out of the cervix&nbsp;and into the surrounding tissue and organs. The cancer can spread down to the vagina and the surrounding muscles that support the bones of the pelvis. Alternatively, it can spread upwards, blocking the tube that runs from your kidneys to your bladder (ureters).\nThe cancer&nbsp;can then spread into your bladder, rectum (back passage) and eventually into your liver, bones and lungs. Cancerous cells can also spread through your lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is a series of nodes (glands) and channels spread throughout your body in a similar way to the blood circulation system.\nThe lymph nodes produce many of the specialised cells needed by your immune system (the body&#8217;s natural defence against infection and illness). If you have an infection, the nodes in your neck or under your armpits can become swollen.\nIn some cases of early cervical cancer, the lymph nodes close to the cervix contain cancerous cells. In some cases of advanced cervical cancer, lymph nodes in the chest and abdomen can be affected.\nIf cervical cancer is suspected, you&#8217;ll be referred to a gynaecologist (a specialist in treating conditions of the female reproductive system).\nReferral will be recommended if the results of your cervical screening test suggest that there are abnormalities in the cells of your cervix. However, in most cases, the abnormalities don&#8217;t mean you have cervical cancer.\nYou may also be referred to a gynaecologist if you have abnormal vaginal&nbsp;bleeding, or if your GP has noticed a growth inside your cervix during an examination.\nThe sexually transmitted infection (STI) chlamydia is one of the most common reasons why women experience unusual vaginal bleeding. Your GP may recommend that you&#8217;re tested for it first before being referred. Testing for chlamydia involves taking a small tissue sample from your cervix, or carrying out a urine test.\nIf you&#8217;ve had an abnormal cervical screening test result, or your symptoms suggest that you may have cervical cancer, your gynaecologist will usually carry out a colposcopy. This is an examination to look for abnormalities in your cervix.\nDuring a colposcopy, a small microscope with a light source at the end (colposcope) is used. As well as examining your cervix, your gynaecologist may remove a small tissue sample (biopsy) so that it can be checked under a microscope for cancerous cells.\nIn some cases, a minor operation called a cone biopsy may also be carried out. The operation is carried out in hospital, usually under a local anaesthetic.\nDuring a cone biopsy, a small, cone-shaped section of your cervix will be removed so that it can be examined under a microscope for cancerous cells. You may experience vaginal bleeding for up to four weeks after the procedure. You may also have period-like pains.\nIf the results of the biopsy suggest you have cervical cancer and there&#8217;s a risk that the cancer may have spread, you&#8217;ll probably need to have some further tests to assess how widespread the cancer is. These tests may include:\n- a pelvic examination carried out under general anaesthetic – your womb, vagina, rectum and bladder will be checked for cancer\n- blood tests&nbsp;–&nbsp;these can be used to help assess the state of your liver, kidneys and bone marrow\n- computerised tomography (CT) scan&nbsp;– scans are taken of the inside of your body and a computer is used to assemble them into a detailed three-dimensional image; the CT scan can help to identify cancerous tumours and show whether cancerous cells have spread\n- magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan&nbsp;– this type of scan uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed pictures of the inside of your body; it can also be used to check whether cancer has spread\n- chest X-ray&nbsp;– this will indicate whether cancer has spread to your lungs\n- positive emission tomography (PET) scan&nbsp;–&nbsp;a specialised scan, where a mildly radioactive substance is injected into your veins so the cancerous tissue shows up more clearly; it&#8217;s often combined with a CT scan&nbsp;and is used to see if the cancer has spread, or to check how well a person is responding to treatment\nAfter all of the tests have been completed and your test results are known, it should be possible to tell you what stage cancer you have. Staging is a measurement of how far the cancer has spread. The higher the stage, the further the cancer has spread. The staging for cervical cancer is as follows:\n- stage 0 (pre-cancer) – there are no cancerous cells in the cervix, but there are biological changes that could trigger cancer in the future; this is called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or carcinoma in situ (CIS)\n- stage 1 – the cancer is still contained inside the cervix\n- stage 2 – the cancer has spread outside of the cervix into the surrounding tissue, but hasn&#8217;t reached the tissues lining the pelvis (pelvic wall) or the lower part of the vagina\n- stage 3 – the cancer has spread into the lower section of the vagina and/or into the pelvic wall\n- stage 4 – the cancer has spread into the bowel, bladder or other organs, such as&nbsp;the lungs\nTreatment for cervical cancer depends on how far the cancer has spread.\nAs cancer treatments are often complex, hospitals use multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) to treat cervical cancer and tailor the treatment programme to the individual.\nMDTs are made up of a number of different specialists who work together to make decisions about the best way to proceed with your treatment.\nYour cancer team will recommend what they think&nbsp;the best treatment options are, but the final decision will be yours. In most cases, the recommendations will be:\n- early cervical cancer – surgery to remove some or all of the womb,&nbsp;radiotherapy,&nbsp;or a combination\n- advanced cervical cancer – radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, although&nbsp;surgery is also sometimes used\nThe prospect of a complete cure is good for cervical cancer diagnosed at an early stage, although the chances of a complete cure decrease the further the cancer has spread.\nIn cases where cervical cancer isn&#8217;t curable, it&#8217;s often possible to slow its progression, prolong lifespan and relieve any associated symptoms, such as pain and vaginal bleeding. This is known as&nbsp;palliative care.\nIf your screening results show that you don&#8217;t have cervical cancer, but there are biological changes that could turn cancerous in the future, a number of treatment options are available. These include:\n- large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) – the abnormal cells are cut away using a fine wire and an electrical current\n- cone biopsy – the area of abnormal tissue is removed during surgery\n- laser therapy – a laser is used to burn away the abnormal cells\nRead more about treating abnormal cells in the cervix\nThere are 3 main types of surgery for cervical cancer. They are:\n- radical trachelectomy – the cervix, surrounding tissue and the upper part of the vagina are removed, but the womb is left in place\n- hysterectomy – the cervix and womb are removed; depending on the stage of the cancer, it may also be necessary to remove the ovaries and fallopian tubes\n- pelvic exenteration – a major operation in which the cervix, vagina, womb, bladder, ovaries, fallopian tubes and rectum are removed\nA radical trachelectomy is usually only suitable if cervical cancer is diagnosed at a&nbsp;very early stage. It&#8217;s usually offered to women who want to preserve their child-bearing potential.\nDuring the procedure, the surgeon will make a number of small incisions (cuts)&nbsp;in your abdomen. Specially designed instruments will be passed through the incisions and used to remove your cervix and the upper section of your vagina. Lymph nodes from your pelvis may also be removed. Your womb will then be reattached to the lower section of your vagina.\nCompared&nbsp;with a hysterectomy or pelvic exenteration,&nbsp;the advantage of this type of surgery&nbsp;is that your womb remains intact, which means that you may&nbsp;still be able to have children. However, it&#8217;s important to be aware that the surgeons carrying out this operation can&#8217;t guarantee you&#8217;ll still be able to have children.\nIf you do have children after the operation, your child would have to be delivered by&nbsp;caesarean section. It&#8217;s also usually recommended that you wait 6 to 12 months after having surgery before trying for a baby, so that your womb and vagina have time to heal.\nRadical trachelectomy is a highly skilled procedure. It&#8217;s only available at a number of specialist centres in the UK, so it may not be available in your area and you may have to travel to another city to be treated.\nA&nbsp;hysterectomy is usually recommended for early cervical cancer. This may be followed by a course of radiotherapy to help prevent the cancer coming back.\nThere are 2 types of hysterectomies used to treat cervical cancer:\n- simple hysterectomy – where the cervix and womb are removed and, in some cases, the ovaries and fallopian tubes are also removed; this is only appropriate for very early stage cervical cancers\n- radical hysterectomy – where the cervix, womb, surrounding tissue and lymph nodes, ovaries and fallopian tubes are all removed; this is the preferred option in advanced stage 1 and some early stage 2 cervical cancers\nShort-term complications of a hysterectomy include infection, bleeding, blood clots and accidental injury to your ureter, bladder&nbsp;or rectum.\nThe risk of long-term complications is&nbsp;small, but they can be troublesome. They include:\n- the risk that your vagina can&nbsp;become shortened and drier, which can make sex painful\n- urinary incontinence\n- swelling of your arms and legs, caused by a build-up of fluid (lymphoedema)\n- your bowel becomes obstructed&nbsp;because of&nbsp;a build-up of scar tissue&nbsp;– this may require further surgery to correct\nAs your womb is removed during a hysterectomy, you&#8217;ll no longer be able to have children.\nIf your ovaries are removed, it will also trigger the menopause&nbsp;if you haven&#8217;t already experienced it. See complications of cervical cancer for more information about the menopause.\nA pelvic exenteration is a major operation that&#8217;s usually only recommended when cervical cancer returns after what was thought to be a previously successful course of treatment. It&#8217;s offered if the cancer returns to the pelvis, but hasn&#8217;t spread beyond this area.\nA pelvic exenteration involves two phases of treatment:\n- the cancer is removed, plus your bladder, rectum, vagina and the lower section of your bowel\n- 2 holes called stomas are created in your abdomen&nbsp;– the holes are used to pass urine and faeces out of your body into collection pouches called colostomy bags\nFollowing a pelvic exenteration, your vagina can be reconstructed using skin and tissue taken from other parts of your body. This means you&#8217;ll be able to have sex after the procedure, although it may be several months until you feel well enough to do so.\nRadiotherapy&nbsp;may be&nbsp;used on its own or combined with surgery&nbsp;for early-stage&nbsp;cervical cancer. It may be combined with chemotherapy for advanced cervical cancer, where it can be used to control bleeding and pain.\nThere are 2 ways that radiotherapy can be delivered. These are:\n- externally – a machine beams high-energy waves into your pelvis to destroy cancerous cells\n- internally – a radioactive implant is placed inside your vagina and cervix\nIn most cases, a combination of internal and external radiotherapy will be used. A course of radiotherapy usually lasts for around 5 to 8 weeks.\nAs well as destroying cancerous cells, radiotherapy can sometimes also harm healthy tissue.&nbsp;This means it can cause significant side effects many months, and even years, after treatment.\nHowever,&nbsp;the benefits of radiotherapy often tend to outweigh the risks. For some people, radiotherapy offers the only hope of getting rid of the cancer.\nSide effects of radiotherapy&nbsp;are common and can include:\n- diarrhoea\n- pain when urinating\n- bleeding from your vagina or rectum\n- feeling very tired (fatigue)\n- feeling sick (nausea)\n- sore skin in your pelvis region&nbsp;similar to sunburn\n- narrowing of your vagina, which can make having sex painful\n- infertility\n- damage to the ovaries, which will usually trigger an early menopause (if you haven&#8217;t already experienced it)\n- bladder and bowel damage, which could lead to incontinence\nMost of these side effects will resolve within about eight weeks of finishing treatment, although in some cases they can be permanent. It&#8217;s also possible to develop side effects several months, or even years after treatment has finished.\nIf infertility is a concern for you, it may be possible to surgically remove eggs from your ovaries before you have radiotherapy, so that they can be implanted in your womb at a later date. However, you may have to pay for this.\nIt may also be possible to prevent early menopause by surgically removing your ovaries and replanting them outside&nbsp;the area of your pelvis that will be affected by radiation. This is known as an ovarian transposition.\nYour MDT can provide more information about the possible options for treating infertility and whether you&#8217;re suitable for an ovarian transposition.\nChemotherapy can be combined with radiotherapy to try&nbsp;to cure cervical cancer, or it can be used as a sole treatment for advanced cancer to slow&nbsp;its progression and relieve symptoms (palliative chemotherapy).\nChemotherapy involves using either a single chemotherapy medication called cisplatin or a combination of different chemotherapy medications to kill the&nbsp;cancerous cells.&nbsp;\nChemotherapy is usually given using an intravenous drip on an outpatient basis, so you&#8217;ll be able to go home once you&#8217;ve received your dose.\nAs with radiotherapy, these medications can also damage healthy tissue. Side effects are therefore&nbsp;common and can&nbsp;include:\n- nausea and vomiting\n- diarrhoea\n- feeling tired all the time\n- reduced production of blood cells, which can make you feel tired and breathless (anaemia) and vulnerable to infection because of a lack of white blood cells\n- mouth ulcers&nbsp;\n- loss of appetite\n- hair loss&nbsp;– your hair should grow back within three to six months of your course of chemotherapy being completed, although not all chemotherapy medications cause hair loss\nSome types of chemotherapy medication can damage your kidneys, so you may need to have regular&nbsp;blood tests to assess the health of your kidneys.\nAfter your treatment has been completed and the cancer has been removed, you&#8217;ll need to attend regular appointments for testing. This will usually involve a physical examination of your vagina and cervix (if it hasn&#8217;t been removed).\nAs there&#8217;s a risk of cervical cancer returning, these examinations will be used to look for signs of this. If anything suspicious is found,&nbsp;a further biopsy can be carried out.\nIf cervical cancer does return, it usually returns around 18 months after a course of treatment has been completed.\nFollow-up appointments are usually recommended every four months after treatment has been completed for the first 2 years, and then every 6 to 12 months for a further 3 years.\nComplications of cervical cancer can occur as a side effect of treatment or as the result of advanced cervical cancer.\nIf your ovaries are surgically removed or they&#8217;re damaged during treatment with radiotherapy, it will trigger an&nbsp;early menopause (if you haven&#8217;t already had it). Most women experience the menopause in their early fifties.\nThe menopause is caused when your ovaries stop producing the hormones oestrogen and progesterone. This leads to the following symptoms:\n- you no longer have monthly periods&nbsp;or your periods become much more irregular\n- hot flushes\n- vaginal dryness\n- loss of sex drive\n- mood changes\n- stress incontinence&nbsp;(leaking urine when you cough or sneeze)\n- night sweats\n- thinning of the bones, which can lead to brittle bones (osteoporosis)\nThese symptoms can be relieved by taking a number of medications that stimulate the production of oestrogen and progesterone. This treatment is known as&nbsp;hormone replacement therapy (HRT).\nRadiotherapy to treat cervical cancer can often cause your vagina to become narrower, which can make having sex painful or difficult.\nThere are 2 main treatment options if you have a narrowed vagina. The first is to apply hormonal cream to your vagina. This should increase moisture within your vagina and make having sex easier.\nThe second is to use a vaginal dilator, which is a tampon-shaped device made of plastic. You insert it into your vagina and is designed to help make it more supple. It&#8217;s usually recommended that you insert the dilator for 5 to 10 minutes at a time on a regular basis during the day over the course of 6 to 12 months.\nMany women find discussing the use of a vaginal dilator embarrassing, but it&#8217;s a standard and well-recognised treatment for narrowing of the vagina. Your specialist cancer nurse or radiographers in the radiotherapy department should be able to give you more information and advice.\nYou may find that the more times you have sex, the less painful it becomes. However, it may be several months before you feel emotionally ready to be intimate with a sexual partner.\nThe&nbsp;Macmillan Cancer Support website has more information about sex and side effects of cancer.\nIf the lymph nodes in your pelvis are&nbsp;removed, it can sometimes disrupt the normal workings of your lymphatic system.\nOne of the functions of the lymphatic system is to drain away excess fluid from the body&#8217;s tissue. A disruption to this process can lead to a build-up of fluid in the tissue known as lymphoedema. This can cause certain body parts to become swollen – usually the legs, in cases of cervical cancer.\nThere are exercises and massage techniques that can reduce the swelling. Wearing specially designed bandages and compression garments can also help.\nRead more about treating lymphoedema\nThe emotional impact of living with cervical cancer can be significant. Many people report experiencing a &#8216;rollercoaster&#8217; effect.\nFor example, you may feel down when you receive a diagnosis, but feel better when removal of the cancer has been confirmed. You may then feel down again as you try to come to terms with the after-effects of your treatment.\nThis type of emotional disruption can sometimes trigger depression. Typical signs of depression include feeling sad, hopeless and losing interest in things you used to enjoy.\nContact your GP if you think you may be depressed. There is a range of effective treatments available, including antidepressant medication and talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).\nLocal cancer support groups may also be available&nbsp;in your area for women affected by cancer. Your specialist cancer nurse should be able to provide contact details.\nRead more about&nbsp;feelings and&nbsp;cancer\nSome of the complications that can occur in advanced cervical cancer are discussed below.\nIf the cancer spreads into your nerve endings, bones or muscles, it can often cause severe pain.\nA number of effective painkilling medications can usually be used to control the pain. Depending on the levels of pain, they can range from paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, to more powerful opiate-based painkillers, such as codeine and morphine.\nTell your care team if the painkillers you&#8217;re prescribed aren&#8217;t effective in reducing your pain. You may need to be prescribed a stronger medication. A short course of radiotherapy may also be effective in controlling the pain.\nMacmillan nurses, who work both in hospitals and in the community, can also provide expert advice about pain relief.\nYour kidneys remove waste material from your blood. The waste is passed out of your body in urine&nbsp;through tubes called the ureters. Kidney function can be monitored by a simple blood test called serum creatinine level.\nIn some cases of advanced cervical cancer, the cancerous tumour can press against the ureters, blocking the flow of urine out of the kidneys. The build-up of urine inside the kidneys is known as&nbsp;hydronephrosis and can cause the kidneys to become swollen and stretched.\nSevere cases of hydronephrosis can cause the kidneys to become scarred, which can lead to the loss of most or all of the kidneys&#8217; functions. This is known as kidney failure.\nKidney failure can cause a wide range of symptoms, including:\n- tiredness\n- swollen ankles, feet or hands, caused by&nbsp;water retention\n- shortness of breath\n- feeling sick\n- blood in your urine (haematuria)\nTreatment options for kidney failure associated with cervical cancer include draining urine out of the kidneys using a tube inserted through the skin and into each kidney (percutaneous nephrostomy). Another option is to widen the ureters by placing a small metal tube called a stent inside them.\nAs with other types of cancer, cervical cancer can make the blood &#8216;stickier&#8217; and&nbsp;more prone to forming clots. Bed rest after surgery and&nbsp;chemotherapy can also increase the risk of developing a clot.\nLarge tumours can press on the veins in the pelvis, which slows the flow of blood and can lead to a blood clot developing in the legs.\nSymptoms of a blood clot in your legs include:\n- pain, swelling and tenderness in one of your legs (usually your calf)\n- a heavy ache in the affected area\n- warm skin in the area of the clot\n- redness of&nbsp;the skin, particularly at the back of your leg, below the knee\nA major concern in these cases is that the blood clot from the leg vein will travel up to the lungs and block the supply of blood. This is known as a&nbsp;pulmonary embolism and&nbsp;can be fatal.\nBlood clots in the legs are usually treated using a combination of blood-thinning medication, such as heparin or warfarin, and compression garments&nbsp;designed to help encourage the flow of blood through the limbs.\nRead more about treating deep vein thrombosis\nIf the cancer spreads into your vagina, bowel or bladder, it can cause significant damage, resulting in bleeding. Bleeding can occur in your vagina or rectum (back passage), or you may pass blood when you urinate.\nMinor bleeding can often be treated using a medication called tranexamic acid, which encourages the blood to clot and stop the bleeding. Radiotherapy can also be highly effective in controlling bleeding caused by cancer.\nMajor bleeding may be treated temporarily by vaginal packing (using gauze to stem the bleeding)&nbsp;and later by surgery, radiotherapy or by cutting off blood supply to the cervix.\nA fistula is an uncommon but distressing complication that occurs in around 1 in 50 cases of advanced cervical cancer.\nA fistula is an abnormal channel that develops between 2 sections of the body. In most cases involving cervical cancer, the fistula develops between the bladder and the vagina. This can lead to a persistent discharge of fluid from the vagina. A fistula can sometimes develop between the vagina and rectum.\nSurgery is usually required to repair a fistula, although it&#8217;s often not possible in&nbsp;women with advanced cervical cancer, because they&#8217;re usually too frail to withstand the effects of surgery.\nIn such cases, treatment often involves using medication, creams and lotions to reduce the amount of discharge and protect the vagina and surrounding tissue from damage and irritation.\nAnother uncommon, but distressing, complication of advanced cervical cancer is an unpleasant-smelling discharge from your vagina.\nThe discharge can occur for a number of reasons, such as the breakdown of tissue, the leakage of bladder or bowel contents out of the vagina, or a bacterial infection of the vagina.\nTreatment options for vaginal discharge include an antibacterial gel called metronidazole and wearing clothing that contains charcoal. Charcoal is a chemical compound that&#8217;s very effective in absorbing unpleasant smells.\nIf your doctors can&#8217;t do any more to treat your cancer, your care will focus on controlling your symptoms and helping you to be as comfortable as possible. This is called palliative care.\nPalliative care also includes psychological, social and spiritual support for you and your family or carers.\nThere are different options for terminal care in the late stages of cancer. You may want to think about whether you&#8217;d like to be cared for in hospital, in a hospice or at home, and&nbsp;discuss these issues with your doctor. Some organisations who provide care for people with cancer include:\n- Macmillan Cancer Support – which&nbsp;has specially trained nurses who help to look after people with cancer at home. To be referred to a Macmillan nurse, ask your hospital doctor or GP, or call 0808 808 00 00.\n- Marie Curie – have specially trained nurses who help to look after people with cancer at home. They also run hospices for people with cancer.\n- Hospice UK – provides information about hospice care and how to find a hospice.\nThe impact of cervical cancer on your daily life will depend on the stage of cancer and the treatment you&#8217;re having.\nMany women with cervical cancer have a radical hysterectomy. This is a major operation&nbsp;that takes around 6 to 12 weeks to recover from. During this time, you need to avoid strenuous tasks and lifting, such as&nbsp;lifting children&nbsp;or&nbsp;heavy shopping bags.\nYou won&#8217;t be able to drive for 3 to 8 weeks after the operation. Most women will also need 8 to 12 weeks off work to recover after having a radical hysterectomy.\nSome of the treatments for cervical cancer can make you very tired, particularly&nbsp;chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Because of this, you may need to take a break from some of your normal activities for a while.\nDon&#8217;t be afraid to ask for practical help from family and friends if you need it. Practical help may also be available from your local authority. Ask your doctor or nurse about who to contact.&nbsp;\nHaving cervical cancer doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean you&#8217;ll have to give up work, although&nbsp;you may need quite a lot of time off. During treatment, you may not be able to carry on as you did before.\nIf you have cancer, you&#8217;re covered by the Equality Act 2010. This means that your employer isn&#8217;t allowed to discriminate against you because of your illness. They have a duty to make &#8216;reasonable adjustments&#8217; to help you cope. Examples of these include:\n- allowing you time off for treatment and medical appointments\n- allowing flexibility with working hours, the tasks you have to perform, or your working environment\nThe definition of what&#8217;s &#8216;reasonable&#8217; depends on the situation, such as how much it would affect your employer&#8217;s business, for example.\nYou should give your employer as much information as possible about how much time you&#8217;ll need off and when. Speak to&nbsp;a member of your human resources department, if you have one. Your union or staff association representative can also give you advice.\nIf you&#8217;re having difficulties with your employer, your union or local Citizens Advice Scotland may be able to help.\nMacmillan Cancer Support&nbsp;also has more information and advice about work and cancer.\nIf you have to reduce or stop work because of your cancer, you may find it difficult to cope financially. If you have cancer or you&#8217;re caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to financial support. For example:\n- if you have a job but can&#8217;t work because of your illness, you&#8217;re entitled to&nbsp;Statutory Sick Pay from your employer\n- if you don&#8217;t have a job and can&#8217;t work because of your illness, you may be entitled to Employment and Support Allowance\n- if you&#8217;re caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to Carer&#8217;s Allowance\n- you may be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home or you have a low household income\nIt&#8217;s a good idea to find out what help is available as soon as possible. You could ask to speak to the social worker at your hospital, who can give you the information you need.\nMany women feel nervous about having sex soon after treatment for cervical cancer, but it&#8217;s perfectly safe.&nbsp;Sex won&#8217;t make the cancer come back and your partner can&#8217;t catch cancer from you.\nIf&nbsp;you want to, you can resume your normal sex life within a few weeks of finishing radiotherapy or having surgery. This will give your body time to heal.\nIf you&#8217;re having chemotherapy,&nbsp;male partners should wear a&nbsp;condom when you have sex, because it&#8217;s not clear if having sex after chemotherapy can have an effect on them.\nSome women find sex difficult after being treated for cervical cancer, because the&nbsp;side effects of some treatments can include vaginal dryness and narrowing of the vagina. In these cases, there are treatments that can help, such as vaginal dilators.&nbsp;\nSee complications of cervical cancer&nbsp;for more information\nThere&#8217;s no single way to completely prevent cervical cancer, but there are things that can reduce your risk.\nMost cases of cervical cancer are linked to an infection with certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV can be spread through unprotected sex, so using a&nbsp;condom can reduce your risk of developing the infection. However, the virus isn&#8217;t just passed on through penetrative sex – it can be transmitted during other types of sexual contact, such as skin-to-skin contact between genital areas and by using sex toys.\nYour risk of developing an HPV infection increases the earlier you start having regular sex and with the more sexual partners you have, although women who have only had 1 sexual partner can also develop it.\nRegular&nbsp;cervical screening&nbsp;is the best way to identify abnormal changes in the cells of the cervix at an early stage.\nCervical screening (also known as a smear test) is routinely offered to anyone with a cervix in Scotland between the ages of 25 and 64 every 5 years.\nYou may be recalled more often depending on your test results.\nMake sure that your GP surgery has your up-to-date contact details, so that you continue getting screening invitations.\nIt&#8217;s important that you attend your&nbsp;cervical screening&nbsp;tests, even if you&#8217;ve been vaccinated for HPV, because the vaccine doesn&#8217;t guarantee protection against cervical cancer.\nIf you&#8217;ve been treated for abnormal cervical cell changes, you&#8217;ll be invited for screening more frequently for several years after treatment. How regularly you need to go will depend on how severe the cell change is.\nAlthough it can identify most abnormal cell changes in the cervix, cervical screening isn&#8217;t always 100% accurate. Therefore,&nbsp;you should report symptoms such as unusual vaginal bleeding to your GP, even if you&#8217;ve recently been tested.\nThe NHS cervical cancer vaccination programme uses a vaccine called Gardasil. Gardasil protects against four types of HPV, including the 2 strains responsible for more than 70% of cervical cancers in the UK (HPV16 and HPV 18). It also prevents&nbsp;genital warts.\nGirls are offered the&nbsp;childhood immunisation programme. The vaccine is&nbsp;given to girls when they&#8217;re&nbsp;12&nbsp;to 13 years old, with 3 doses given&nbsp;over a 6-month period.\nAlthough the&nbsp;HPV vaccine can significantly reduce the risk of cervical cancer, it doesn&#8217;t guarantee that you won&#8217;t develop the condition. You should still attend cervical screening tests, even&nbsp;if you&#8217;ve had the vaccine.\nYou can reduce your chances of getting cervical cancer by not smoking. People who smoke are less able to get rid of the HPV infection from the body, which can develop into cancer.\nIf you decide to give up smoking, you&nbsp;could&nbsp;contact&nbsp;the Quit Your Way Scotland&nbsp;on&nbsp;0800 84 84 84.&nbsp;Quit Your Way Scotland&nbsp;is run by NHS 24 and is staffed by trained advisors who&#8217;ll be able to give you expert advice.\nIf you want to give up smoking, but you don&#8217;t want to be referred to a stop smoking service, your GP should be able to prescribe medical treatment to help with any withdrawal symptoms that you may experience after giving up.\nFor more information and advice on giving up smoking, see stopping smoking&nbsp;and treatments for stopping smoking."

        "description": "This information may be useful for those who have been diagnosed with cervical spondylosis. People who are experiencing new or ongoing symptoms should visit their healthcare professional for assessment, diagnosis or treatment.\nRead more about managing a neck problem\nCervical spondylosis is the medical term for neck pain caused by age-related changes to bones and tissues.\nApart from age, there are several other risk factors that may increase the likelihood of developing cervical spondylosis. These include:\n- lack of exercise or movement\n- sitting in a sedentary position for long periods\n- obesity\n- previous neck injuries or surgery\n- severe&nbsp;arthritis\nMany people experience no noticeable symptoms. It&#8217;s common to experience some or all of these symptoms including:\n- neck pain\n- stiffness\n- headaches&nbsp;which usually start at the back of the head, just above the neck, and travel over the top to the forehead.\nPain usually comes and goes, with flare-ups followed by symptom-free periods.\nRarely, it can irritate a nerve in the neck, which can cause symptoms such as pain and or altered sensation in your arm for example pins and needles or numbness. If any of these occur, it’s a good idea to talk to a health care professional.\nIn order for cervical spondylosis to be diagnosed you will need an assessment from a healthcare professional.\nThey&#8217;ll initially ask you questions about your neck issue and then carry out a physical examination. This&nbsp;may include checking your range of movement and strength.\nYou may sometimes need to have a further examination to rule out other possible health conditions.\nCervical spondylosis is a long term condition, and symptoms are often variable from day to day.  Many patients have found that managing their symptoms can help improve their quality of life.\nThere are some things you can do to help manage this condition yourself.\nRead more about exercises for cervical spondylosis\nCervical spondylosis&nbsp;can sometimes mean you need to take some time off work to help recovery.

        "disease": "Chest and rib injury",
        "description": "This information is for people who have sustained an injury to ribs or chest wall.\nChest and rib injuries are common and can be caused by:\n- a fall\n- a blow or impact to the chest or ribs\nMost injuries can be safely managed at home without the need to see a healthcare professional. For most rib or chest injuries, you&#8217;ll not need an X-ray.\nRib and chest injuries can cause a range of symptoms including:\n- pain\n- bruising\n- swelling\n- clicking in the chest\nYou may have some or none of these.\nIt&#8217;s typical with this type of injury to have increased pain when:\n- taking a deep breath\n- coughing\n- laughing\n- sneezing\n- moving a certain way\nThere are strategies to help manage this.\nYour risk of getting a chest infection is higher after a chest or rib injury. There&#8217;s lots you can do to minimise the chance of this happening.\nThere are lots of things you can do yourself to manage your injury and any pain you&#8217;re experiencing.\nManaging your pain is one of the most effective ways to prevent breathing problems. It&#8217;ll also help reduce your chance of developing a chest infection.\nRegular pain medication can help to reduce the pain. It can also help you take deep breaths and sleep more comfortably.\nIf over the counter medication is ineffective it&#8217;s a good idea to talk to your healthcare professional.\nMore about taking painkillers\nYou might need to change how you sleep. You might find it more comfortable to sleep in an upright position for the first few nights following a chest or rib injury.\nIf you wear a bra, you may want to try wearing it when sleeping as some people find this more comfortable.\nTo help prevent a chest infection it&#8217;s recommended you do some breathing exercises. These help your lungs expand fully.\nIt&#8217;s important to do this every hour you&#8217;re awake, at the beginning of your recovery.\nThis will be most beneficial if you can sit upright.\nAim to take a deep breath in, hold for three to four seconds and then a slow, relaxed breath out. Do this 3 times and then try a huff or cough.\nA huff is a fast breath out, like you would do to steam up and clean a pair of glasses.\nCoughing when you have a chest or rib injury can be painful. Use this technique to minimise pain and make sure your cough is effective to help clear your chest.\nRather than coughing as you would normally, try to use a &#8216;huff&#8217; instead.\nA huff is a fast breath out, like you would do to steam up and clean a pair of glasses.\nDoing 2 or 3 huffs at a time after breathing exercises, should help make it easier for you to cough up any phlegm. It may help to reduce your pain to hug a pillow or cushion to your chest as you do this.\nWatch the video to find out how to do these.\nKeeping active is an essential part of your treatment and recovery.\nIt&#8217;s important to try to keep moving as normally as possible during your recovery. It&#8217;s best to avoid long periods of bed rest where possible.\nYou can try to increase your activity gradually to help your recovery.\nGenerally, the first few days are the most painful and when your movement will be most limited. Initially, you should listen to your body and adapt your life to suit.\nToo much rest can slow down your recovery. As soon as you can, start moving and using the affected area.\nRemember a little activity is better than nothing. Continue to stay within acceptable pain limits but you don’t need to be pain free. Aim to do a little bit more each day or every few days.\nThis guide can help you to understand if you&#8217;re pacing your daily activities at the right level as you progress. It&#8217;ll also let you see how much pain or discomfort is acceptable.\nIt can be helpful to rate your pain out of 10 (0 being no pain, 10 being the worst pain you&#8217;ve ever had), for example:\n- 0 to 3 &#8211; minimal pain\n- 4 to 5 &#8211; acceptable pain\n- 6 to 10 &#8211; excessive pain\nActivity should not make your existing pain worse overall. Increasing activity can lead to increased discomfort as your body gets used to regaining your activity levels.\nAim to keep your pain within a rating of 0 to 5. If your pain gets above this level, you can change the level of activity by:\n- reducing the number of times you do a movement\n- reducing the pace of an activity\n- increasing rest time between activities\nMost of the healing happens between 6 to 8 weeks after your injury.\nIt&#8217;s normal to have aches and discomfort beyond this. This usually happens when you try activities you haven’t done for a while. It&#8217;s also normal for the area to be more sensitive for a while after the injury.\nYou should contact your insurance provider before driving. Your injury may affect your insurance.\nYou must be able to safely perform an emergency stop or manoeuvre. You should always be in full control of your vehicle.\nYour return to work will depend on the type of work you do and your employer. It may be possible to discuss a phased return to work or changed duties.\nYou don’t need to see a healthcare professional to return to work.\nKeep doing any activities you&#8217;re able to, as your pain allows. Gradually increase what you do.\nReduced flexibility and strength may make things more difficult to start with. This will get better as you slowly build up to all of your usual activities.\nFrustration or low mood after an injury is normal. As you get back to normal life this should get better.\nLoss of confidence is common after an injury.\nFurther advice about preventing falls\nIf your symptoms haven’t improved within 8 weeks of following this advice, it’s a good idea to talk to a healthcare professional."

        "disease": "Chest infection",
        "description": "Chest infections are common, especially after a cold or flu during autumn and winter.\nAlthough most are mild and get better on their own, some can be serious or even life-threatening.\nThe main symptoms of a chest infection can include:\n- a persistent cough\n- coughing up yellow or green phlegm (thick mucus), or coughing up blood\n- breathlessness or rapid and shallow breathing\n- wheezing\n- a high temperature (fever)\n- a rapid heartbeat\n- chest pain or tightness\n- feeling confused and disorientated\nYou may also experience more general symptoms of an infection, such as a headache, fatigue, sweating, loss of appetite, or joint and muscle pain.\nIf your GP is closed, phone 111.\nYour GP should be able to diagnose you based on your symptoms and by listening to your chest using a stethoscope (a medical instrument used to listen to the heart and lungs).\nIn some cases, further tests – such as a chest X-ray, breathing tests and testing phlegm or blood samples – may be needed.\nA chest infection is an infection of the lungs or airways. The main types of chest infection are bronchitis and pneumonia.\nMost bronchitis cases are caused by viruses, whereas most pneumonia cases are due to bacteria.\nThese infections are usually spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes. This launches tiny droplets of fluid containing the virus or bacteria into the air, where they can be breathed in by others.\nThe infections can also be spread to others if you cough or sneeze onto your hand, an object or a surface, and someone else shakes your hand or touches those surfaces before touching their mouth or nose.\nCertain groups of people have a higher risk of developing serious chest infections, such as:\n- babies and very young children\n- children with developmental problems\n- people who are very overweight\n- elderly people\n- pregnant women\n- people who smoke\n- people with long-term health conditions, such as asthma, heart disease, diabetes, kidney disease, cystic fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\n- people with a weakened immune system – this could be due to a recent illness, a transplant, high-dose steroids, chemotherapy or a health condition, such as an undiagnosed HIV infection\nRead more about the causes of bronchitis and the causes of pneumonia\nMany chest infections aren&#8217;t serious and get better within a few days or weeks. You won&#8217;t usually need to see your GP, unless your symptoms suggest you have a more serious infection.\nWhile you recover at home, there are things you can do to improve your symptoms.\nAvoid cough medicines, as there&#8217;s little evidence they work. Coughing actually helps you clear the infection more quickly by getting rid of the phlegm from your lungs.\nAntibiotics aren&#8217;t recommended for many chest infections, because they only work if the infection is caused by bacteria, rather than a virus.\nYour GP will usually only prescribe antibiotics if they think you have pneumonia, or you&#8217;re at risk of complications such as fluid building up around the lungs (pleurisy).\nIf there&#8217;s a flu outbreak in your local area and you&#8217;re at risk of serious infection, your GP may also prescribe antiviral medication.\nRead more about treating bronchitis and treating pneumonia\nThere are measures you can take to help reduce your risk of developing chest infections and stop them spreading to others.\nIf you smoke, one of the best things you can do to prevent a chest infection is to stop. Smoking damages your lungs and weakens your defences against infection.\nRead more information and advice about stopping smoking\nAlthough chest infections generally aren&#8217;t as contagious as other common infections, like flu, you can pass them on to others through coughing and sneezing.\nTherefore, it&#8217;s important to cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze, and to wash your hands regularly. Put tissues in the bin immediately.\nExcessive and prolonged alcohol misuse can weaken your lungs&#8217; natural defences against infections and make you more vulnerable to chest infections.\nTo keep your risk of alcohol-related harm low, the NHS recommends:\n- not regularly drinking more than 14 units of alcohol a week\n- if you drink as much as 14 units a week, it&#8217;s best to spread this evenly over 3 or more days\n- if you&#8217;re trying to reduce the amount of alcohol you drink, it&#8217;s a good idea to have several alcohol-free days each week\nRegular or frequent drinking means drinking alcohol most weeks. The risk to your health is increased by drinking any amount of alcohol on a regular basis.\nEating a healthy, balanced diet can help strengthen the immune system, making you less vulnerable to developing chest infections.\nRead more about healthy eating and tips on cutting down on alcohol\nIf you&#8217;re at an increased risk of chest infections, your GP may recommend being vaccinated against flu and pneumococcal infections (a bacterium that can cause pneumonia).\nThese vaccinations should help to reduce your chances of getting chest infections in the future.\nFlu and pneumococcal vaccinations are usually recommended for:\n- babies and young children\n- pregnant women (flu jab only)\n- people aged 65 and over\n- people with long-term health conditions or weakened immune systems"

        "disease": "Chickenpox",
        "description": "Chickenpox is a mild and common illness that mostly affects children but can be caught at any age.\nChickenpox (known medically as varicella) is caused by a virus called the varicella-zoster virus. It&#8217;s spread quickly and easily from someone who is infected.\nChickenpox is most common in children under the age of 10. Children usually catch chickenpox in winter and spring, particularly between March and May.\nChickenpox causes a rash of red, itchy spots that turn into fluid-filled blisters. They then crust over to form scabs, which eventually drop off.\nThe spots normally appear in clusters and tend to be:\n- behind the ears\n- on the face\n- over the scalp\n- on the chest and belly\n- on the arms and legs\nBut, the spots can be anywhere on the body, including:\n- inside the ears and mouth\n- on the palms of the hands\n- soles of the feet\n- inside the nappy area.\nThe rash starts as small, itchy red spots. These develop a&nbsp;blister&nbsp;on top and become very itchy after about 12 to 14 hours.\nAfter a day or two, the fluid in the blisters gets cloudy and they begin to dry out and crust over.\nAfter 1 to 2 weeks, the crusting skin will fall off naturally.\nNew spots can keep appearing in waves for 3 to 5 days after the rash begins. So, different groups of spots may be at different stages of blistering or drying out.\nBefore the rash appears, you or your child may have some mild&nbsp;flu-like symptoms, including:\n- feeling sick\n- a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or over\n- aching, painful muscles\n- headache\n- generally feeling unwell\n- loss of appetite\nThese symptoms, especially the fever, tend to be more common and worse in adults than in children.\nFor most children, chickenpox is a mild illness that gets better on its own.\nChickenpox tends to be more severe in adults than children. Adults have a higher risk of developing complications.\nYou or your child develop any abnormal symptoms, such as:\nor\nYou have been in contact with someone who has chickenpox, or you have chickenpox symptoms and:\nIf your GP is closed, phone 111.\nTell the receptionist you think it might be chickenpox before going in to a GP practice.\nThere is no treatment for chickenpox. But, you can get remedies from your pharmacy that can help symptoms. These include:\n- paracetamol&nbsp;to help bring down a fever\n- calamine lotion and cooling gels to ease itching.\nIn most children, the blisters crust up and fall off naturally within 1 to 2 weeks.\nAdults with chickenpox may be helped by taking antiviral medicine if its diagnosed early enough.\nYou should keep children off school or nursery until all their spots have crusted over. This will help stop chickenpox being spread.\nAdults with chickenpox should stay off work until all the spots have crusted over.\nChickenpox is infectious from 1 to 2 days before the rash starts. It stops being infectious when all the blisters have crusted over. This happens usually 5 to 6 days after the start of the rash.\nIf you or your child has chickenpox, try to keep them away from public areas. This will help them avoid contact with people who may not have had it.\nYou should especially stay away from people who are at risk of serious problems, such as:\n- newborn babies\n- pregnant women\n- anyone with a weakened immune system, (for example people having cancer treatment or taking steroid tablets)\nSome children and adults are at special risk of serious problems if they catch chickenpox. They include:\n- pregnant women\n- newborn babies\n- people with a weakened immune system\nThese people should speak to their GP as soon as they are exposed to the chickenpox virus or they develop chickenpox symptoms.\nThey may need a&nbsp;blood test&nbsp;to check if they are protected from (immune to) chickenpox.\nIf you&#8217;re pregnant, chickenpox can occasionally cause complications.\nChickenpox occurs in approximately 3 in every 1,000 pregnancies.\nYour risk of developing&nbsp;pneumonia&nbsp;is slightly higher if you&#8217;re pregnant, especially if you smoke. The further you are into your pregnancy, the more serious the risk of pneumonia tends to be.\nIf you get chickenpox while you&#8217;re pregnant, there is also a small but significant risk to your unborn baby.\nIf you get chickenpox during the first 28 weeks of your pregnancy, there is a risk that your unborn baby could develop a condition known as foetal varicella syndrome (FVS).\nThis syndrome is rare.\nFVS can cause serious complications, including:\n- scarring\n- eye defects, such as cataracts\n- shortened limbs\n- brain damage\nThere are also other risks from catching chickenpox after week 20 of pregnancy.\nIt&#8217;s possible that your baby may be born prematurely (before week 37 of the pregnancy).\nIf you are infected with chickenpox 7 days before or 7 days after giving birth, your newborn baby may develop a more serious type of chickenpox. In a few severe cases, this type of chickenpox can be fatal.\nOnce you have had chickenpox, you usually develop antibodies to the infection and become immune to catching it again.\nBut, the virus that causes chickenpox, the varicella-zoster virus, stays inactive in your body&#8217;s nerve tissues. This can come back later in life as an illness called shingles.\nIt&#8217;s possible to catch chickenpox from someone with shingles, but not the other way around.\nRead more about&nbsp;shingles.\nThere is a chickenpox vaccine, but it is not part of the routine childhood vaccination schedule.\nOnly children and adults who are more vulnerable to the complications of chickenpox will get offered the vaccine.\nIt may be possible to develop the infection after vaccination. There is also a chance that someone who has had the vaccine could develop chickenpox after coming into close contact with a person who has shingles."

        "disease": "Chilblains",
        "description": "Chilblains are small, itchy swellings on the skin that can appear after you&#8217;ve been in the cold.\nChilblains can be uncomfortable, but they usually get better on their own within a few weeks.\nChilblains most often affect the body’s extremities, such as the toes, fingers, heels, ears and nose.\nThey usually develop several hours after being in the cold.\nSymptoms of chilblains include:\n- a burning or itching feeling in the affected areas, which can get worse if you go into a warm room\n- swelling\n- the affected skin turning red or dark blue\n- in severe cases, the surface of the skin breaks, and sores or blisters develop\nDo not scratch your skin if you have chilblains. It can break easily and become infected.\nYou do not usually need to see a GP, as chilblains normally get better on their own within a few weeks.\nChilblains often get better on their own without treatment.\nA soothing lotion, such as calamine or witch hazel, can help relieve itching. A pharmacist can give you advice about the right product for you.\nIf your chilblains are severe and keep returning, your GP may prescribe a medication called nifedipine. You take nifedipine as a daily tablet or capsule. It works by relaxing the blood vessels, improving your circulation.\nNifedipine can help existing chilblains heal, or can be taken to stop them developing.\nChilblains are caused by an abnormal reaction to the cold. They’re common in the UK because the weather is damp and cold in the winter.\nSome people develop chilblains that last for several months every winter.\nWhen the skin is cold, blood vessels near its surface get narrower. If the skin is then exposed to heat, the blood vessels become wider. If this happens too quickly, blood vessels near the surface of the skin can’t always handle the increased blood flow. Blood can leak into the surrounding tissue, which may cause the swelling and itchiness of chilblains.\nSome people are more at risk of chilblains than others. This includes people with:\n- poor circulation\n- a family history of chilblains\n- regular exposure to cold, damp or draughty conditions\n- a poor diet or low body weight\n- lupus – a long-term condition that causes swelling in the body’s tissues\n- Raynaud’s phenomenon – a common condition that affects the blood supply to certain parts of the body, usually the fingers and toes\nPeople who smoke are more at risk of chilblains as nicotine constricts blood vessels.\nChilblains can also occur on areas of the feet exposed to pressure. For example, a bunion or a toe that’s squeezed by tight shoes.\nIf you’re more at risk of chilblains, you help prevent them by:\n- staying out of the cold where possible\n- looking after your feet\n- improving your circulation\nIf your skin gets cold, you should warm it up gradually. Heating the skin too quickly – for example, by placing your feet in hot water or near a heater – is one of the main causes of chilblains.\nIf you have severe or recurring chilblains, there’s a small risk of complications such as:\n- infection from blistered or scratched skin\n- ulcers forming on the skin\n- permanent discolouration of the skin\n- scarring of the skin\nIt’s often possible to avoid complications of chilblains.\nYou can reduce your risk of infection by:\n- cleaning any breaks in your skin with antiseptic\n- covering the area with an antiseptic dressing\n- changing the dressing every other day until your skin heals\nIf the skin does become infected, you may be prescribed antibiotics."

It&#8217;s one of the most common sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the UK.\nMost people with chlamydia don&#8217;t notice any symptoms and don&#8217;t know they have it. So it&#8217;s important to get tested if you think you&#8217;re infected.\nIf you do get symptoms, it&#8217;s usually 1 to 3 weeks after having unprotected sex. Some people don&#8217;t get symptoms until months later.\nIf you do develop symptoms, you may experience:\n- pain when peeing\n- unusual discharge from the vagina, penis or anus\n- pain in the lower tummy, bleeding after sex, and bleeding between periods\n- pain in the testicles\n- red, sticky eyes\nSometimes symptoms can disappear after a few days. Even if symptoms go away you may still have the infection and could pass it on.\nIf you think you might have chlamydia, get tested for free by:\n- booking an appointment at your local sexual health service (if you have symptoms)\n- contacting your GP practice for an appointment (if you have symptoms)\n- ordering a home test kit (if you do not have symptoms)\nServices available may vary depending on where you live.\nThe test for chlamydia is simple, painless and very reliable. It involves sending a sample from the area of the body thought to be infected to a lab for analysis.\nYou usually don&#8217;t have to be examined by a doctor or nurse and can often collect the sample yourself.\nThe 2 main ways the sample can be collected are:\n- using a swab – a small cotton bud is gently wiped over the area that might be infected, such as inside the vagina, throat, or inside the anus\n- urine sample (if you have a penis) – this is more accurate if it&#8217;s at least 1 or 2 hours after you last peed\nPeople who have had anal or oral sex may have a swab taken from their anus or throat.\nAntibiotics will treat the chlamydia infection.\nYou should avoid having sex until 1 week after you and your partner(s) have been treated. This includes oral sex and sex using a condom.\nIf chlamydia is left untreated you may pass it on to other sexual partners.\nIf chlamydia is left untreated in women, it can spread to the womb and cause a serious condition called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). This is a major cause of ectopic pregnancy and infertility in women.\nIf men are not treated, the infection may spread to the testicles and cause discomfort. This could affect your fertility.\nYou can get chlamydia by having unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex (sex without a condom). Other ways of getting chlamydia include:\n- sharing sex toys that aren&#8217;t washed or covered with a new condom each time they&#8217;re used\n- infected semen or vaginal fluid getting into your eye\nChlamydia can be passed from a pregnant woman to her baby during childbirth.\nAny sexually active person can get chlamydia. It&#8217;s most common in people under the age of 30.\nYou can have had chlamydia for a while without knowing.\nThe best way to reduce your risk of STIs is to practice safer sex. This means using a condom for vaginal, anal and oral sex.\nIf you have been diagnosed with chlamydia you should get tested for all STIs including:\n- gonorrhoea\n- syphilis\n- HIV"

        "disease": "Chronic fatigue syndrome",
        "description": "Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) or chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a long term (chronic) neurological condition that affects the nervous and immune systems.\nPeople with ME/CFS experience severe pain and fatigue associated with post-exertional malaise (PEM). This is when the body is not able to recover after using even small amounts of energy. This fatigue feels very different from ordinary tiredness. It might take a day or 2 to kick in after physical, mental, or emotional exertion.\nME/CFS affects more women than men, can affect children and adults of all ages and from all social and ethnic groups. It doesn&#8217;t go away with sleep or rest and affects everyday life. It can&nbsp;sometimes be diagnosed as post viral fatigue syndrome (PVFS).\nThe symptoms of&nbsp;the condition vary from person to person. There may be times when your symptoms improve and you&#8217;ll be able to do some normal everyday activities. At other times, symptoms may get worse, affecting your daily life.\nIf you experience new symptoms, talk to your GP or specialist as the new symptoms may be unrelated to ME/CFS. Women often find that symptoms worsen at different times in their menstrual cycle. Not everyone will experience all of the symptoms.\nPeople with ME/CFS experience severe pain, fatigue and a range of other symptoms associated with PEM. This is the body and brain’s inability to recover after using even small amounts of energy.\nSimple physical or mental activities, or combinations of activities, can leave people with ME/CFS feeling completely exhausted. It can also lead to an increase in other symptoms.\nOther symptoms of ME/CFS include:\n- feeling generally unwell\n- pain\n- broken sleep\n- problems with concentration, thinking and memory (‘brain fog’)\n- speech and language problems, including word-finding difficulties\n- poor temperature control\n- dizziness\n- being very sensitive to light and sound\n- nausea\n- loss of appetite\n- muscle pain (myalgia)\nRead more about the symptoms of ME/CFS\nFrustration, anxiety, low mood and depression are sometimes experienced by people with ME/CFS because of the impact of the condition and its symptoms on their lives. This does not mean that ME/CFS is a mental health condition.\nFurther research is needed to confirm what causes ME/CFS. There might be various factors involved and there may be a number of different types of the illness. These different sub-groups still need more research to be identified, including how they lead to different experiences of the condition and how it develops.\nME/CFS may appear suddenly or more slowly over time. It may follow an infection, typically, but not always, viral.\nOther possible triggers can be:\n- trauma\n- surgery\n- stressful major life events\nIn some cases, there may be no identifiable trigger.\nThere&#8217;s no single test to detect ME/CFS. A diagnosis is made after other possible known causes for symptoms have been excluded.\nThe earlier the illness is recognised, the sooner you can get help to manage your symptoms. Many people with ME/CFS find it helps to keep a diary of their symptoms so that they can take this to their GP or specialist.\nYour GP will usually:\n- do a physical and mental examination to rule out other conditions\n- ask about recent travel, tick or insect bites, unusual infections, and drug and alcohol use\n- review current medication\n- arrange tests\nThey may be able to make a diagnosis after 3 or 4 months of seeing a pattern of symptoms. Anyone suspected of having ME/CFS should be considered for routine blood tests to identify other possible illnesses. More investigation may be needed if the diagnosis remains in doubt.\nSome people with ME/CFS also have another long-term condition and it&#8217;s important that you talk to your GP about how to manage the symptoms of the 2 conditions.\nAlthough there&#8217;s no cure for ME/CFS, there are ways to help manage your symptoms.\nBecause of the complexity of the illness different things work for different people. Your GP may be able to support you through managing your individual symptoms.\nTo decide what treatment is right for you, you should look at the evidence, including published research and patient surveys. Make sure you fully understand what the treatment involves before you make a decision. You have the right to decline any treatment option you do not feel comfortable with.\nYour GP may suggest some of the following treatment options.\nYour GP may suggest reviewing and changing the medicines you take. They&#8217;ll consider other conditions you may already be receiving treatment for alongside the most important ME/CFS symptoms that need to be treated.\nYour GP may also need to consider the combined impact of medication for symptoms and possibly for managing other conditions, especially as sensitivity to medicine is a feature of ME/CFS. This could mean there may be issues around polypharmacy (use of many medications) for your healthcare professional to consider.\nYour illness might make it more difficult for you to eat the right balance of nutrients in your diet due to loss of appetite and food intolerances. Your GP may be able to advise you on how you can alter and adjust your diet.\nYour GP may work with you or refer you to another therapist to suggest aids, activities or support that can help you to recover or adjust.\nBalancing periods of activity and rest and noticing what activities demand most from you, can allow you to reduce the number of episodes of PEM.\nPacing yourself involves stopping activities before you feel the impact so that you have energy in reserve. It’s easy to do too much on a good day and then feel the impact later. It can take time to change your habits and stop doing something even while things are going well. However, doing this is key to managing your condition in the long term.\nCounselling can support you to adjust to the impact ME/CFS can have on your life. This does not mean that the condition itself is psychological.\nCBT should only be delivered by a healthcare professional with the right training and experience in CBT for ME/CFS. The 2021 NICE guidelines suggest that CBT might help some people with ME/CFS manage their symptoms.\nCBT can sometimes be used to help changes in mood that can come with having a long-term condition.\nAlternative or holistic therapies may provide some comfort but be cautious of any method that claims to offer a cure for ME/CFS.\nYou should discuss any alternative or holistic therapy with your GP before you try it. Until further research is done, no one can be certain whether someone with ME/CFS might benefit from alternative therapies.\nThere are some things that you can do for yourself to help you manage the condition. Small changes make a difference to your energy and mobility. This is called self-management.\nTo help with this, you might try:\nRecord what you do so that you can build a picture of what uses more energy and what activities you can ask others to do for you. This will show you if there are patterns of symptoms and when they appear during your day.\nThis is very important for managing ME/CFS. You may need some support and advice on what that might mean for you in terms of your physical, mental and emotional activities for resting.\nBeing open with people and asking for help when you need it before you&#8217;re exhausted is a key approach to managing your condition. Talking about how you&#8217;re feeling is important for long term health conditions because of the impact your symptoms have on the way you live your life. Talk to your GP about emotional support available to you.\nNot everyone will experience the same symptoms so it’s important not to compare people with ME/CFS. People with ME/CFS can have very different experiences of the condition and how long their symptoms last.\nThe impact of symptoms can be:\n- mild\n- moderate\n- severe\n- very severe\nAs symptoms change over time so does the impact they have on people’s lives.\nMost people with ME/CFS improve over time, although some people don&#8217;t make a full recovery. It&#8217;s also likely there will be periods when symptoms get better or worse. Children and young people with ME/CFS are more likely to recover fully.\nME/CFS can have a significant emotional and financial impact on your life. A lack of understanding and awareness about ME/CFS means patients can experience disbelief, and even discrimination, from friends, family, health and social care professionals and employers.\nInformation on entitlements to welfare benefits, accessing health and social care and others sources of support for patients and carers are available from Action for M.E. They also offer resources and services for children and young people affected by ME/CFS and their families.\nIn some regions of Scotland there are local support groups providing peer support, information and advice. ALISS and Action for ME can assist with signposting to these groups."

It&#8217;s usually detected at earlier stages by blood and urine tests.\nThe main symptoms of advanced kidney disease include:\n- tiredness\n- swollen ankles, feet or hands (due to water retention)\n- shortness of breath\n- nausea\n- blood in the urine\nRead more about the symptoms of chronic kidney disease\nChronic kidney disease is most frequently diagnosed through blood and urine tests.\nIf you&#8217;re at a high risk of developing CKD, you may be screened annually. Screening may be recommended if you have:\n- high blood pressure&nbsp;(hypertension)\n- diabetes\n- a family history of CKD\nRead more about diagnosing chronic kidney disease\nThe kidneys are 2 bean-shaped organs, the size of your fist. They&#8217;re located on either side of the body, just beneath the ribcage. The main role of the kidneys is to filter waste products from the blood before converting them into urine. The kidneys also:\n- help maintain blood pressure&nbsp;\n- maintain the correct levels of chemicals in your body which, in turn, will help&nbsp;heart and muscles function properly\n- produce the active form of vitamin D that keeps bones healthy&nbsp;\n- produce a substance called erythropoietin, which stimulates production of red blood cells\nChronic kidney disease is the reduced ability of the kidney to carry out these functions in the long-term. This is most often caused by damage to the kidneys from other conditions, most commonly diabetes and high blood pressure.\nRead more about the causes of chronic kidney disease\nCKD is common and&nbsp;mainly associated with ageing. The older you get, the more likely you are to have some degree of kidney disease.\nIt&#8217;s estimated that about 1 in 5 men and 1 in 4 women between the ages of 65 and 74 has some degree of CKD.\nCKD is more common in people of south Asian origin (those from India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan) and black people than the general population. The reasons for this include higher rates of diabetes in south Asian&nbsp;people and higher rates of high blood pressure in African or Caribbean people.\nThere is no cure for chronic kidney disease, although treatment can slow or halt the progression of the disease and can prevent other serious conditions developing.\nPeople with CKD are known to have an increased risk of a heart attack because of changes that occur to the circulation.\nIn&nbsp;a&nbsp;minority of people, CKD may cause kidney failure, also known as established renal failure (ERF) or end-stage kidney disease. In this situation, the usual functions of the kidney stop working.\nTo survive, people with ERF may need to have artificial kidney treatment, called dialysis, or a kidney transplant.\nRead more about treating chronic kidney disease\nA kidney transplant from a living donor can be planned to avoid or reduce the time someone is on dialysis. This can offer a better long term outcome for the person receiving the organ.\nThere are 2 types of living kidney donation:\n- directed donation – a person can donate a kidney to someone they know, like a family member or a friend\n- altruistic kidney donation – a person can donate a kidney anonymously to someone they do not know\nFurther information about living donation.\nBeing diagnosed with chronic kidney disease can be worrying, but support and advice are available to help you cope.\nRead more about living with chronic kidney disease\nThe main way to reduce the chances of CKD developing is to ensure any existing conditions, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, are carefully managed.\nSome lifestyle changes can also reduce the risk of CKD developing, these include:\n- having a healthy diet\n- avoiding drinking excessive amounts of alcohol\n- exercising regularly\n- avoiding medicines that can damage the kidney\nRead more about preventing chronic kidney disease\nMost people with CKD have no symptoms because the body can tolerate even a large reduction in kidney function.\nIn other words, we are born with a lot more kidney function than is necessary for survival. Kidney function is often sufficient if only 1 kidney is working. That is why people can give a kidney to someone needing a kidney transplant.\nA change in kidney function is usually discovered through a routine blood or urine test. If you are diagnosed with kidney disease, your kidney function will be monitored with regular blood and urine&nbsp;tests, and treatment aims to keep any symptoms to a minimum.\nIf the kidneys continue to lose function and there is progression towards kidney failure (established renal failure or ERF), this will usually be tracked by blood tests and monitoring. If kidney failure does occur, the symptoms may include:\n- weight loss and poor appetite\n- swollen ankles, feet or hands (due to water retention)&nbsp;\n- shortness of breath&nbsp;\n- blood or protein in your urine (protein in your urine is not something you will notice as it can only be detected during a urine test)&nbsp;\n- an increased need to urinate, particularly at night&nbsp;\n- insomnia\n- itchy skin&nbsp;\n- muscle cramps\n- high blood pressure (hypertension)\n- nausea&nbsp;\n- erectile dysfunction in men&nbsp;(an inability to get or maintain an erection)\nThese are general symptoms and can be caused by many less serious conditions. Many of the symptoms&nbsp;above can be avoided if treatment begins at an early stage, before any symptoms appear.\nIf you are worried by any of these symptoms, arrange to see your GP.\nKidney disease is most often caused by other conditions that put a strain on the kidneys.\nHigh blood pressure (hypertension) and diabetes are the most common causes of kidney disease.\nBlood pressure is a measure of the pressure your heart generates in your arteries with each pulse. Too much pressure can damage your body&#8217;s organs, leading to heart disease, stroke and worsening of kidney function.\nThe cause of around 90% of cases of high blood pressure is unknown. There appears to be a link between the condition and a person’s general health, diet, and lifestyle.\nKnown risk factors for high blood pressure include:\n- age (the risk of developing high blood pressure increases as you get older)&nbsp;\n- family history of high blood pressure (the condition seems to run in families)&nbsp;\n- being of African-Caribbean or south Asian origin&nbsp;\n- obesity&nbsp;\n- lack of exercise&nbsp;\n- smoking\n- excessive alcohol consumption&nbsp;\n- high amount of salt in your diet\n- high-fat diet&nbsp;\n- stress\nHypertension causes damage by putting strain on the small blood vessels in the kidneys. This prevents the filtering process from working properly.\nDiabetes is a condition in which the body produces no – or too little – insulin (type 1 diabetes) or has become unable to make effective use of insulin (type 2 diabetes).\nInsulin is needed to regulate&nbsp;levels of glucose (sugar) in your blood, preventing the levels going too high after a meal and too low between meals.\nIf diabetes is poorly controlled, too much glucose can build up in your blood. The glucose can damage the tiny filters in the kidneys, which affects the ability of your kidneys to filter out waste products and fluids.\nIt is estimated that 20% to 40% of people with type 1 diabetes will develop kidney disease before they reach 50 years of age. Around 30% of people with type 2 diabetes also show signs of developing kidney damage.\nThe first sign of diabetic kidney disease is the appearance of low levels of protein in the urine. Therefore, your GP will ask for an annual urine test so any kidney disease can be detected as early as possible.\nAll people with diabetes should have a kidney check every year. Early detection of kidney dysfunction in diabetes is important because it identifies people at risk or complications, such as eye problems and impotence.\nThere are many other conditions that less commonly cause CKD, including:\n- glomerulonephritis (inflammation of the kidney)&nbsp;\n- pyelonephritis (infection in the kidney)&nbsp;\n- polycystic kidney disease (an inherited condition where both kidneys are larger than normal due to the gradual growth of masses of cysts)&nbsp;\n- failure of normal kidney development in an unborn baby while developing in the womb\n- systemic lupus erythematosus (a condition of the immune system where the body attacks the kidney as if it were foreign tissue)\n- long-term, regular use of medicines, such as lithium and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin and ibuprofen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n- blockages, for example due to kidney stones or prostate disease\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) is most frequently diagnosed through blood and urine tests.\nIf you are in a high-risk group for developing CKD, it is important&nbsp;to be regularly screened for the condition. People who are not in a high-risk group are not normally screened for CKD.\nAnnual screening is recommended for the following groups:\n- people with high blood pressure (hypertension)&nbsp;\n- people with diabetes \n- people with&nbsp;acute kidney injury caused by medications such as lithium or NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, kidney stones or an enlarged prostate\n- people with cardiovascular disease (conditions that affect the heart, arteries and veins, such as coronary heart disease or heart failure)&nbsp;\n- people with a family history of stage 5 CKD (see below for more information about staging) or an inherited kidney disease\n- people with diseases that affect several parts of the body and may affect the kidneys, such as systemic lupus erythematosus\n- people with blood in the urine (haematuria) or protein in the urine (proteinuria) where there is no known cause\nYour GP can advise you about whether or not you should be screened for CKD.\nMost often, the diagnosis of kidney disease is made because a routine blood or urine test indicates the kidneys may not be functioning normally. If this happens, the test is usually repeated to&nbsp;confirm the diagnosis.\nAn effective way of assessing how well your kidneys are working is to calculate your glomerular filtration rate (GFR). GFR is a measurement of how many millilitres (ml) of waste fluid your kidneys can filter from the blood in a minute (measured in ml/min). A healthy pair of kidneys should be able to filter more than 90ml/min.\nIt is difficult to measure the GFR directly, so it is estimated using a formula. The result is called the estimated GFR or eGFR. Calculating your eGFR involves taking a blood sample and measuring the levels of a waste product called creatinine and taking into account your age, gender and ethnic group. The result is similar to the percentage of normal kidney function. For example, an eGFR of 50ml/min equates to 50% kidney function.\nThe following tests are used to detect proteinuria (protein in the urine)\n- urine tests – used to see whether there is blood or protein in your urine\n- albumin and creatinine testing – this is another urine test which compares the amounts of albumin (a protein) and creatinine in your urine, and the ratio of the 2 (the albumin:creatinine ratio or ACR) can be used with eGFR to give doctors a more accurate idea of how the kidneys are functioning\nA 6-stage system, based on eGFR levels, is used to describe the progression of CKD. The higher the stage, the more severe the CKD.\nStage 1 (sometimes called G1): the eGFR is normal (above 90 or more), but other testing shows evidence of kidney damage.\nStage 2 (G2): the eGFR has decreased slightly (60 to 89), but is still considered to be in the normal range for a young adult.\nIf you have stage 1 or 2 CKD, it is recommended you have annual eGFR tests so the progression of the condition can be carefully monitored.\nStage 3 is divided into 2: stage 3a (G3a) and 3b (G3b). In stage 3a, the eGFR has decreased mildly (45 to 59) and this is termed a mild to moderate decrease in kidney function and should be checked annually. In stage 3b (G3b) it has decreased moderately (30 to 44) and is termed a moderate to severe reduction in kidney function and should be checked every 6 months.\nStage 4 (G4): the eGFR has reduced severely (15 to 29). By this time, it is possible you will be experiencing symptoms of CKD. Further testing should be carried out every 6 months.\nStage 5 (G5): the kidneys have lost almost all of their function (an eGFR of below 15), which is known as established renal failure. Further testing should be carried out every 3 months.\nHowever, over time, GFR can fluctuate, so one abnormal test result does not automatically mean you have CKD. A diagnosis of CKD is usually only confirmed if repeated eGFR tests show your eGFR is consistently lower than normal over 3 months.\nOther tests are also used to assess the levels of damage to your kidneys:\n- kidney scans, such as an ultrasound scan, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan or a computerised tomography (CT) scan, are used to find out whether there are any unusual blockages in your urine flow – in cases of advanced kidney disease, the kidneys are shrunken and have an uneven shape\n- kidney biopsy – a small sample of kidney tissue is taken so that the cells can be examined under a microscope for damage\nThe following lifestyle changes are known to help reduce your blood pressure and help control CKD:\n- stopping smoking\n- eating a healthy, low-fat, balanced diet&nbsp;\n- restricting your salt intake to less than 6g (0.2oz) a day\n- not&nbsp;using over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, except when advised to by a medical professional\n- moderating your alcohol intake so it is within recommended limits\n- losing weight if you are overweight or obese&nbsp;\n- doing regular exercise for at least 30 minutes a day, 5 times a week\nRead&nbsp;more about preventing high blood pressure&nbsp;through lifestyle changes.\nOne of the main ways to reduce the progression of kidney damage is to manage high blood pressure. Good control of blood pressure is&nbsp;vital to protect the kidneys.\nPeople with CKD should aim to get their blood pressure down to below 140/90mmHg but if you also have diabetes you should aim to get it down to below 130/80mmHg.\nThere are many types of blood pressure drugs.&nbsp;Medicines called angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are used to control high blood pressure in people with CKD.\nAs well as reducing blood pressure around the body and reducing the strain on blood vessels,&nbsp;ACE inhibitors&nbsp;give additional protection to the kidney.\nACE inhibitors include:\n- ramipril&nbsp;\n- enalapril&nbsp;\n- lisinopril&nbsp;\n- perindopril\nSide effects of ACE inhibitors include:\n- a persistent, dry cough&nbsp;\n- dizziness&nbsp;\n- tiredness or weakness&nbsp;\n- headaches\nMost of these side effects should pass within a few days, although some people continue to have a dry cough.\nIf the side effects of ACE inhibitors are particularly troublesome, you can be given an alternative medication called an angiotensin-II receptor blocker (ARB).&nbsp;This group of medicines includes:\n- candesartan\n- eprosartan\n- irbesartan\n- azilsartan\n- olmesartan\n- temisartan\n- valsartan\n- losartan\nThe side effects of ARBs are uncommon, but can include dizziness.\nBoth ACE inhibitors and ARBs can cause a reduction in kidney function in some people&nbsp;and increased levels of potassium in the blood, so blood tests will need to be performed after you start treatment and whenever the dose changes. If you are on an ACE inhibitor or ARB and you develop a fever/infection or need medicines for other conditions, it&#8217;s important to ask your doctor if the ACE inhibitor or ARB needs to be temporarily stopped.\nStudies have shown that people with CKD have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks and strokes. This is because some of the risk factors for CKD are the same as those for heart attacks and strokes, including high blood pressure and high levels of cholesterol in the blood (atherosclerosis).\nStatins are a type of medication used to lower cholesterol levels. Cholesterol causes narrowing of the arteries that can lead to a blockage of the blood supply to the heart (causing a heart attack) or the brain (causing a stroke). Statins work by blocking the effects of an enzyme in your liver (called HMG-CoA reductase), which is used to make cholesterol.\nStatins sometimes have mild side effects, including:\n- constipation\n- diarrhoea&nbsp;\n- headaches&nbsp;\n- abdominal pain\nOccasionally, statins can cause muscle pain, weakness and tenderness. If you experience any of these symptoms, contact your GP. You&nbsp;may need to have a blood test or change your treatment.\nIf you have kidney disease, you may be asked to reduce your daily fluid and salt intake. You may develop a build-up of fluid as your kidneys will not be able to get rid of fluid as well as they did before.\nIf you are asked to reduce the amount of fluid you drink, you must also take into account fluid in foods, such as soup and yoghurt. Your GP or dietitian can advise you about this.\nThe excess fluid that occurs as a result of kidney disease often builds up in your ankles or around your lungs. You may also be given diuretics (water tablets), such as furosemide, which will help get rid of the excess fluid from your body.\nIf you do not have any fluid retention and you&nbsp;have not&nbsp;been told&nbsp;to reduce your fluid intake, there is no need to do so.&nbsp;In fact, it could be harmful in some circumstances.\nMany people with stage three, four and five CKD develop anaemia. Anaemia is a condition in which you do not have enough red blood cells. Symptoms of anaemia include:\n- tiredness&nbsp;\n- lethargy&nbsp;\n- shortness of breath (dyspnoea)&nbsp;\n- palpitations (awareness of heartbeat)&nbsp;\nAnaemia can occur because of many other conditions and your doctor will investigate to rule out&nbsp;other possible causes.\nMost people with kidney disease will be given iron supplements because iron is needed for the production of red blood cells. To boost iron levels, iron may be given as tablets, such as daily ferrous sulphate tablets, or as occasional intravenous infusions.\nIf this is not enough to treat anaemia, you may be started on injections of erythropoietin, a hormone which helps your body produce more red blood cells. These injections are often administered into a vein (intravenously)&nbsp;or under the skin (subcutaneously). Examples of these injections include epoetin alfa, beta and zeta, darbepoetin and methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta.\nIf you have stage 4 or 5 kidney disease, you can get a build-up of phosphate in your body because your kidneys cannot get rid of it. Phosphate is a mineral that, with calcium, makes up most of your bones. Phosphate is obtained through diet, mainly dairy foods. The kidneys usually filter out excess phosphate. If phosphate levels rise too much, it can upset the normal calcium balance of the body. This can lead to thinning of the bones and furring of the arteries.\nYou may be asked to limit the amount of phosphate in your diet. Foods&nbsp;high in phosphate include red meat, dairy produce, eggs and fish. Your GP or dietitian should be able to advise you about how much phosphate you can eat. However, there is no advantage in reducing your intake of these foods unless you have a raised phosphate level.&nbsp;Always ask&nbsp;a healthcare professional before changing your diet.\nIf reducing the amount of phosphate in your diet does not lower your phosphate level enough, you may be given medicines called phosphate binders. These medicines bind to the phosphate in the food inside your stomach and stop it from being absorbed into your body.\nTo work properly, phosphate binders must be taken just before meals. The most commonly used phosphate binder&nbsp;is calcium carbonate, but there&nbsp;are also alternatives that may be more suitable for&nbsp;you.\nThe side effects of phosphate binders are uncommon but include:\n- nausea&nbsp;\n- stomach ache&nbsp;\n- constipation&nbsp;\n- diarrhoea&nbsp;\n- flatulence (wind)&nbsp;\n- skin rash&nbsp;\n- itchy skin\nPeople with kidney disease can have low levels of vitamin D, necessary for healthy bones. This is because the kidneys need to activate the vitamin D from food and&nbsp;the sun before it can be used by the body.\nMany people with kidney failure can continue with treatment using medicines and will have good-functioning kidneys for the rest of their lives.\nIn a few people, kidney disease will progress to the stage where the kidneys&nbsp;stop working and it becomes life threatening. This is called kidney failure or established renal failure (ERF).\nThis rarely&nbsp;happens suddenly, and there will be time to plan the next stage of your condition. The decision whether to have dialysis, a kidney transplant or supportive treatment should be discussed with your healthcare team.\nRead more about dialysis&nbsp;and&nbsp;kidney transplants.\nIf you decide not to have dialysis or a transplant for kidney failure, or they are not suitable for you,&nbsp;you will be offered supportive treatment.\nThis is also called palliative care.\nThe aim is to treat and control the symptoms of kidney failure without using dialysis or transplantation. Supportive treatment includes medical, psychological and practical care for both the person with kidney failure and their family, including discussion about how you feel and planning for the end of life.\nMany people choose supportive treatment because they:\n- are unlikely to benefit or have quality of life with treatment\n- do not want to go through the inconvenience of treatment with dialysis\n- are advised against dialysis because they have other serious illnesses that will shorten their life, and the negative aspects of treatment outweigh any likely benefits&nbsp;\n- have been on dialysis but have decided to stop this treatment&nbsp;\n- are being treated with dialysis, but have another serious physical illness, especially severe heart disease or stroke, that will shorten their life\nIf you choose to have supportive treatment, your kidney unit will still look after you.\nDoctors and nurses will make sure you receive:\n- medicines to protect your remaining kidney function&nbsp;for as long as possible&nbsp;\n- medicines to treat other symptoms of kidney failure, such as feeling out of breath, anaemia, loss of appetite or itchy skin&nbsp;\n- help&nbsp;to plan your home and money affairs&nbsp;\n- bereavement support for your family after your death\nRead more information:\n- Kidney Research UK: Information on choosing not to start dialysis\n- Bereavement support from&nbsp;CRUSE\nKidney disease services should:\n- identify people at risk of kidney disease, especially people with high blood pressure or diabetes, and treat them as early as possible to maintain their kidney function&nbsp;\n- give people access to investigative treatment and follow them up to reduce the risk of the disease getting worse&nbsp;\n- give people good-quality information about managing their condition&nbsp;\n- provide information about the development of the disease and treatment options&nbsp;\n- provide access to a specialist renal (kidney) team&nbsp;\n- give people access to transplant or dialysis&nbsp;services if required\n- provide supportive care\nYour treatment for kidney disease will need to be reviewed regularly.\nIt may be helpful for you to make a care plan because this can help you manage your day-to-day health. Your kidney disease specialist nurse may be able to help with this.\nIn most cases, chronic kidney disease (CKD) cannot be completely prevented, although you can take steps to reduce the chances of the condition developing.\nIf you have a chronic (long-term) condition, such as diabetes, that could potentially cause chronic kidney disease, it is important&nbsp;it is carefully managed.\nFollow the advice of your GP and keep all appointments relating to your condition. People with diabetes are advised to have their kidney function tested every year.\nRead more about Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes\nSmoking increases your risk of cardiovascular disease, including&nbsp;heart attacks or strokes, and it can increase the likelihood that any existing kidney problems will get worse.\nIf you stop smoking, you will improve your general health and reduce your risk of developing other serious conditions, such as lung cancer and heart disease.\nThe NHS smoking helpline can offer you advice and encouragement to help you quit smoking. Phone Quit Your Way Scotland on 0800 84 84 84.\nRead more&nbsp;about stopping smoking\nA healthy diet is important for preventing chronic kidney disease. It will lower the amount of cholesterol in your blood and keep your blood pressure at a healthy level. Eat a balanced diet that includes plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (5 a day) and whole grains.\nLimit the amount of salt in your diet to no more than 6g (0.2oz) a day. Too much salt will increase your blood pressure. One teaspoonful of salt is equal to about 6g.\nAvoid eating foods high in saturated fat because this will increase your cholesterol level.\nFoods high in saturated fat include:\n- meat pies&nbsp;\n- sausages and fatty cuts of meat&nbsp;\n- butter&nbsp;\n- ghee (a type of butter often used in Indian cooking)&nbsp;\n- lard&nbsp;\n- cream&nbsp;\n- hard cheese&nbsp;\n- cakes and biscuits&nbsp;\n- foods that contain coconut oil or palm oil\nEating some foods that are high in unsaturated fat can help decrease your cholesterol level. Foods&nbsp;high in unsaturated fat include:\n- oily fish&nbsp;\n- avocados&nbsp;\n- nuts and seeds&nbsp;\n- sunflower&nbsp;oil\n- rapeseed&nbsp;oil\n- olive oil\nRead more about&nbsp;healthy food and diet\nDrinking excessive amounts of alcohol will cause your blood pressure to rise, as well as raising cholesterol levels in your blood. Therefore, sticking to the recommended alcohol consumption limits is the best way to reduce your risk of developing high blood pressure (hypertension) and CKD.\nRegular exercise should help lower your blood pressure and reduce your risk of developing CKD.\nAt least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (such as cycling or fast walking) every week, is recommended.&nbsp;\nRead more about&nbsp;health and fitness\nKidney disease can be caused by the improper use (such as taking too many)&nbsp;of non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), such as aspirin and ibuprofen.\nIf you need to take painkillers,&nbsp;make sure you follow the instructions. This can help to avoid kidney damage.\nComing to terms with a condition such as kidney disease can put a strain on you, your family and your friends. It can be difficult to talk&nbsp;to people about your condition, even if they are close to you.\nLearning about kidney disease often helps because you and your family will understand more about what to expect and feel more in control of the illness, instead of feeling that your lives are now dominated by kidney disease and its treatment.\nBe open about how you feel, and let your family and friends know what they can do to help. However, do not feel shy about telling them that you need some time to yourself, if that is what you need.\nYour GP or nurse can reassure you if you have questions about your kidney disease, or you may find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor, psychologist or specialist telephone helpline operator. Your GP practice will have information on these.\nSome people find it helpful to talk to other people with kidney disease at a local support group or online.\nIf you have to stop work or work part time because of your kidney disease, you may find it hard to cope financially. You may be entitled to one or more of the following types of financial support:\n- if you have a job but cannot work because of your illness, you are entitled to Statutory Sick Pay from your employer\n- if you do not have a job and cannot work because of your illness, you may be entitled to Employment and Support Allowance\n- if you are aged 64 or under and need help with personal care or have walking difficulties, you may be eligible for Disability Living Allowance\n- if you are aged 65 or over, you may be able to get Attendance Allowance\n- if you are caring for someone with kidney disease, you may be entitled to Carer’s Allowance&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n- you may be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home or if you have a low household income\nThe symptoms of kidney disease and the stress it causes in your life can affect your sexual relationships.\nSome couples become closer after a diagnosis of kidney disease, while others find that their loved ones are affected by worries about how they will cope with the effects of the illness. Both men and women may experience issues about body image and self-esteem, and this can affect the relationship.\nTry to share your feelings with your partner. If you have problems with sex that do not get better with time, speak to a counsellor or sex therapist.\nPeople on dialysis often experience specific sexual difficulties. Loss of sex drive in both men and women and impotence in men are commonly reported problems.\nTreatment is available, but&nbsp;it may take some time and requires commitment from both partners. The first step is to discuss it with your healthcare team.\nBoth men and women with early stage kidney disease will find&nbsp;their fertility is unaffected. This means it is important to use contraception unless you want to have a baby.\nLater stage kidney disease may affect&nbsp;women&#8217;s periods, which can make pregnancy more difficult. For men, later stage kidney disease can cause a reduction in sperm count. However, having kidney disease does not mean you will not get pregnant or be able to father a child, so&nbsp;both men and women&nbsp;need to use an effective method of contraception unless they want to have a baby.\nWomen who want to have a baby should talk to their renal specialist or an obstetrician with an interest in kidney disease.&nbsp;Depending on the stage of kidney disease, there can be risks to both the mother and the baby. It is important to minimise any risk with a planned pregnancy. Your healthcare team can advise you about this.\nIf you have mild kidney disease or you’ve had a transplant, going on holiday shouldn’t pose additional health problems, whether you&#8217;re staying in the UK or going abroad.\nIf you’re on dialysis, you can still enjoy holidays provided you book your treatment before you go away.\nIf you&#8217;re on dialysis and want to travel, discuss your plans with your renal unit as early as you can. It can sometimes be more difficult to arrange dialysis in the UK than it is abroad.\nThe NHS will look after you if you get ill while on holiday in the UK. If you’re in Europe, the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) entitles you to free or reduced-cost hospital treatment.\nIt’s a good idea to take out holiday health insurance in addition to carrying the EHIC. Anyone with kidney disease should declare it as a pre-existing medical condition on standard insurance application forms. It may exclude you from some policies.&nbsp;\nSome remedies are potentially harmful for people with kidney disease. Make sure you check with your doctor before taking a new over the counter medicine.\nYou’re at higher risk of being harmed by certain over the counter remedies if:\n- you have advanced kidney disease (stage 4 or 5, or a kidney function below 30% of normal)\n- you have mild-to-moderate kidney disease (stage 3 with a kidney function between 30 and 60% of normal) and are elderly with another serious illness, such as coronary heart disease\nSummarised below is a list of which over the counter remedies are safe for people with kidney disease to use and which should be avoided. This is just a guide. For more detailed information, consult your pharmacist, renal specialist or GP.\nParacetamol is safe and the best choice of painkiller to treat a headache, but avoid soluble products as they are high in sodium. If your kidney function is less than about 50%, avoid painkillers containing aspirin, ibuprofen or similar drugs such as diclofenac. These products can deteriorate the function of damaged kidneys. Low-dose aspirin of 75mg to 150mg a day can be used if it&#8217;s prescribed for the prevention of vascular disease. You should also avoid ibuprofen if you&#8217;re taking anti-rejection treatment following a kidney transplant.\nMany of the products available for coughs and colds contain a mixture of ingredients, so check the packaging carefully. Some products contain paracetamol, which is safe, but others contain high doses of aspirin, which it&#8217;s best to avoid.\nMany cold remedies also contain decongestants, which you should avoid if you have high blood pressure. The best way to clear congestion is by steam inhalation with menthol or eucalyptus. For coughs, try a simple linctus or glycerine honey and lemon to soothe your throat.\nIf you have muscle or joint pain, it&#8217;s ideal to use topical preparations (applied to the skin), which are rubbed on to the painful area. Avoid tablets containing ibuprofen or similar drugs such as diclofenac if your kidney function is below 50%. Ibuprofen gel or spray is safer than ibuprofen tablets, but it isn’t completely risk-free as a small amount of the drug penetrates the skin into the bloodstream.\nAbout 1% of people with stage three CKD develop kidney failure, also called established renal failure (ERF). Kidney failure has a major impact on your life and the lives of those close to you. People diagnosed with kidney failure usually go through shock, grief and denial before they accept their condition.\nIf you have established renal failure (ERF), you will need to decide whether to have treatment with dialysis or a kidney transplant. You may decide to have neither treatment and to have supportive care. These choices should be made with your healthcare team.\nFor people who want active treatment for their ERF, a transplant would be the best option. However, a transplant is only suitable for about half of all people with ERF. This is because they may have had recent cancer or&nbsp;are not physically fit.\nMany people who have slowly progressive kidney failure and other serious health problems, and who are usually older, may choose to avoid dialysis. Supportive care can still allow you to live for some time with a good quality of life.\nA kidney transplant, when suitable, is the best treatment for ERF. The transplanted kidney can be obtained from a deceased or living donor and survival rates are now extremely good. About 90% of transplants still function after five years and many transplants work usefully after 20 years. The main reason people have to wait for a transplant is the shortage of available donors.\nOver a third of kidney transplants are now from live donors. A live donor kidney can be transplanted before the need for dialysis, rather than after a period of time on dialysis.\nOne major risk after transplantation is rejection, where the immune system attacks the donated kidney because it mistakes it for a foreign object. This is prevented with the use of strong drugs to suppress the immune system. These drugs need to be taken meticulously. They are usually well tolerated but may have side effects, including an increased susceptibility to infections and some forms of cancer. For this reason, transplant patients are given regular reviews in a specialist transplant clinic.\nDialysis can take place at home or in hospital. It involves filtering the blood of waste products and excess water. It is not as efficient as a human kidney, so people with kidney failure usually need to restrict their intake of fluid and certain foods. They also require additional medicines such as iron supplements, phosphate binders and antihypertensive medicine (to reduce blood pressure). There are 2 types of dialysis: peritoneal dialysis and haemodialysis.\nThe abdomen (tummy) has a lining called the peritoneal membrane, which can be used as a filter to remove excess waste and water. If you have opted for peritoneal dialysis, a tube (catheter) will be inserted into your abdomen during an operation. This will allow you to drain dialysis fluid in and out of your tummy yourself. You will not need to go into hospital to be treated, but you will have to spend an hour or two each day draining the fluid. The treatment involves either four exchanges spaced out during the day, each taking half an hour, or attaching yourself to a machine overnight that pumps the fluid in and out for you.\nHaemodialysis removes waste products and excess fluid that build up in the body when the kidneys stop working. Blood is taken from the body to be cleaned in a filter known as a dialyser. It is effectively an artificial kidney. The whole process takes about four hours and usually has to be repeated three times a week. Most people go into hospital to have haemodialysis. However, some people choose to have the treatment in their own home.\nHome haemodialysis will give you more flexibility, but comes with greater responsibility. You’ll need to have the space in your home for a dedicated machine and, in most cases, a lot of support from a close family member or friend. Some people choose to have their dialysis at night while they are asleep. Most people who choose home haemodialysis have it every day, so their fluid intake is not as restricted.\nDuring haemodialysis, it is important that large volumes of blood are passed through the machine. This requires special measures to get into large enough blood vessels. For this reason, haemodialysis patients need a minor operation to join one of the deep arteries to a superficial vein (called a fistula). This is carried out in day surgery and should be done at least 6 weeks before dialysis is required because it needs time to mature before it can be used.\nOccasionally, there will be insufficient time for a fistula to be created before dialysis is required. In this case, a temporary solution is found, usually involving the use of an indwelling plastic dialysis catheter. A catheter is a surgical tube inserted into the body to allow for the transfer of fluid.\nAll the issues will be discussed in detail with you by the dialysis team before any decisions are made."

        "disease": "Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia",
        "description": "Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is a type of cancer that affects the white blood cells and tends to progress slowly over many years.\nIt mostly affects people over the age of 60 and is rare in people under 40.&nbsp;Children are almost never affected.\nIn chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL),&nbsp;the spongy material found inside some bones (bone marrow)&nbsp;produces too many white blood cells called lymphocytes that&nbsp;aren&#8217;t fully developed and don&#8217;t work properly.\nOver time this can cause a range of problems, such as an increased risk of picking up infections, persistent tiredness,&nbsp;swollen glands&nbsp;in the neck, armpits or groin, and unusual bleeding or bruising.\nCLL is different&nbsp;from other types of leukaemia, including chronic myeloid leukaemia,&nbsp;acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and acute myeloid leukaemia.\nCLL doesn&#8217;t usually cause any symptoms early on and may only be picked up during a&nbsp;blood test carried out for another reason.\nWhen symptoms develop, they may include:\n- getting infections&nbsp;often\n- anaemia&nbsp;– persistent tiredness, shortness of breath and pale skin\n- bleeding and bruising more easily than normal\n- a high temperature (fever)\n- night sweats\n- swollen glands&nbsp;in your&nbsp;neck, armpits or groin\n- swelling and discomfort in your tummy\n- unintentional weight loss\nYou should speak to your GP if you have any persistent or worrying symptoms. These symptoms can have other causes other than cancer, but it&#8217;s a good idea to get them checked out.\nRead more about&nbsp;diagnosing CLL and complications of CLL.\nAs CLL&nbsp;progresses slowly and often has no symptoms at first, you may not need to be treated immediately.\nIf it&#8217;s caught early on, you&#8217;ll have regular check-ups over the following months or years&nbsp;to see if it&#8217;s getting any worse.\nIf CLL&nbsp;starts to cause symptoms, or isn&#8217;t diagnosed until later on, the main treatments are:\n- chemotherapy&nbsp;– where medication&nbsp;is taken as a tablet or given directly into a vein is used to destroy the cancerous cells\n- a stem cell or bone marrow transplant&nbsp;– where donated cells called stem cells are transplanted into your body so you start to produce healthy white blood cells\nTreatment can&#8217;t&nbsp;usually cure&nbsp;CLL completely, but can slow its progression and lead to&nbsp;periods where there are no symptoms. Treatment may be repeated if the condition comes back.\nRead more about treating CLL.\nThe outlook for CLL depends on how advanced it is when it&#8217;s diagnosed, how old you are when diagnosed, and&nbsp;your general health.\nYounger, healthier people who are diagnosed when&nbsp;CLL is&nbsp;still in the early stages generally have the best outlook.\nAlthough it can&#8217;t normally be cured, treatment can help control the condition for many years.\nIt&#8217;s not clear what causes CLL. There&#8217;s no proven link&nbsp;with radiation or chemical exposure, diet or infections. You can&#8217;t catch it from anyone else or pass it on.\nHowever, having certain genes can increase your chances of developing CLL. You may be at a slightly higher risk of it if you have a close family member with it, although this risk is still small.\nMost cases of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) are detected during blood tests carried out for another reason.\nHowever, you should speak to your GP if you have worrying symptoms of CLL, such as&nbsp;persistent tiredness, unusual bleeding or bruising, unexplained weight loss or night sweats.\nYour GP may:\n- ask about your symptoms and your medical and family history\n- carry out a physical examination to check for problems such as swollen glands and a swollen spleen\n- send off a blood&nbsp;sample for testing\nIf&nbsp;your GP&nbsp;thinks you could have CLL, you&#8217;ll be referred to a hospital doctor called a haematologist, a specialist in blood disorders, for further tests.\nThe main test used to help diagnose CLL is a type of&nbsp;blood test&nbsp;called a full blood count.\nThis is where the number and appearance of the different blood cells in a sample of your blood are checked in a laboratory.\nAn abnormally high number of unusual white blood cells&nbsp;(lymphocytes) can be a sign of&nbsp;CLL. A detailed examination of these cells can usually confirm the diagnosis.\nYou may also have:\n- a chest&nbsp;X-ray\n- an ultrasound&nbsp;of your tummy\n- a&nbsp;computerised tomography (CT) scan\nThese tests can check for problems caused by CLL, such as swollen glands&nbsp;or&nbsp;a swollen&nbsp;spleen,&nbsp;and help&nbsp;rule out other possible causes of your symptoms.\nSometimes&nbsp;the&nbsp;haematologist&nbsp;may&nbsp;recommend removing a sample of your bone marrow&nbsp;(bone marrow biopsy) so they can&nbsp;examine it&nbsp;under a microscope to check it for cancerous cells.\nThe sample is removed&nbsp;using&nbsp;a needle inserted into your hip bone. Local anaesthetic&nbsp;is normally used to&nbsp;numb the area where the needle is inserted, although you may experience some discomfort during the biopsy.\nThe procedure will&nbsp;last around 15 minutes and you shouldn&#8217;t need to stay in hospital overnight. You may&nbsp;have some bruising and discomfort for a few days afterwards.\nIn some cases, removing and examining a swollen lymph gland can help confirm a diagnosis of CLL. This is known as a lymph node biopsy.\nThe gland is removed during a minor operation carried out under either local or&nbsp;general anaesthetic, where you&#8217;re asleep. You won&#8217;t usually need to stay in hospital overnight.\nAfter the operation, you&#8217;ll be left with a small wound that will be closed with stitches.\nTests may also be carried out on your blood and bone marrow samples to check for any unusual genes in the cancerous cells.\nIdentifying unusual genes in these cells can help your doctors decide how soon you should start treatment and which treatment is best for you.\nSome&nbsp;treatments for CLL don&#8217;t work as well in people with certain abnormal genes in the affected cells.\nTreatment for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) largely depends on what stage the condition is at when it&#8217;s diagnosed.\nYou may just need to be monitored at first&nbsp;if it&#8217;s caught early on. Chemotherapy is the main treatment if it&#8217;s more advanced.\nTreatment can often help keep CLL under control for many&nbsp;years.\nIt&nbsp;may go away after treatment initially (known as remission), but will usually come back (relapse) a few months or years later and may need to be treated again.\nDoctors use stages to describe how far CLL has developed and help them determine when it needs to be treated.\nThere are 3 main stages of CLL:\n- stage A –&nbsp;you have enlarged lymph&nbsp;glands in fewer than 3 areas (such as your neck, armpit or groin) and a high white blood cell count\n- stage B –&nbsp;you have enlarged lymph glands in 3 or more areas and a high white blood cell count\n- stage C –&nbsp;you have enlarged lymph&nbsp;glands or an enlarged spleen, a high white blood cell count, and a low red blood cell or platelet count\nStage B and C CLL are usually treated straight away. Stage A generally only needs to be treated if it&#8217;s getting worse quickly or starting to cause symptoms.\nTreatment may not be needed if you don&#8217;t have any symptoms when you&#8217;re diagnosed with CLL.\nThis is because:\n- CLL&nbsp;often develops very slowly and may not cause symptoms for&nbsp;many years\n- there&#8217;s no benefit in starting treatment early\n- treatment can cause significant side effects\nIn these cases, you will normally just need regular visits to your doctor and&nbsp;blood tests&nbsp;to monitor the condition.\nTreatment with chemotherapy will usually only be recommended if you develop symptoms, or tests show that the condition is getting worse.\nMany people with CLL will eventually need to have chemotherapy. This involves taking medication to keep the cancer under control.\nThere are a number of different medicines for CLL, but most people will take 3 main medications in treatment cycles lasting 28 days.\nThese medicines are:\n- fludarabine –&nbsp;usually taken as a tablet&nbsp;for 3 to 5 days at the start of each treatment cycle\n- cyclophosphamide – also&nbsp;usually taken as a tablet&nbsp;for 3 to 5 days at the start of each treatment cycle\n- rituximab – given&nbsp;into a vein over the course of&nbsp;a few hours (intravenous infusion) at the&nbsp;start of each treatment cycle\nFludarabine and cyclophosphamide can usually be taken at home. Rituximab is given in hospital, and sometimes you may need to stay in hospital overnight.\nA number of different medicines can also be tried if you can&#8217;t have these medicines, you&#8217;ve tried them but they didn&#8217;t work, or your CLL has come back after treatment.\nThese include bendamustine, chlorambucil, ibrutinib, idelalisib, obinutuzumab, ofatumumab and prednisolone (a steroid medication).\nThe medicines used to treat CLL can cause some significant side effects, including:\n- persistent tiredness\n- feeling sick\n- an increased risk of infections\n- easy bruising or bleeding\n- anaemia&nbsp;– shortness of breath, weakness and pale skin\n- hair loss&nbsp;or thinning\n- an irregular heartbeat\n- an&nbsp;allergic reaction\nMost side effects will pass once treatment stops. Let your care team know if you experience any side effects, as&nbsp;there are some treatments that can help.\nRead more about the side effects of chemotherapy\nStem cell or bone marrow transplants&nbsp;are sometimes used to try to&nbsp;get rid of CLL completely, or control it for longer periods.\nStem cells&nbsp;are cells produced by the spongy material found in the centre of some bones (bone marrow) that can turn into different types of blood cells, including white blood cells.\nA stem cell transplant involves:\n- having high-dose chemotherapy and&nbsp;radiotherapy to destroy&nbsp;the cancerous cells in your body\n- removing stem cells from the blood or bone marrow&nbsp;of a donor&nbsp;– this will ideally be someone closely related to you, such as a sibling\n- transplanting the donor stem cells directly into one of your veins\nThis&nbsp;is the only potential cure for CLL,&nbsp;but it&#8217;s not done very often&nbsp;as it&#8217;s an intensive treatment and many people with CLL are older and not well enough for the benefits to outweigh the risks.\nThe initial treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy&nbsp;can place a significant strain on your body and cause&nbsp;troublesome side effects.\nThere&#8217;s also a risk of serious problems after the transplant, such as graft versus host disease. This is where&nbsp;the transplanted cells attack the other cells in your body.\nThere are also a number of other treatments that are sometimes used to help treat some of the problems caused by CLL, particularly if you can&#8217;t have chemotherapy or it doesn&#8217;t work.\nThese include:\n- radiotherapy&nbsp;to&nbsp;shrink enlarged lymph glands or a swollen spleen\n- surgery to remove a swollen spleen\n- antibiotics,&nbsp;antifungals and antiviral medications to help reduce your risk of picking up an infection during treatment\n- blood transfusions&nbsp;to provide more red blood cells and&nbsp;platelets (clotting&nbsp;cells)&nbsp;if you experience severe anaemia or problems with bleeding and bruising\n- immunoglobulin replacement therapy&nbsp;– a transfusion of&nbsp;antibodies taken from donated blood that&nbsp;can help prevent infections\n- injections of medication called&nbsp;granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to help boost the number of white blood cells\nYou may also need additional treatment for any complications of CLL that develop.\nAs many of the treatments for CLL can have unpleasant side effects that may affect your quality of life, you may decide against having a particular type of treatment.\nThis is entirely your decision and your treatment team will respect any decision you make.\nYou won&#8217;t be rushed into deciding about your treatment, and before making a decision you can talk to your doctor, partner, family and friends.\nPain relief and nursing care will still be available as and when you need it.\nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) can sometimes cause a number of further complications.\nPeople with CLL usually have a weakened immune system and are more vulnerable to infections&nbsp;because they have a lack of healthy, infection-fighting white blood cells.\nTreatment with&nbsp;chemotherapy can also further weaken the immune system.\nIf you have CLL, it&#8217;s a good idea to:\n- report any possible symptoms of an infection to your GP or care team immediately – things to look out for include a high temperature (fever), aching muscles,&nbsp;diarrhoea or headaches\n- ensure your vaccinations are up-to-date –&nbsp;speak to your GP or care team for advice about any additional vaccines you might need, as some aren&#8217;t safe if you have a weak immune system\n- avoid close contact with anyone who has an infection – even if it&#8217;s an infection to which you were previously immune, such as chickenpox\nYou may also be prescribed regular doses of medications such as antibiotics&nbsp;to help reduce the risk of infection.\nIn up to&nbsp;1 in every 20 people with&nbsp;CLL, the condition will change to become very similar to an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This is called Richter&#8217;s transformation or Richter&#8217;s syndrome.\nSymptoms of Richter&#8217;s syndrome include:\n- sudden swelling of your lymph glands\n- a high temperature (fever)\n- night sweats\n- unintentional weight loss\n- tummy (abdominal) pain\nRichter syndrome is usually treated with a combination of chemotherapy and other powerful medicines.\nThe&nbsp;Cancer Research UK website has more information on Richter&#8217;s syndrome.\nAround&nbsp;1 in every 10 people with CLL will develop a condition called autoimmune haemolytic anaemia.\nThis is where the&nbsp;immune system&nbsp;starts to attack and destroy red blood cells. It can cause severe anaemia, making you feel breathless and easily tired.\nIt&#8217;s usually treated with steroid medication\nBeing diagnosed with CLL can be very distressing and difficult to take in at first, particularly as it can&#8217;t necessarily be cured and you may be advised to wait for it to get worse before starting treatment.\nHaving to wait years to see how the condition develops can also be very stressful and make you feel anxious or&nbsp;depressed. Speak to your GP or care team if you&#8217;re finding it difficult to cope.\nYou may also find it useful to talk to other people who are living with leukaemia. Your GP or care team will&nbsp;be able to provide you with the details of support groups in your area.\nMacmillan Cancer Support&nbsp;provides an excellent level of help and support. Their helpline number is&nbsp;0808 808 00 00, Monday to Friday, 8am to 8pm.\nIt&#8217;s not known what causes most cases of leukaemia. However, there are many risk factors that are known to increase your chances of getting chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.\nRisk factors for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia include:\n- having a family history of the condition\n- being of European, American or Australian origin\n- having certain medical conditions\n- being male&nbsp;\nIn some cases, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia appears to run in families. It&#8217;s thought that an inherited&nbsp;gene mutation (change to a gene) could increase your susceptibility to developing the condition. This means there may be certain genes in your family that make it more likely that you&#8217;ll develop chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.\nMore research is needed, but having a parent or sibling (brother or sister) with&nbsp;chronic lymphocytic leukaemia slightly&nbsp;increases your chances of also developing the condition.\nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia most commonly affects people of European, American and Australian origin.\nIt&#8217;s rare in people from China, Japan and South East Asia, and it affects more white people than black people. It&#8217;s not known why the condition affects people of some ethnic backgrounds and not others.\nResearch has shown that having certain medical conditions slightly increases your chances of developing chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. These conditions include:\n- pneumonia (chest infection)&nbsp;\n- sinusitis&nbsp;\n- shingles&nbsp;\n- autoimmune haemolytic anaemia\n- long-term (chronic) osteoarthritis\n- prostatitis (an inflamed prostate)\nHowever, rather than causing&nbsp;chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, some of these conditions may occur as a result of&nbsp;having lowered immunity during the early stages of the condition.\nHaving a lowered immunity due to having a condition such as HIV or AIDS, or taking immunity lowering medication following an organ transplant can also increase your risk of developing chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.\nExposure to&nbsp;radiation is known to increase the risk of getting other types of leukaemia, but&nbsp;it&#8217;s not been linked specifically to chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.\nThe&nbsp;Cancer Research UK website has more information about the risk factors for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.\nFor reasons that are unclear, men are around twice as likely to develop chronic lymphocytic leukaemia than women. The risk of developing leukaemia also increases as you get older."

        "disease": "Chronic myeloid leukaemia",
        "description": "Leukaemia is cancer of the white blood cells. Chronic leukaemia means the condition progresses slowly over many years. Chronic leukaemia is classified according to the type of white blood cells that are affected by cancer. There are 2 main types:\n- lymphocytes – mostly used to fight viral infections\n- myeloid cells – which perform a number of different functions, such as fighting bacterial infections, defending the body against parasites and preventing the spread of tissue damage\nThese pages focus on chronic myeloid leukaemia, which is a cancer of the myeloid cells. The following other types of leukaemia are covered elsewhere:\n- chronic lymphocytic leukaemia\n- acute myeloid leukaemia\n- acute lymphoblastic leukaemia\nYour bone marrow produces stem cells. These are unique cells because they have the ability to develop into three important types of blood cell:\n- red blood cells – which carry oxygen around the body\n- white blood cells – which help fight infection\n- platelets – which help stop bleeding\nIn leukaemia, a genetic mutation in the stem cells causes a huge over-production of white blood cells and a corresponding drop in red blood cells and platelets.\nIt&#8217;s this lack of red blood cells which causes symptoms of anaemia, such as tiredness, and the lack of platelets that increases the risk of excessive bleeding.\nIn its early stages, chronic myeloid leukaemia usually causes no noticeable symptoms. As the condition develops, symptoms include:\n- tiredness&nbsp;\n- weight loss&nbsp;\n- night sweats\n- a feeling of bloating\n- bruising&nbsp;\n- bone pain&nbsp;\nRead more about the symptoms of chronic myeloid leukaemia\nChronic myeloid leukaemia is quite a rare type of cancer.&nbsp;\nChronic myeloid leukaemia can affect people of any age, but it is more common in people aged 40 to 60. There is no evidence that it runs in families.\nIn its early stages, chronic myeloid leukaemia usually causes no noticeable symptoms and it is often diagnosed during tests for a different condition.\nWhen symptoms do develop, they are similar to those of many other illnesses and can include:\n- tiredness\n- frequent infections\n- unexplained weight loss\n- a feeling of bloating\n- less commonly, swollen lymph nodes – glands found in the neck and under your arms, which are usually painless\nChronic myeloid leukaemia can also cause swelling in your spleen (an organ that helps to filter impurities from your blood). This can cause a lump to appear on the left side of your abdomen, which may be painful when touched. A swollen spleen can also put pressure on your stomach, causing a lack of appetite and indigestion.\nThe symptoms of chronic myeloid leukaemia in its advanced stage will be much more noticeable and troublesome. They include:\n- severe fatigue\n- bone pain\n- night sweats\n- fever\n- easily bruised skin\nChronic myeloid leukaemia is caused by a DNA mutation in the stem cells which produce white blood cells.\nThe change in the DNA causes the&nbsp;stem cells to&nbsp;produce more white blood cells than are needed.\nThey are also released from the bone marrow before they are mature&nbsp;and able to fight infection like healthy &#8216;adult&#8217; white blood cells.\nAs the number of immature cells increases,&nbsp;the number of&nbsp;healthy red blood cells and platelets fall, and it&#8217;s this&nbsp;fall&nbsp;which causes many of the&nbsp;symptoms of chronic leukaemia.\nAlthough the cause of chronic myeloid leukaemia is genetic, it is not inherited as it is an acquired genetic abnormality.\nMost people with the condition have an abnormal chromosome, where a section of DNA from one chromosome&nbsp;has been swapped with a section from another.\nThis is called the&nbsp;Philadelphia chromosome and it makes the cell produce a protein that encourages the leukaemic cells to resist normal cell death and&nbsp;grow and multiply far more quickly than usual.\nWhat triggers the development of chronic leukaemia and causes the initial mutation in stem cells is unknown. The one proven risk factor is exposure to radiation.\nHowever, radiation is only a significant risk if the levels are extremely high, such as those recorded after an atomic bomb explodes, or those released after a nuclear reactor accident, such as the one at Chernobyl.\nThere is limited evidence that prolonged exposure to the chemical benzene leads to an increased risk of chronic myeloid leukaemia. Benzene is found in petrol and is also used in the rubber industry, but in the UK&nbsp;there are strict controls to protect people from prolonged exposure.\nBenzene is also found in cigarettes. However, it is thought that smoking is more of a risk factor in acute leukaemia than it is in chronic leukaemia.\nA number of occupations have been linked to an increased risk of chronic leukaemia, possibly due to exposure to certain substances such as pesticides or chemicals.\nThese occupations include:\n- all types of agricultural workers\n- people who are involved with rubber or plastic manufacture\n- tailors and dressmakers\n- cleaners\n- builder’s labourer\nThere is some evidence to show an increased risk of chronic leukaemia in people who:\n- are obese\n- have a weakened immune system – due to HIV or AIDS or taking immunosuppressants after an organ transplant\n- have inflammatory bowel disease – such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn&#8217;s disease\nChronic myeloid leukaemia is often first detected when a routine blood test is carried out to diagnose another, unrelated, condition.\nA&nbsp;blood test&nbsp;that reveals abnormally high levels of white blood cells could be a sign of chronic leukaemia. If you have a blood test with abnormal results, you will be referred to a haematologist (a specialist in treating blood conditions) for further testing.\nTo confirm a diagnosis of chronic leukaemia, the haematologist will take a small sample of your bone marrow to examine under a microscope. This procedure is known as a bone marrow biopsy. A bone marrow biopsy is usually carried out under a local anaesthetic.\nThe haematologist will numb an area of skin at the back of your hip bone, before using a needle to remove the bone marrow sample.&nbsp;You&nbsp;may experience some pain&nbsp;once the anaesthetic wears off and&nbsp;some bruising and discomfort for a few days afterwards. The procedure takes around 15 minutes to complete and you should not have to stay in hospital overnight.\nThe bone marrow sample will be checked to see if there are cancerous cells. If&nbsp;there are, the biopsy will also be able to help determine which type of chronic leukaemia is present.\nThere are a number of additional tests that can be used to help reveal more information about the progress and extent of the leukaemia. These can also provide an insight into how the leukaemia should be treated.&nbsp;\nCytogenetic testing involves identifying the genetic make-up of the cancerous cells. There are a number of specific genetic variations that can occur during leukaemia and knowing what these variations are can have an important impact on treatment.\nFor example, 90% of people with chronic myeloid leukaemia have the Philadelphia chromosome. People who have this&nbsp;chromosome are known to respond well to a medicine called imatinib.\nA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test&nbsp;can be&nbsp;done on a blood sample. This is an important test to diagnose and monitor the response to treatment.\nThe blood test is repeated every 3 months for at least 2 years after starting treatment, then less often once remission is achieved.\nIn some cases, the hospital may want to perform some imaging tests to help rule out other conditions or confirm a diagnosis. This may be either:\n- an&nbsp;X-ray&nbsp;– usually to examine your chest\n- an&nbsp;ultrasound scan&nbsp;– usually to examine your spleen and liver\nImatinib tablets are usually given as soon as you have been diagnosed with&nbsp;chronic myeloid leukaemia, to slow its progression. These tablets are taken every day for life, and most patients do really well on them.\nThe aim of treatment is to achieve the following:\n- by 3 months, correct the blood count\n- by 12 months, clear the bone marrow of cells containing the Philadelphia chromosome\n- by 18 months, get to a stage where&nbsp;the leukaemia can only be detected by a very sensitive molecular test (molecular remission)\nChemotherapy&nbsp;is usually offered if the cancer reaches an advanced stage.\nA medicine called imatinib is the main treatment recommended for chronic myeloid leukaemia. It is usually given as soon as a diagnosis is made because the medicine is designed to slow the progression of the cancer and to&nbsp;prevent the condition reaching the accelerated or advanced phase.\nImatinib is a type of tyrosine kinase inhibitor. This means it blocks a protein called tyrosine kinase&nbsp;(tyrosine kinase&nbsp;helps to stimulate the growth of cancer cells). This reduces the production of abnormal white blood cells.\nImatinib is taken as a tablet. The side effects of imatinib are usually mild and should improve with time. They include:\n- nausea\n- vomiting\n- swelling in the face and lower legs\n- muscle cramps\n- rash\n- diarrhoea\nIt is estimated that 10&nbsp;to 40% of people who take imatinib become resistant to its effects, so an alternative treatment is required.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has recommended nilotinib for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia that is resistant or intolerant to imatinib. In some cases, nilotinib is recommended&nbsp;as the first treatment.\nNilotinib&nbsp;works in a similar way to imatinib in that it blocks the effects of proteins that help stimulate the growth of cancer cells.\nSide effects of nilotinib can include:\n- vomiting\n- abdominal pain\n- bone and joint pain\n- dry skin\n- loss of appetite\n- hair loss\n- insomnia\n- night sweats\n- dizziness\n- tingling or numbness\nIf the&nbsp;side effects become particularly troublesome, temporarily stopping the treatment usually helps to bring them under control. Treatment can then be resumed, possibly using a lower dose of medication.\nRead about the complications of chronic myeloid leukaemia for more information and advice about being vulnerable to infection and bleeding.\nOnce chronic myeloid leukaemia has progressed to&nbsp;a more advanced stage, chemotherapy is the next treatment.\nChemotherapy tablets are usually used first because they have fewer and milder side effects than chemotherapy injections. Side effects include:\n- tiredness\n- skin rash\n- increased vulnerability to infection\nChemotherapy can weaken your immune system, which helps protect you against infection. This is known as being immunocompromised.\nRead chronic leukaemia complications for more information about this.\nIf your symptoms persist or get worse, chemotherapy injections (intravenous chemotherapy) will need to be used. Intravenous chemotherapy causes more side effects than chemotherapy tablets and they tend to be more severe.\nSide effects include:\n- nausea\n- vomiting\n- tiredness\n- hair loss\n- infertility\nThese side effects should resolve after your treatment has finished, although there is a risk that infertility could be permanent.\nA bone marrow transplant can offer a cure for&nbsp;chronic leukaemia, although it is only suitable and necessary&nbsp;for&nbsp;some patients.\nBefore transplantation can take place, the person receiving the transplant has to have aggressive, high-dose chemotherapy and radiotherapy to destroy any cancerous cells in their body.\nThis can put enormous strain on the body and can cause significant side effects and potential complications. Transplantations have better outcomes if the donor has the same tissue type as the person who is receiving the donation. The best candidate to provide a donation is usually a brother or sister with the same tissue type.\nDue to these issues, transplantations are usually only successful when they are carried out in children and young people, or older people in good health, and there is a suitable brother or sister who can provide a donation.\nIn most cases of chronic leukaemia, the potential risks of transplantation far outweigh any benefit.&nbsp;\nHowever, your specific circumstances may mean that the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks.\nRead more about bone marrow transplants\nBeing immunocompromised (having a weakened immune system) is a possible complication for some patients with chronic leukaemia.\nThere are 2 reasons for this:\n- the lack of healthy white blood cells means your immune system is less able to fight infection\n- many of the medicines used to treat chronic leukaemia&nbsp;can weaken the immune system\nThis means you are more vulnerable to developing an infection, and that any infection you have has an increased potential to cause serious complications.\nYou may be advised to take regular doses of antibiotics to prevent infections from occurring. You should immediately report any possible symptoms of an infection to your GP or&nbsp;care team&nbsp;because prompt treatment may be required to prevent serious complications.\nSymptoms of infection include:\n- high temperature (fever) of 38C (101.4F) or above\n- headache\n- aching muscles\n- diarrhoea\n- tiredness\nAvoid contact with anyone who is known to have an infection, even if it is a type of infection that you were previously immune to, such as chickenpox or measles. This is because your previous immunity to these conditions will probably be suppressed (lowered).\nWhile it is important to go outside on a regular basis, both for exercise and for your psychological wellbeing, avoid visiting crowded places and using public transport during rush hour.\nAlso ensure that all of your&nbsp;vaccinations are up-to-date. Your GP or care team will be able to advise you about this. You will be unable to have any vaccine that contains activated particles of viruses or bacteria, such as:\n- the&nbsp;mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) vaccine\n- the polio vaccine\n- the oral typhoid vaccine\n- the BCG vaccine (used to vaccinate against tuberculosis)\n- the yellow fever vaccine\nReceiving a diagnosis of chronic leukaemia can be very distressing, particularly if it is unlikely that your condition can be cured. At first, the news may be difficult to take in.\nThe situation can be made worse if you are confronted with the knowledge that even though your leukaemia may not currently be causing any symptoms, it could be a serious problem in later life. Having to wait many years to see how the leukaemia develops can be immensely stressful and can trigger feelings of stress, anxiety and depression.\nIf you have been diagnosed with leukaemia, talking to a counsellor or psychiatrist (a doctor who specialises in treating mental health conditions) may help you to combat feelings of depression and anxiety. Antidepressants or medicines that help to reduce feelings of anxiety may also help you cope better with the condition.\nYou may find it useful to talk to other people who are living with leukaemia. Your GP or multidisciplinary team may be able to provide you with details of local support groups.\nAnother excellent resource is Macmillan Cancer Support. Their helpline number is 0808 808 00 00 and is open Monday to Friday, 8am to 8pm.\nYou can read more information from Cancer Research UK about chronic myeloid leukaemia."

        "disease": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)",
        "description": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a collection of lung diseases. It includes chronic bronchitis, emphysema and chronic obstructive airways disease.\nPeople with COPD have difficulties breathing.\nCOPD does not usually become noticeable until after the age of 35. Most people diagnosed with the condition are over 50 years old.\nChest pain and coughing up blood (haemoptysis) are not common symptoms of COPD.\nIt&#8217;s important that COPD is diagnosed as early as possible.\nYour GP may:\n- ask about your symptoms\n- ask whether you smoke, or used to smoke\n- listen to your chest using a stethoscope\n- weigh you to measure your body mass index (BMI)\n- check how well your lungs are working with a breathing test called spirometry\n- want to rule out other conditions with tests like a chest X-ray or blood test\nYou may need more tests to confirm you have COPD or check how severe it is. These tests may include:\n- an electrocardiogram (ECG) or echocardiogram to check the condition of your heart\n- peak flow tests to measure how fast you can breathe out, and rule out asthma\n- a blood oxygen level test using a pulse oximeter (looks like a peg attached to your finger) to see if extra oxygen would help you\n- a blood test to check if you have a genetic tendency to COPD (alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency)\n- a computerised tomography (CT) scan to see any changes to the lung\n- more detailed lung function tests than spirometry (you may be referred to a hospital for these)\n- a phlegm sample to check for infection\nThere is currently no cure for COPD. But the sooner treatment is started, the less chance there is of complications and flare-ups. Damage to your lungs that has already happened cannot be reversed. But you can slow COPD down and feel better with treatment, especially by stopping smoking.\nNHS Scotland recommends you get the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine, flu vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine when offered them.\nTreatments for COPD usually involve relieving the symptoms with medication. For example, by using an inhaler to make breathing easier. Pulmonary rehabilitation may also help increase the amount of exercise you can do.\nSurgery is only an option for a small number of people with COPD and lung transplant for people under 60.\nStopping smoking is the best way for people with COPD to help themselves feel better.\nStopping smoking at an early stage of the disease makes a huge difference. Any damage already done to the airways cannot be reversed. But giving up smoking can slow the rate at which the condition worsens.\nIf an inhaler is prescribed for you, your healthcare professional can explain how to use it.\nWatch Asthma + Lung UK&#8217;s videos on how to use your inhaler\nShort-acting bronchodilator inhalers give a small dose of medicine directly to your lungs. This causes the muscles in your airways to relax and open up.\nThere are 2 types of short-acting bronchodilator inhaler:\n- beta-2 agonist inhalers, such as salbutamol and terbutaline\n- antimuscarinic inhalers, such as ipratropium\nThe inhaler should be used when you feel breathless to relieve the symptoms.\nIf a short-acting bronchodilator inhaler does not help your symptoms, your GP may recommend a long-acting bronchodilator inhaler. This works in a similar way to a short-acting bronchodilator, but each dose lasts for at least 12 hours.\nThere are 2 types of long-acting bronchodilator inhalers:\n- beta-2 agonist inhalers, such as salmeterol, formoterol, vilanterol and indacaterol\n- antimuscarinic inhalers, such as tiotropium, glycopyrronium and aclidinium\nYou&#8217;ll usually be given a combination of these.\nSteroid inhalers, also called corticosteroid inhalers, can help to reduce the frequency of exacerbations or flare ups in some people with COPD.\nThere is no recycling scheme available for used inhalers. You should return all your used or expired inhalers to your community pharmacy for safe disposal. Spacers should be replaced each year if used regularly. Old spacers go into the household bin.\nUsing your preventer inhaler correctly and keeping your symptoms under control is good for your health and the environment. Some inhalers have a lower carbon footprint and are better for the environment than others. The best inhaler is one that works well for you. Speak to your healthcare professional about whether lower global warming potential inhalers would be right for you.\nYou may be prescribed medicines such as:\n- mucolytic tablets or capsules to make your phlegm easier to cough up – these are good for people with lots of thick phlegm or who have frequent or bad flare-ups\n- antibiotics if you have a chest infection\n- steroid tablets if you have a bad flare-up\nOther types of treatment include:\n- nebulised medication (for severe cases where inhalers have not worked) – a large dose of medicine is taken through a mouthpiece or a face mask\n- oxygen therapy (if your oxygen levels are low) – taking oxygen through tubes in your nose or through a mask\n- non-invasive ventilation (NIV) – helps you breathe using a portable machine connected to a mask covering the nose or face\n- pulmonary rehabilitation programmes – exercise and education to help people with chronic lung problems, you can ask your healthcare professional if this is available\nCauses of COPD include:\n- genetics (COPD-G)\n- abnormal lung development, early life events, premature birth, low birth weight, neonatal ventilation (COPD-D)\n- smoking including in utero (from before birth), passive smoking, vaping, cannabis (COPD-C)\n- pollution from outdoor air, wildfire smoke, occupational hazards, household pollution (COPD-P)\n- infections (COPD-I)\n- unknown cause (COPD-U)\nThe main cause of COPD is smoking. The more you smoke, and the longer you&#8217;ve been smoking, the more likely you are to develop COPD. This is because smoking irritates and inflames the lungs, and prevents them functioning normally, which results in scarring. Passive (second-hand) smoke can also cause COPD.\nOver many years, the inflammation leads to permanent changes in the lung. The walls of the airways thicken and more phlegm is produced. Damage to the delicate walls of the air sacs in the lungs causes emphysema and the lungs lose their normal elasticity. The smaller airways also become scarred and narrowed. These changes cause the symptoms of breathlessness, cough and phlegm associated with COPD."

        "disease": "Chronic pancreatitis",
        "description": "Chronic pancreatitis is a condition where the pancreas (a small organ located behind the stomach and below the ribcage) becomes permanently damaged from inflammation.\nIt&#8217;s different to&nbsp;acute pancreatitis, where the inflammation is only short-term.\nThe most common symptom of chronic pancreatitis is repeated episodes of abdominal&nbsp;(tummy) pain, which can be severe.\nOther symptoms tend to develop as the damage to the pancreas progresses, such as producing greasy, foul-smelling stools.\nRead more about the symptoms of chronic pancreatitis and diagnosing chronic pancreatitis.\nAlways visit your GP if you&#8217;re experiencing severe pain – it&#8217;s a warning sign that something is wrong.\nLong-term alcohol misuse is responsible for around 7 out of every 10 cases of chronic pancreatitis. This is because heavy drinking over a number of years can repeatedly damage the pancreas.\nLess common causes include:\n- smoking\n- a problem with the immune system, causing it to attack the pancreas\n- an inherited&nbsp;genetic mutation disrupting the functions of the pancreas\nIn as many as 3 out of 10 people with the condition, the cause cannot be identified – this is known as &#8216;idiopathic&#8217; chronic pancreatitis.\nRead more about the causes of chronic pancreatitis.\nChronic pancreatitis can affect people of any age, but is most common in middle-aged men aged between 45 and 54.\nIn most cases of chronic pancreatitis, there&#8217;s no specific treatment to reduce the inflammation and repair the damage to the pancreas.\nTreatment mainly focuses on lifestyle changes and medication to relieve the pain. Surgery is sometimes needed to treat severe chronic pain that doesn&#8217;t respond to painkillers.\nHowever, the pain can be difficult to treat and can seriously affect your quality of life.\nPeople who don&#8217;t smoke cigarettes and avoid drinking alcohol tend to experience less pain and live longer than those who continue to drink and smoke after receiving a diagnosis.\nRead more about treating chronic pancreatitis.\nLiving with chronic pain can cause mental as well as physical strain. It&#8217;s important to speak to your GP if you&#8217;re experiencing stress, anxiety or depression caused by chronic pancreatitis.\nDiabetes is a common complication of chronic pancreatitis and affects about a third of people with the condition. It occurs when the pancreas is damaged and unable to produce insulin.\nPeople with chronic pancreatitis also have an increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer.\nRead more about the possible complications of chronic pancreatitis.\nThe most common symptom of chronic pancreatitis is repeated episodes of abdominal (tummy) pain. Eventually, there may also be digestion problems.\nThe pain usually develops in the middle or left side of&nbsp;the abdomen and can sometimes travel along your back. It&#8217;s been described as a burning or shooting pain which comes and goes, but can last for several hours or days, in some cases.\nSome people also experience symptoms of&nbsp;nausea and vomiting during the pain. As chronic pancreatitis progresses, the painful episodes may become more frequent and severe.\nAlthough the pain sometimes occurs after eating a meal, there&#8217;s often no trigger.\nEventually, a constant mild to moderate pain can develop in the abdomen in between episodes of severe pain. This is most common in people who continue to drink alcohol after being diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis.\nSome people who&nbsp;stop&nbsp;drinking alcohol and&nbsp;stop smoking&nbsp;may experience a reduction in the severity of their pain.\nAdditional symptoms can occur when the pancreas loses its ability to produce digestive juices, which help to break down food in the digestive system. The pancreas usually only loses these functions many years after the original symptoms started.\nThe absence of digestive juices&nbsp;makes it difficult for your digestive system to break&nbsp;down fats and certain proteins. This can cause your stools to become particularly smelly and greasy, and make them difficult to flush down the toilet.\nYou may also experience:\n- weight loss\n- loss of appetite\n- jaundice&nbsp;(yellowing of the skin and eyes)\n- symptoms of diabetes – such as feeling very thirsty, urinating frequently and feeling very tired\n- ongoing nausea and vomiting\nAlways visit your GP if you&#8217;re experiencing severe pain, as this is a warning sign that something is wrong.\nYou should also visit your GP if you develop symptoms of jaundice. Jaundice can have a range of causes other than pancreatitis, but it&#8217;s usually a sign that there&#8217;s something wrong with your digestive system.\nYou should also visit your GP if you develop persistent vomiting.\nMost cases of chronic pancreatitis are associated with drinking excessive amounts of alcohol over a long period of time.\nHowever, in up to 3 out of 10 people with the condition, the cause can&#8217;t be identified – known as &#8216;idiopathic&#8217; chronic pancreatitis.\nHeavy drinking over many years can cause repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis is usually a short-term condition, but it can recur if you continue to drink alcohol.\nOver time, repeated inflammation causes permanent damage to the pancreas, resulting in chronic pancreatitis.\nAnyone who regularly consumes alcohol has an increased risk of chronic pancreatitis, although only a minority develop the condition.\nRead more about&nbsp;alcohol misuse.\nRare cases of chronic pancreatitis are the result of a problem with the immune system, which causes it to attack the pancreas. This is known as &#8216;autoimmune pancreatitis&#8217; and it&#8217;s not clear exactly why it happens.\nMany people with autoimmune pancreatitis also have other conditions caused by the immune system attacking healthy tissue. These include ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease, both of which cause inflammation inside the digestive system.\nSome cases of chronic pancreatitis are inherited. This is thought to be caused by mutations (alterations) in a number of genes, including genes called PRSS1 and SPINK-1. These mutations disrupt the&nbsp;normal working of the pancreas.\nGenetic mutations may also have a role in the effect of alcohol on your pancreas. Evidence suggests that certain genetic mutations make&nbsp;the pancreas more vulnerable to the harmful effects of alcohol.\nCertain mutations of the CFTR gene, responsible for&nbsp;cystic fibrosis,&nbsp;are also thought to cause chronic pancreatitis in a small amount of cases.\nSeveral other rare causes of chronic pancreatitis have also been identified, including:\n- injury to the pancreas\n- blocked&nbsp;or narrowed&nbsp;openings (ducts)&nbsp;of the pancreas\n- smoking\n- radiotherapy to the&nbsp;abdomen (tummy)\nChronic pancreatitis can usually only be diagnosed by carrying out scans of the pancreas.\nYour GP will ask about your symptoms and may carry out a simple physical examination, but they&#8217;ll refer you for further tests if they suspect chronic pancreatitis.\nThese&nbsp;tests are usually carried out&nbsp;in&nbsp;your local hospital and&nbsp;may include:\n- requesting a stool sample\n- an&nbsp;ultrasound scan – where sound waves are used to build up a picture of the inside of your pancreas\n- a computerised tomography (CT) scan – where a series of X-rays are taken to build up a more detailed, three-dimensional image of the pancreas\n- an endoscopic ultrasonography\n- a magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography or MRCP\nDuring an endoscopic ultrasonography, a thin, flexible telescope (endoscope) is passed through your mouth and towards your stomach. An ultrasound probe attached to the tip of the&nbsp;endoscope is able to get close to the pancreas and take very accurate pictures of it.\nYou&#8217;ll usually be given a sedative to help you relax during the procedure.\nAn MRCP involves injecting you with a substance known as a contrast agent that&nbsp;makes your pancreas and surrounding organs, such as the gallbladder and liver, show up very clearly on a&nbsp;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner.\nAn&nbsp;MRI scanner is a type of imaging system that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to build up a detailed image of the inside of your body.\nAn MRCP is a useful way of checking whether gallstones may be contributing to your symptoms.\nSometimes, the symptoms of chronic pancreatitis can be very similar to pancreatic cancer. Therefore, if you have symptoms such as&nbsp;jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes)&nbsp;and weight loss, a biopsy may be recommended to rule out a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.\nA&nbsp;biopsy involves taking a small sample of cells from the pancreas and sending it to a laboratory, so it can be checked under a microscope for the presence of cancerous cells.\nA biopsy can be taken using a long, thin needle that&#8217;s passed through your abdomen. The needle can be guided towards the tumour using an ultrasound scan or CT scan. Alternatively, a biopsy can be taken during an endoscopic ultrasonography.\nTreatment for chronic pancreatitis aims to help control the condition and reduce any symptoms.\nIf you&#8217;re diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis, some lifestyle changes will be recommended.\nThe most important thing you can do is to stop drinking alcohol, even if&nbsp;it isn&#8217;t the cause of your condition. This helps to&nbsp;prevent further damage to your pancreas and may help to reduce the pain.\nIf you continue to drink alcohol, it&#8217;s likely that you&#8217;ll experience debilitating pain and you&#8217;ll be more likely to die from a complication of chronic pancreatitis.\nSome people with chronic pancreatitis caused by alcohol consumption have a dependency on alcohol and require additional help and support to stop drinking. If this applies to you, talk to your GP about getting help to stop drinking.\nTreatment options for alcohol dependence include:\n- one-to-one&nbsp;counselling\n- self-help groups – such as Alcoholics Anonymous\n- a medication called acamprosate that can help to reduce cravings for alcohol\nRead more about&nbsp;treating alcohol misuse.\nIf you smoke, you should stop. Smoking can speed up the progress of chronic pancreatitis, making it more likely that your pancreas will lose its function.\nIt&#8217;s recommended that you use an anti-smoking treatment, such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or bupropion (a medication used to reduce cravings for cigarettes). People who use these types of treatments have a much greater success rate in permanently stopping smoking than those who try to quit using willpower alone.\nIf you want to give up smoking, it&#8217;s a good idea to start by visiting your GP. They&#8217;ll be able to give you help and advice about quitting and can refer you to an NHS Stop Smoking support service.\nThese services offer the best support for people who want to give up smoking. Studies show you are 4&nbsp;times more likely to give up smoking if you do it through the NHS.&nbsp;\nRead more about&nbsp;stopping smoking.\nAs chronic pancreatitis&nbsp;can affect your ability to digest certain foods, you may need to change your diet.\nYour GP&nbsp;may be able to provide you with appropriate dietary advice, or&nbsp;may refer you to a dietitian, who will draw up a suitable dietary plan.\nA&nbsp;low-fat, high-protein, high-calorie diet with fat-soluble vitamin supplements is usually recommended, but don&#8217;t make changes to your diet without consulting a health professional.\nYou may be given&nbsp;pancreatic enzyme supplements, which is medication containing an artificial version of the enzymes produced by your pancreas. These supplements&nbsp;may help to improve the effectiveness of your digestive system.\nSide effects of&nbsp;pancreatic enzyme supplements can include diarrhoea, constipation, nausea, vomiting and stomach pains.\nTalk to your GP if you&#8217;re experiencing troublesome side effects, as your dosage may need to be adjusted.\nIf you have chronic pancreatitis caused by problems with your immune system, treatment is relatively straightforward. The inflammation affecting the pancreas can usually be relieved using steroid medication (corticosteroids).\nHowever, taking corticosteroids for a long time can cause side effects, such as&nbsp;osteoporosis and weight gain.\nPain relief is an important part of the treatment of chronic pancreatitis. At first,&nbsp;mild&nbsp;painkillers will be used, but more powerful ones will be&nbsp;needed&nbsp;if these don&#8217;t work.\nIn most cases, the first painkiller used is paracetamol or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), such as ibuprofen.\nTaking NSAIDs on a long-term basis can increase your risk of developing stomach ulcers, so you may be prescribed an additional medication called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to protect against this.\nIf NSAIDs or paracetamol prove to be ineffective in controlling your pain, it&#8217;s likely that you&#8217;ll need an opiate-based painkiller, such as codeine or tramadol. Side effects of these types of medication can include constipation, nausea, vomiting and drowsiness.\nThe side effect of constipation can be particularly troublesome if you need to take an opiate-based painkiller on a long-term basis. You may be prescribed a laxative to help relieve your constipation.\nSee the page on treating constipation for more information.\nIf you feel drowsy after taking an opiate-based painkiller, avoid driving and using heavy tools or machines.\nIf you experience an attack of very severe pain, you may need a stronger opiate-based painkiller, such as morphine or pethidine. These have similar side effects to opiate-based painkillers.\nLong-term use of these stronger opiate-based painkillers isn&#8217;t usually recommended, because there&#8217;s a high risk of addiction. Therefore, if you have persistent severe pain, surgery&nbsp;is usually recommended.\nIn some cases, an additional medication called amitriptyline may be recommended. Amitriptyline was originally designed to treat depression, but it can help to relieve pain in some people.\nIf medication isn&#8217;t effective, severe pain can sometimes be temporarily relieved for&nbsp;a few weeks or&nbsp;months using a procedure called&nbsp;a nerve block. This is an injection that blocks the pain signals from the pancreas.\nIf the inflammation of your pancreas suddenly gets worse, you may need a short stay in hospital for treatment.\nThis may involve having fluids delivered directly into a vein, and oxygen supplied through tubes into your nose.\nRead more about treating acute pancreatitis.\nSurgery can be used to treat severe pain in people with chronic pancreatitis. Depending on the exact cause of your pain, there are a variety of surgical techniques that may be used.\nPatients with stones in the opening of their pancreas (the pancreatic duct) may benefit from endoscopic surgery and a treatment called lithotripsy.\nLithotripsy involves using shock waves to break the stone into smaller pieces. An&nbsp;endoscope (a long, thin&nbsp;flexible tube with a light source and a video camera at one end) is then used to pass surgical instruments into the pancreatic duct so the pieces can be removed.\nThis treatment may improve pain to some extent, but the benefit may not be permanent.\nIn cases where specific parts of the pancreas are inflamed and causing severe pain, these parts can be surgically removed. This type of surgery is called a pancreas resection.\nPancreas resection can also be used if endoscopic treatment is ineffective.\nThe&nbsp;technique used&nbsp;for pancreas resection depends on exactly which parts need to be removed. For example, some techniques involve removing the gallbladder, along with parts of the pancreas.\nThe different surgical techniques tend to have the same levels of effectiveness in terms of reducing pain and preserving the function of the pancreas, although&nbsp;some of the more complex techniques have an increased risk of complications, such as infection and internal bleeding. Simpler procedures have a lower risk of complications and usually have faster recovery times.\nDiscuss the pros and cons of the appropriate pancreas resection techniques with your surgical team before making a decision.\nIn the most serious cases of chronic pancreatitis, where the pancreas has been extensively damaged, it may be necessary to remove the entire pancreas. This is known as a total pancreatectomy.\nA total pancreatectomy can be very effective in treating pain. However, you&#8217;ll no longer be able to produce the insulin that&#8217;s needed by your body. To overcome this problem, a relatively new technique called autologous pancreatic islet cell transplantation (APICT) is sometimes used.\nDuring APICT,&nbsp;the islet cells responsible for producing insulin are removed from your pancreas, before your pancreas is surgically removed.\nThe&nbsp;islet cells are mixed with a special solution, which is injected into your liver. If the APICT procedure is successful, the islet cells remain in your liver and begin to produce insulin.\nIn the short term, APICT appears to be effective, but you may need additional insulin treatment in the long term. See guidelines from the&nbsp;National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) about&nbsp;autologous pancreatic islet cell transplantation for more information.\nComplications of chronic pancreatitis are relatively common and usually caused by living with chronic pain or damage to the pancreas.\nAny chronic health condition, particularly one causing recurring or constant pain, can have an adverse effect on your emotional and psychological health.&nbsp;The International&nbsp;Association for the Study of Pain&nbsp;found that up to 94% of people with&nbsp;chronic pancreatitis experience pain.\nOne study of&nbsp;people living with chronic pancreatitis found that one in&nbsp;seven people had some sort of psychological or emotional problem, such as stress,&nbsp;anxiety or depression.\nContact your GP if you&#8217;re experiencing psychological and emotional difficulties. Effective treatments are available&nbsp;to help improve the symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression.\nJoining a support group for people with chronic pancreatitis&nbsp;may also help. Talking to other people with the same condition can often help to reduce feelings of isolation and stress.\nAround a third of people with chronic pancreatitis develop diabetes, usually many years after receiving their diagnosis (it&#8217;s not unusual for 20 years to pass before diabetes occurs).\nDiabetes develops when your pancreas is no longer able to produce insulin (a chemical the body uses to break glucose down into energy). The main symptoms of diabetes are:\n- feeling very thirsty\n- going to the toilet a lot, particularly at night\n- extreme tiredness\n- weight loss and muscle wasting (loss of muscle bulk)\nIf you develop diabetes because of chronic pancreatitis, you&#8217;ll probably need to have regular insulin injections to compensate for the lack of natural insulin in your body.\nAnother common complication of chronic pancreatitis is pseudocysts (sacs of fluid which develop on the surface of your pancreas). They&#8217;re thought to affect around&nbsp;1 in&nbsp;10&nbsp;people with chronic pancreatitis.\nIn many cases, pseudocysts don&#8217;t cause any symptoms and are only detected during a computerised tomography (CT) scan. However, in some people, pseudocysts can cause the following symptoms:\n- bloating\n- indigestion\n- dull abdominal pain\nIf the pseudocysts are small and not causing any symptoms, there may be no need for treatment, because they usually disappear on their own.\nTreatment is usually recommended if you&#8217;re experiencing symptoms or the pseudocysts are larger than 6cm (2.3 inches) in diameter. Larger pseudocysts are at risk of bursting open, which could cause internal bleeding or trigger an infection.\nPseudocysts can be treated by draining the fluid out of the cyst. This can be done by inserting a needle through your skin and into the cyst. Alternatively, an endoscopy&nbsp;may be used. This is where a thin, flexible tube called an endoscope is passed down your throat, and tiny tools are used to drain away the fluid.\nSometimes, pseudocysts are treated by removing part of the pancreas using laparoscopic or &#8216;keyhole&#8217; surgery. This is known as a laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy. See guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) on laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy.\nChronic pancreatitis increases your risk of developing&nbsp;pancreatic cancer. However, the increased risk is relatively small. For example, it&#8217;s estimated that for every 100 people with chronic pancreatitis, only 1&nbsp;or 2&nbsp;will develop pancreatic cancer.\nThe most common initial symptoms of pancreatic cancer are much the same as chronic pancreatitis. They&nbsp;include jaundice, abdominal pain and weight loss."

        "disease": "Cirrhosis",
        "description": "Cirrhosis is scarring of the liver caused by continuous, long-term liver damage.\nScar tissue replaces&nbsp;healthy tissue in the liver and prevents the liver from working properly.\nThe damage caused by cirrhosis can&#8217;t be reversed and can eventually become so extensive that your liver stops functioning. This is called liver failure.\nCirrhosis can be fatal if the liver fails. However, it usually&nbsp;takes&nbsp;years for&nbsp;the condition&nbsp;to reach this stage and treatment can help slow its progression.\nEach year in&nbsp;the UK, around 4,000 people die from cirrhosis and 700 people with the condition need a&nbsp;liver transplant to survive.\nThere are usually few symptoms in the early stages of cirrhosis. However, as your liver loses its ability to function properly, you&#8217;re likely to experience a loss of appetite, nausea and&nbsp;itchy skin.\nIn the later stages, symptoms can include jaundice, vomiting blood, dark, tarry-looking stools, and a build-up of fluid in the legs (oedema) and abdomen (ascites).\nRead more about the symptoms of cirrhosis.\nAs cirrhosis doesn&#8217;t have many obvious symptoms during the early stages, it&#8217;s often picked up during tests for an unrelated illness.\nSee your GP if you have any of the following symptoms:\n- fever and shivering\n- shortness of breath&nbsp;\n- vomiting blood\n- very dark or black, tarry stools (faeces)\n- periods of confusion or drowsiness\nRead more about diagnosing cirrhosis.\nIn&nbsp;the UK, the most common causes of cirrhosis are:\n- drinking too much alcohol (alcohol misuse) over many years\n- being&nbsp;infected with the&nbsp;hepatitis C virus for a long time\n- a&nbsp;condition called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that causes excess fat to build up in the liver\nNASH is on the rise in the UK, due to increasing levels of&nbsp;obesity and reduced physical activity. It&#8217;s likely that it will overtake alcohol and hepatitis C as the most common cause of cirrhosis.\nLess common causes of cirrhosis include&nbsp;hepatitis B infection and inherited liver diseases, such as haemochromatosis.\nRead more about the causes of cirrhosis.\nThere&#8217;s currently no cure for cirrhosis.&nbsp;However, it&#8217;s possible to manage&nbsp;the symptoms&nbsp;and any complications, and slow&nbsp;its progression.\nTreating underlying conditions that may be the cause, such as using anti-viral medication to treat a hepatitis C infection, can also stop cirrhosis getting worse.\nYou may be advised to cut down or stop drinking alcohol, or to lose weight if you&#8217;re overweight.&nbsp;A wide&nbsp;range of alcohol support&nbsp;services are available.\nIn its more advanced stages, the scarring caused by cirrhosis can make your liver stop functioning. In this case, a&nbsp;liver transplant is the only treatment option.\nRead more about treating cirrhosis.\nNot exceeding the recommended limits for alcohol consumption is the best way of preventing alcohol-related cirrhosis.\nHepatitis B and C are infections you can get by having unprotected sex or sharing needles to inject drugs. Using a condom during sex and not injecting drugs will reduce your risk of developing hepatitis B and C.\nA vaccine for&nbsp;hepatitis B is available, but there&#8217;s currently no vaccine for hepatitis C.\nRead more about preventing cirrhosis.\nThere are usually few symptoms during the early stages of cirrhosis. Noticeable problems tend to develop as the liver becomes more damaged.\nIn&nbsp;early stage cirrhosis, the liver is able to function properly despite being damaged. As the condition progresses, symptoms tend to develop when functions of the liver are affected.\nSymptoms of cirrhosis&nbsp;can include:\n- tiredness and weakness\n- loss of appetite\n- weight loss and muscle wasting\n- feeling sick&nbsp;(nausea) and vomiting\n- tenderness or pain around the liver area\n- tiny red lines (blood capillaries) on the skin above waist level\n- very itchy skin\n- yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice)\n- a tendency to bleed and bruise more easily, such as frequent nosebleeds or bleeding gums\n- hair loss\n- fever and shivering attacks\n- swelling in the legs, ankles and feet due to a build-up of fluid (oedema)\n- swelling in your abdomen (tummy), due to a build-up of fluid known as ascites (severe cases&nbsp;can make you look heavily pregnant)\nYou may&nbsp;also notice changes in your personality, problems sleeping (insomnia), memory loss, confusion and difficulty concentrating. This is known as encephalopathy and&nbsp;occurs when toxins affect your brain because your liver is unable to remove them from your body.\nIn the later stages of cirrhosis, you may vomit blood or have tarry, black stools. This is because blood can&#8217;t flow through the liver properly, which causes an increase in blood pressure in the vein that carries blood from the gut to the liver (portal vein).\nThe increase in blood pressure forces blood through smaller, fragile vessels that line your stomach and gullet (varices). These can burst under high blood pressure, leading to internal bleeding, which is visible in vomit and/or stools.\nOver time, the toxins that would normally be removed from the body by a healthy liver can cause multiple organ failure, followed by death.\nYou should see your GP if you have persistent signs and symptoms of cirrhosis.\nSeek immediate medical help if you develop the following symptoms, particularly if you&#8217;ve been previously diagnosed with cirrhosis:\n- fever and shivering attacks\n- shortness of breath&nbsp;\n- vomiting blood&nbsp;\n- very dark or black tarry stools\n- periods of mental confusion or drowsiness\nThere are many different causes of cirrhosis. In the UK, the most common causes are drinking excessive amounts of alcohol and long-term hepatitis C infections.\nIn&nbsp;some cases, no specific cause is identified.\nThe liver breaks down toxins (poisons), such as alcohol, but too much alcohol can scar and damage the liver&#8217;s cells. Men and women who drink more than 14&nbsp;units of alcohol a week are considered to be drinking too much.\nIf you&#8217;re a heavy drinker, your chances of developing cirrhosis are increased. However, it&#8217;s important to realise that cirrhosis of the liver isn&#8217;t just a condition that affects people dependent on alcohol. If you&#8217;re a heavy social drinker, you can also develop cirrhosis.\nAlcohol-related cirrhosis usually develops after 10 or more years of heavy drinking. For unknown reasons, some people are more susceptible to liver cell damage than others. Women who drink heavily are more susceptible to liver damage than men, partly because of their different body size and build.\nPeople who drink excessively and continue to drink heavily develop cirrhosis in 3 separate stages.\nThe first stage of alcohol-related liver disease is known as &#8216;fatty liver&#8217;, which almost all excessive drinkers develop. It&#8217;s a side effect of the liver breaking alcohol down and disappears when you drink less.\nThe second stage of alcohol-related liver disease is alcoholic hepatitis. Around 20% to 30% of people who continue to drink heavily develop alcoholic hepatitis. During this stage, the liver becomes inflamed. If alcoholic hepatitis deteriorates into its most extreme form (liver failure) it can lead to death.\nAbout 10% of heavy drinkers&nbsp;develop cirrhosis, which is the third stage of alcohol-related liver disease.\nThis risk of developing cirrhosis, along with the risk of alcoholic hepatitis, is one of the main reasons the government recommends that men and women should not regularly drink more than 14 units a week. If you do drink as much as 14 units a week, it is advised that you spread your drinking over 3 or more days.\nA unit of alcohol is roughly equivalent to half a pint of normal-strength lager or a single measure (25ml) of spirits. A small glass of wine (125ml) is about 1.5 units.&nbsp;\nRead more about alcohol units.\nYour GP can give you help and advice if you&#8217;re finding it difficult to cut down the amount you drink.&nbsp;\nHepatitis&nbsp;is&nbsp;inflammation&nbsp;of the liver. Left untreated, it can damage the liver over many years, eventually resulting in cirrhosis.\nIn&nbsp;the UK, hepatitis C&nbsp;is&nbsp;the most common form of hepatitis. The hepatitis C&nbsp;virus&nbsp;is usually transmitted through blood-to-blood contact,&nbsp;most commonly by sharing needles used to inject drugs.\nTwo other types of hepatitis infection,&nbsp;hepatitis B and D, can also cause cirrhosis.\nNon-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a severe liver condition that can lead to cirrhosis. As with alcohol-related liver disease, the early stage of NASH is the build-up of excess fat in the liver. This fat is associated with inflammation and scarring, which could lead to cirrhosis.\nNASH can develop in people&nbsp;who are&nbsp;obese, have diabetes, have&nbsp;high levels of fat in the blood (high cholesterol) and high blood pressure. Most people with NASH feel well and aren&#8217;t aware&nbsp;they have a problem until cirrhosis occurs and liver function is affected.\nNASH is on the rise in the UK due to increasing levels of&nbsp;obesity and reduced physical activity. It&#8217;s likely that it will overtake alcohol and hepatitis C as the most common cause of cirrhosis.\nThere are a number of other conditions that can prevent the liver functioning healthily and can lead to cirrhosis. These include:\n- autoimmune&nbsp;liver disease – the immune system usually makes antibodies to attack bacteria and viruses; however, if you have an autoimmune disease, such as autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC),&nbsp;your immune system will make antibodies that attack healthy organs\n- some rare, genetic conditions – such as haemochromatosis (a build-up of iron in the liver and other parts of the body) and Wilson&#8217;s disease (a build-up of copper in the liver and other parts of the body)\n- any condition that causes the bile ducts to become blocked – such as&nbsp;cancer of the bile ducts or pancreatic cancer&nbsp;\n- Budd-Chiari syndrome – caused by blood clots blocking the veins that carry blood from the liver\nLess commonly, the use of certain medications, such as amiodarone and methotrexate, can also cause cirrhosis.\nIf your GP suspects cirrhosis, they&#8217;ll check your medical history and carry out a physical examination to look for signs of chronic liver disease.\nIf your GP suspects your liver is damaged, you&#8217;ll be referred for tests to confirm the diagnosis.\nYou may have a number of different tests.\nBlood tests&nbsp;can measure your liver function and the amount of liver damage. A blood test may be used to measure the levels of the liver enzymes alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transferase (AST) in your blood, as these will be raised if you have inflammation of the liver (hepatitis).\nAn ultrasound scan,&nbsp;transient elastography scan, computerised tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan may be carried out on your liver. A&nbsp;transient elastography scan is similar to an ultrasound scan carried out during pregnancy (it&#8217;s sometimes known as a Fibroscan).\nThese scans can produce detailed images of your liver or check liver stiffness to identify any scarring.\nThe&nbsp;Lab Tests Online UK&nbsp;website has&nbsp;more information about&nbsp;ALT and AST measurements.\nA liver&nbsp;biopsy&nbsp;is where a&nbsp;fine needle is inserted into your body (usually between your ribs) to remove&nbsp;a small sample of liver cells. The sample is sent to a laboratory so it can be examined under a microscope.\nThe biopsy is usually carried out under local anaesthetic, as a day case or with an overnight stay in hospital. The outcome of the biopsy will confirm a diagnosis of cirrhosis and may provide more information about the cause.&nbsp;However, transient elastography is increasingly being used as an alternative to a biopsy in the diagnosis of cirrhosis.\nAn&nbsp;endoscopy is where an endoscope (a thin, long, flexible tube with a light and video camera at the end) is passed down your throat and into your stomach.\nImages of your oesophagus (tube from your throat to your stomach) and stomach are transmitted to an external screen where any varices (swollen vessels),&nbsp;which are a sign of cirrhosis, can be seen.\nThere are several different grading systems for cirrhosis according to how serious it is. One system is the&nbsp;Child-Pugh score which, based on your examination and laboratory tests, grades cirrhosis from A (relatively mild) to C (severe).\nAn alternative&nbsp;system called&nbsp;model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) uses the results of a blood test to help identify&nbsp;people who need an urgent liver transplant.\nCirrhosis can&#8217;t be cured, so treatment aims to manage the symptoms and any complications and stop the condition getting worse.\nIt&#8217;s usually not possible to reverse&nbsp;liver damage that&#8217;s already occurred, although recent research suggests this may eventually be possible in cases where the underlying cause of the liver damage can be successfully treated.\nTreatment is likely to take place at a hospital with a specialist hepatology unit, which treats disorders of the liver, gall bladder and biliary ducts.\nTaking medication to treat&nbsp;the underlying cause of the liver damage&nbsp;and making healthy lifestyle changes can help stop cirrhosis getting worse and reduce your risk of developing further health problems.\nThe medication you need will depend on the specific cause of the damage to your liver.\nFor example, if you have viral&nbsp;hepatitis you may be prescribed anti-viral medications. If you have autoimmune hepatitis you may be given steroid medication (corticosteroids) or medication to suppress your immune system (immunosuppressants).\nThere are a number of things you can do to help yourself stay healthy and reduce your chances of developing further problems if you have cirrhosis, including:\n- completely avoid alcohol, regardless of the cause of your cirrhosis, as&nbsp;alcohol consumption increases the rate at which the condition progresses\n- lose weight&nbsp;if you&#8217;re overweight or obese\n- regular&nbsp;exercise to&nbsp;reduce muscle wasting\n- practise&nbsp;good hygiene to reduce your chances of developing infections\n- speak to your GP about&nbsp;vaccinations you may need, such as the annual flu vaccine or&nbsp;travel vaccines\n- speak to your GP or pharmacist if&nbsp;you&#8217;re taking over-the-counter or prescription medications, as cirrhosis can affect the way your body processes some medicines\nMalnutrition&nbsp;is common in people with cirrhosis, so it&#8217;s important to ensure you have a&nbsp;balanced diet to help you get all the nutrients you need.\nAvoiding salty foods and&nbsp;not adding salt to foods you eat can help&nbsp;reduce your risk of developing swelling in your&nbsp;legs, feet and abdomen (tummy) caused by a build up of fluid. See&nbsp;tips for a lower salt diet for more information.\nThe damage to your liver can also&nbsp;mean it&#8217;s&nbsp;unable to store glycogen,&nbsp;a carbohydrate that provides short-term energy. When this happens, the body uses its own muscle tissue to provide energy between meals, which leads to muscle wasting and weakness. Therefore, you&nbsp;may need extra calories and protein in your diet.\nHealthy snacking between meals can top up your calories and protein.&nbsp;It may also be helpful to eat 3&nbsp;or 4&nbsp;small meals a day, rather than 1&nbsp;or 2&nbsp;large meals.\nA number of treatments can ease the symptoms of cirrhosis, including:\n- a low-sodium (salt) diet or&nbsp;tablets called diuretics&nbsp;to reduce the amount of fluid in your body\n- tablets to reduce high blood pressure in your portal vein (the main vein that transports blood from the gut to the liver) and prevent or treat any infection\n- creams to reduce itching&nbsp;\nIn cases of advanced cirrhosis, complications caused by the condition may&nbsp;need treatment.\nIf you vomit blood or pass blood in your stools, you probably have swollen veins in your oesophagus (the long tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach). These are known as oesophageal varices.\nIn these cases,&nbsp;urgent medical attention is required. This means seeing your GP or going to the&nbsp;accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department of your nearest hospital immediately.\nCertain procedures can help stop the bleeding and reduce the risk of it happening again, such as:\n- banding – an endoscopy is carried out (a thin, flexible tube is passed down your throat) and a small band is placed around the base of the varices to help control the bleeding\n- injection glue therapy – following an endoscopy, a type of medical &#8216;super glue&#8217; is injected into the varices to make the blood clot, which helps to stop the bleeding\n- a Sengstaken tube with a balloon on the end – a special tube is passed down your throat into your stomach and the balloon is inflated; this puts pressure on the varices and helps stop the bleeding and you&#8217;ll be heavily sedated during the procedure\n- a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (TIPSS) – a metal tube called a stent is passed across your liver to join 2 large veins (the portal vein and hepatic vein); this creates a new route for your blood to flow through, therefore relieving the pressure that causes the varices\nYou may also be given a type of medication called a beta-blocker, such as propanolol, to reduce the risk of bleeding or reduce the severity of any bleed that&nbsp;does occur.\nAscites (a build-up of fluid around your stomach area) and peripheral oedema (fluid around your legs and ankles) are common complications of advanced cirrhosis. They&#8217;ll need to be addressed as soon as possible.\nYou may have 20 to 30 litres of free water in your stomach area (abdomen), which can make it difficult for you to eat and breathe properly. The main treatments for ascites and oedema are restricting sodium (salt) in your diet and taking diuretic tablets, such as spironolactone or furosemide.\nIf the&nbsp;fluid around your stomach becomes infected, you may need to be treated with antibiotics. Alternatively, antibiotics may be used on a regular basis&nbsp;to prevent infection in people at high risk.\nIn severe cases of ascites, tubes may be used to drain the fluid from your abdomen. This will usually be repeated every few weeks.\nPeople with cirrhosis can sometimes develop problems with their brain function (encephalopathy). This occurs because the liver isn&#8217;t clearing toxins properly.\nThe main treatment for encephalopathy is lactulose syrup. This acts as a laxative (it helps clear the bowels) and helps the body remove the toxins that build up in the body when the liver is failing. In some cases, other laxatives or an enema may be used.\nCirrhosis can affect the liver&#8217;s ability to make the blood clot (thicken), leaving you at risk of severe bleeding if you cut yourself. Vitamin K and a blood product called plasma can be given in emergencies to treat episodes of bleeding. You&#8217;ll need to apply pressure to any cuts that bleed.\nTherefore,&nbsp;you should seek specialist advice before having medical procedures, including any dental work.\nYour liver may stop functioning if it&#8217;s severely damaged by scarring. In this situation, a liver transplant is the only option. This is a major procedure that involves removing your diseased liver and replacing it with a healthy donor liver.\nHowever, you&#8217;ll probably have to wait a long time for a liver transplant because there are more people waiting for a transplant than there are donors.\nThe NHSBT Organ Donation website has more information about transplants and joining the Organ Donor Register.\nYou can reduce your chances of developing cirrhosis by limiting your alcohol consumption and protecting yourself from a hepatitis infection.\nHeavy alcohol consumption is one of the most common causes of cirrhosis of the liver.&nbsp;One of the best ways to avoid this&nbsp;is to keep within&nbsp;recommended limits.\n- men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week\n- spread your drinking over 3&nbsp;days or more if you drink as much as 14 units a week\nIf you have cirrhosis, you should stop drinking alcohol immediately because it speeds up the rate at which the condition progresses, regardless of the cause.\nRead more about alcohol misuse.\nCirrhosis can be caused by infectious conditions, such as hepatitis B and C. Hepatitis B and C can be caught through having unprotected sex or by sharing needles to inject drugs.\nUsing a condom when having sex will help you avoid the risk of getting hepatitis, as will avoiding injecting drugs.\nAnyone who&#8217;s at risk of getting hepatitis B, such as police officers and social care workers, can be protected by being vaccinated against the condition. However, there&#8217;s currently no vaccine for hepatitis C.\nPeople born in areas of the world where hepatitis B and C are widespread, such as parts of South Asia and Africa, need to be screened for hepatitis, as early treatment can help prevent the onset of cirrhosis."

        "disease": "Clavicle (collar bone) fracture",
        "description": "Your injury may be referred to as a fracture, break or crack. These terms all mean the same thing.\nWhen you have a fracture, it&#8217;s not just the bone that&#8217;s affected. You&#8217;ll also have injured some of the soft tissues around it. Soft tissues include the:\n- muscles\n- ligaments\n- tendons\n- nerves\nA clavicle fracture can take between 6 to 12 weeks to heal.\nIt&#8217;s normal to have aches and discomfort beyond this. It&#8217;s also common for the area to be more sensitive for several months afterwards.\nThere are some things that might affect your recovery.\nSmoking affects all your tissues and slows facture healing times. In some people, it can stop healing altogether.\nStopping smoking as your fracture heals will help to ensure the best recovery.\nGet help to stop smoking.\nSome medical conditions, like diabetes, may slow down the healing process.\nEating a healthy diet and keeping yourself active will help your recovery.\nSome medications can slow down fracture healing. If you have concerns about your medication talk to a healthcare professional.\nAnti-inflammatory medication, like Ibuprofen or Naproxen, have been shown to delay healing.\nIt&#8217;s common for a lump to form around the injured area at your collar bone as the healing takes place. In many cases this will remain after your clavicle has healed. You don&#8217;t need to seek help for this unless there is a&nbsp;change to the lump.\nFollowing your X-ray and diagnosis, your fracture will be managed in a Poly Sling.\nThere are things you can do to help your recovery after a clavicle fracture.\nJust after your injury, you should:\n- wear sling during the day except for exercises and personal hygiene\n- choose whether to wear your sling at night\n- start some exercises for your shoulder\n- avoid lifting your elbow above shoulder height as this may be painful\nBetween 3 to 6 weeks after your injury, you should:\n- try not to use your sling\n- begin normal light activities with your arm and shoulder\n- increase movement\n- avoid heavy lifting\nThe injury should be healed between 6 to 12 weeks but heavy tasks may cause discomfort.\nYou should aim to:\n- resume normal day to day activities but be guided by any pain that you experience &#8211; stop if movements become painful\n- start to lift your arm overhead\n- avoid contact sport until at least 12 weeks after the injury\nIf your&nbsp;collar bone&nbsp;hasn’t improved within 6 weeks of following this advice, it’s a good idea to talk to a healthcare professional about your symptoms.\nIt&#8217;s normal to have swelling near the fracture site. It often spreads down your arm.\nSwelling can sometimes last for months. The amount of swelling can also change depending on:\n- your position\n- your activity\n- the time of day\nIt&#8217;s important that swelling is managed well to help your recovery.\nTo help reduce the swelling you should:\n- keep the other joints in your arm moving normally\n- find a balance between rest and activity\n- Use self massage to reduce swelling – gently use your fingertips to push the fluid towards your shoulder\nIt&#8217;s normal to have bruising after a fracture.\nBruising can be widespread and may appear a long way from your fracture. It can be very purple to start with and may change colour as you recover.\nIt&#8217;s normal to have some discomfort in the areas around your fracture. The areas affected can be:\n- other soft tissues\n- nearby joints\n- areas that have been immobilised\nPain can change from day to day and it doesn’t always depend on what you&#8217;re doing. It&#8217;s common to have pain at rest.\nIt&#8217;s normal to have some pain even when your fracture has healed. Some people also experience discomfort in the fracture site during colder weather.\nYour local pharmacy can give you advice on managing pain after a fracture.\nUse Scotland&#8217;s Service Directory to find your local pharmacy.\nThere are some things you should consider when trying to get back to your normal activities.\nYou should contact your insurance provider before driving. Your injury may affect your insurance.\nOnce you&#8217;re out of your sling, you must be able to safely perform an emergency stop or manoeuvre.\nYou should always be in full control of your vehicle.\nYour return to work will depend on the type of work you do and your employer. It may be possible to discuss a phased return to work or changed duties.\nYou don’t need to see a healthcare professional to return to work.\nKeep doing any activities you&#8217;re able to, and as your pain allows. Gradually increase what you do.\nReduced flexibility and strength may make things more difficult to start with. This will get better as you slowly build up to all your usual activities.\nFrustration or low mood after an injury is normal. As you get back to normal life this should get better.\nLoss of confidence is common after a fracture.\nGet advice about preventing falls.\nYou may be sent a letter inviting you for a scan of your bone density after a fracture.\nIt&#8217;s routine to be assessed for any further risk of fracture, especially if you:\n- are over the age of 50\n- have increased risk factors for fracture\nYou can practice exercises for your injured shoulder.\nYou should aim to do these exercises 4 to 5 times a day.\nStop these movements if they make your symptoms worse, or cause new pain."

        "disease": "Clostridium difficile",
        "description": "Clostridium difficile, also known as C. difficile or C. diff, is a bacterium that can infect the bowel and cause diarrhoea.\nThe infection most commonly affects people who have recently been treated with antibiotics, but can spread easily to others.\nC. difficile&nbsp;infections are unpleasant and can sometimes&nbsp;cause&nbsp;serious bowel problems, but&nbsp;they can usually be treated with another course of antibiotics.\nSymptoms of a C. difficile&nbsp;infection usually develop when you&#8217;re taking antibiotics, or when you&#8217;ve finished taking them within the last few weeks.\nThe most common symptoms are:\n- watery diarrhoea, which can be bloody\n- painful tummy cramps\n- feeling sick\n- signs of dehydration, such as&nbsp;a dry mouth,&nbsp;headaches and peeing less often than normal\n- a high temperature (fever) of above 38C (100.4F)\n- loss of appetite and weight loss\nIn&nbsp;some cases, serious complications can develop, such as damage to the bowel or severe dehydration, which may cause&nbsp;drowsiness, confusion, a rapid heart rate and fainting.\nC. difficile mostly affects people who:\n- have been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (antibiotics that work against&nbsp;several types of bacteria) or several different antibiotics at the same time, or those&nbsp;taking&nbsp;long-term antibiotics\n- have had to stay&nbsp;in a healthcare setting, such as a hospital or care home, for a long time\n- are over 65 years old\n- have&nbsp;certain underlying&nbsp;conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),&nbsp;cancer or&nbsp;kidney disease\n- have a weakened immune system, which can be because of a condition such as&nbsp;diabetes or a side effect of a treatment such as&nbsp;chemotherapy or&nbsp;steroid medication\n- are taking&nbsp;a medication called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to reduce the amount of stomach acid they produce\n- have had surgery on their digestive system\nMany C. difficile infections used to occur in places where many people take antibiotics and are in close contact with each other, such as hospitals and&nbsp;care homes.\nHowever, strict infection control measures have helped to reduce this risk, and an increasing&nbsp;number of C. difficile infections now occur outside these settings.\nVisiting your GP surgery with a possible C. difficile infection&nbsp;can put others at risk, so it&#8217;s best to phone your GP or NHS 111 if you&#8217;re concerned or feel you need advice.\nIf your GP is closed, phone 111.\nDiarrhoea can be caused by a number of conditions and is&nbsp;a common side effect of antibiotics, so having diarrhoea while taking antibiotics doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean you have a&nbsp;C. difficile infection.\nYour GP may suggest sending off a sample of your&nbsp;poo to confirm whether you have C. difficile. A&nbsp;blood test may also be carried out to help determine how severe the infection is, and sometimes you may need tests or scans in hospital to check if your bowel is damaged.\nYour GP will decide whether you need hospital treatment (if you&#8217;re not already in hospital). If&nbsp;the infection is&nbsp;relatively mild, you may be treated at home.\nIf you&#8217;re in hospital, you&nbsp;might be moved to a room of your own during treatment to reduce the risk of the infection spreading to others.\nTreatment for C. difficile can include:\n- stopping&nbsp;the antibiotics thought to be causing the infection, if possible – in mild cases, this may be the only treatment that&#8217;s needed\n- taking a 10 to 14-day course of antibiotics that are known to kill C. difficile bacteria\n- rarely,&nbsp;serious&nbsp;infections may&nbsp;require&nbsp;surgery to remove a damaged section of the bowel\nC. difficile infections&nbsp;usually respond well to treatment, with most people making a full recovery in a week or two. However, the symptoms come back in around 1 in 5 cases and treatment may need to be repeated.\nIf you&#8217;re well enough to be treated at home, the following measures can help&nbsp;relieve your symptoms and prevent the infection spreading.\nYour GP may contact you regularly to make sure you&#8217;re getting better. Phone them if your symptoms return after treatment finishes, as it may need to be repeated.\nC. difficile bacteria are found in the&nbsp;digestive system&nbsp;of about 1 in every 30 healthy adults. The bacteria&nbsp;often live harmlessly because the other bacteria normally found in the bowel keep it under control.\nHowever, some antibiotics can interfere with the balance of bacteria in&nbsp;the bowel, which&nbsp;can cause the C. difficile bacteria to multiply&nbsp;and produce toxins that make the person ill.\nWhen this happens, C. difficile can spread easily to other people because the bacteria are passed out of the body in the person&#8217;s diarrhoea.\nOnce out of the body, the bacteria turn into resistant cells called spores. These can survive for long periods on hands, surfaces (such as toilets), objects and clothing unless they&#8217;re thoroughly cleaned, and can infect someone else if they get into their mouth.\nSomeone with a C. difficile infection is generally considered to be infectious until at least 48 hours after their symptoms have cleared up.\nC.&nbsp;difficile&nbsp;infections can&nbsp;be passed on&nbsp;very easily. You can reduce your risk of picking it up or spreading it by practising good hygiene, both at home&nbsp;and in healthcare settings.\nThe following measures can help:\n- stay at home until at least 48 hours after your symptoms have cleared up\n- wash your hands regularly with soap and water, particularly after going to the toilet&nbsp;and before eating&nbsp;– use liquid rather than bar soap and don&#8217;t use flannels or nail brushes\n- clean contaminated surfaces&nbsp;–&nbsp;such as the toilet, flush handle, light switches and door handles&nbsp;–&nbsp;with a bleach-based cleaner after each use\n- don&#8217;t share towels and flannels\n- wash contaminated clothes and sheets separately from other washing at the highest possible temperature\n- when visiting someone in hospital,&nbsp;observe any&nbsp;visiting guidelines, avoid taking any children under the age of 12, and wash your hands with liquid soap and water when entering and leaving ward areas –&nbsp;don&#8217;t rely on alcohol hand gels, as they&#8217;re not effective against C. difficile\n- avoid visiting hospital&nbsp;if you&#8217;re feeling unwell or have recently had diarrhoea"

        "disease": "Coeliac disease",
        "description": "Coeliac disease is a common autoimmune condition where the immune system in a person’s intestine (gut) reacts when they eat gluten. This causes chronic inflammation.\nGluten is a protein found in wheat, barley and rye.\nGluten is found in food and drink that contains wheat, barley and rye, such as:\n- most types of bread\n- pasta\n- cakes\n- biscuits\n- crackers\n- many breakfast cereals\n- pastry\n- certain types of sauces\n- some types of ready meals\n- most beers and lagers\n- certain fruit squashes\nCoeliac disease affects 1 person in every 100. Only about one third of them are ever diagnosed.\nCoeliac disease can be diagnosed at any age.\nReported cases of coeliac disease are twice as high in women than men.\nCoeliac disease can cause a wide range of symptoms in the digestive system and rest of the body.\nSymptoms can develop at any age, but coeliac disease is most commonly diagnosed between the ages of 40 and 60 years.\nMore about the symptoms of coeliac disease or what is coeliac disease?\nCoeliac disease is more common in people with certain conditions and in relatives of people with coeliac disease. It&#8217;s unknown exactly why people develop the condition.\nMore about the causes of coeliac disease\nMost people with coeliac disease have antibodies in their blood. The first stage in diagnosis is a simple blood test. The second stage might result in a biopsy, if necessary.\nMore about how coeliac disease is diagnosed\nCoeliac disease can be effectively treated with a gluten-free diet. By adopting a gluten-free diet and lifestyle, you can manage your condition and improve your quality of life.\nMore about how coeliac disease is treated\nIf coeliac disease isn&#8217;t treated, you&#8217;re at greater risk of conditions like osteoporosis and cancer in later life.\nMore about the complications of coeliac disease\nLiving with coeliac disease can be challenging but with the right support and information, it&#8217;s completely manageable.\nSymptoms of coeliac disease vary from person to person and can range from mild to severe.\nSome people may have no symptoms at all.\nSometimes the symptoms of coeliac disease are mistaken for:\n- irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\n- wheat intolerance\n- stress\n- just getting older\nSome common symptoms of coeliac disease include:\n- severe diarrhoea, excessive wind and/or constipation\n- persistent or unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting\n- recurrent stomach pain, cramping or bloating\n- iron, vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency\n- anaemia\n- tiredness\n- sudden or unexpected weight loss (but not in all cases)\n- mouth ulcers\n- skin rash (dermatitis herpetiformis)\n- depression\n- repeated miscarriages\n- neurological (nerve) problems such as ataxia (loss of coordination, poor balance) and peripheral neuropathy (numbness and tingling in the hands and feet)\nIf you&#8217;ve any of these symptoms, speak to your GP. You must continue eating gluten as part of your diet until you&#8217;ve been diagnosed.\nYou can also take Coeliac UK&#8217;s&nbsp;online assessment.\nChildren with coeliac disease might also not grow at the expected rate, or be late to reach puberty.\nIt&#8217;s not known exactly why people develop coeliac disease or why some have mild symptoms while others have severe symptoms. It could be that a person&#8217;s genetics and the environment play a part in why this condition develops.\nCoeliac disease is more common in people with certain conditions – such as type 1 diabetes, Down&#8217;s syndrome or autoimmune thyroid disease. Also, in close family members (parents or siblings) of people with coeliac disease.\nCoeliac disease often runs in families. If you&#8217;ve a close relative with the condition – such as a parent or sibling – your chance of developing it is higher.\nThis risk is approximately 10% for those with a family history, compared with 1% for someone without a close relative with the condition. If you have a close relative with coeliac disease and you have symptoms you should speak to your GP.\nIf you&#8217;ve an identical twin with coeliac disease, there&#8217;s an 85% chance you&#8217;ll also develop the condition.\nCoeliac disease can be diagnosed at any age, and both children and adults can show symptoms\nDelayed diagnosis is common. It can take an average of 13 years to diagnose.\nMost people with coeliac disease have antibodies that show up in their blood. The first stage in diagnosis can be a blood test.\nA blood test should be offered if you&#8217;ve any of the following:\n- type 1 diabetes\n- autoimmune thyroid disease\n- dermatitis herpetiformis\n- irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\n- anaemia without an obvious cause\n- certain symptoms related to your digestive system – such as frequent diarrhoea, abdominal pain or vomiting, nausea or sudden weight loss\n- close relatives (parents, siblings or children) with coeliac disease\nA blood test might also be offered if:\n- you feel tired all the time\n- a child is not growing as fast as expected\n- you&#8217;ve other symptoms or conditions that sometimes occur in people with coeliac disease – such as mouth ulcers, particular types of problems with your bones or liver, Down&#8217;s syndrome, Turner syndrome or persistent constipation\nBlood tests for coeliac disease are not recommended for infants who&#8217;ve not started to eat foods containing gluten.\nBefore a blood test is taken, it&#8217;s important that you eat gluten-containing foods in more than one meal every day for at least 6 weeks before the test.\nRemember to eat a normal gluten diet for 6 weeks before any tests. This means eating more than one meal a day that includes gluten-based foods.\nA blood test for coeliac disease involves taking a blood sample and testing it for antibodies in the blood.\nYou must have been eating gluten-containing food in more than 1 meal for at least 6 weeks before the test, for it to be successful.\nBlood tests are 95% accurate at diagnosing coeliac disease.\nIf the coeliac antibodies are found in your blood, further investigation will be needed. This&#8217;ll be discussed with you.\nYour GP will refer you to your local coeliac service for confirmation of the diagnosis. You should remain on a normal diet until all investigations are complete.\nIt&#8217;s sometimes possible to have coeliac disease and not have antibodies in your blood.\nIf you continue to have coeliac disease-like symptoms your GP may still refer you for a biopsy of your gut.\nA biopsy can help confirm a diagnosis of coeliac disease.\nIf you&#8217;re referred for a biopsy, this will be carried out in hospital. Usually, a biopsy will be done by a gastroenterologist. This is a doctor who specialises in treating conditions of the stomach and intestines.\nIf you need to have a biopsy, a thin flexible tube with a light called an endoscope will be inserted into your mouth or nose and passed down to your small intestine.\nBefore the procedure, a local anaesthetic is given to numb the throat and/or a sedative to help you relax.\nDuring the procedure, the endoscopist will pass a tiny biopsy tool through the endoscope to take samples of the lining of your small intestine. The sample will then be examined under a microscope for signs of coeliac disease.\nFor those under 16 years the endoscopy would be under an anaesthetic.\nYou should continue to eat gluten-containing foods every day until a diagnosis has been confirmed.\nA biopsy will only show coeliac disease if the person being tested has been eating gluten-containing foods regularly.\nOnly after coeliac disease is confirmed can you start a gluten-free diet.\nIf you&#8217;re already on a gluten-free diet and find it hard to eat gluten again, your GP should refer you to a specialist. You may not be able to get gluten-free foods on prescription if you do not have coeliac disease confirmed by a biopsy.\nRead further information:\n- Diet advice when being tested for Coeliac Disease\n- NICE guidelines &#8211; coeliac disease recognition, assessment and management\n- Lynsey&#8217;s diagnosis story\nIf you&#8217;ve been diagnosed with coeliac disease, you may also have other tests to assess how the condition has affected you so far.\nYou may have further blood tests to check levels of iron and other vitamins and minerals in your blood. This&#8217;ll help check for anaemia.\nIn coeliac disease, a lack of nutrients caused by poor absorption can make bones weak and brittle (osteoporosis).\nA DEXA scan is a type of very low dose X-ray that measures bone density. This may be required if your risk score (FRAX/Qfracture) is high. This will be calculated as part of your assessment.\nYou can buy over-the-counter tests for coeliac disease at pharmacies. There isn&#8217;t enough evidence that these tests are reliable.\nIf you&#8217;ve used one, it&#8217;s important that you talk to your GP about the result.\nBefore a diagnosis can be confirmed, you&#8217;ll still need to have a blood test and biopsy.\nThe only treatment for confirmed coeliac disease is a lifelong gluten-free diet.\nFollowing a gluten-free diet helps prevent gluten damaging the lining of the intestines (gut). This will improve or remove the symptoms.\nA gluten-free diet will also help to prevent the complications later in life.\nIf you&#8217;re diagnosed with coeliac disease and continue to eat foods that contain gluten, your symptoms will return and could cause long-term damage to your health.\nIf you&#8217;ve a confirmed diagnosis of coeliac disease or dermatitis herpetiformis, you can access gluten-free foods on prescription through your GP or Scottish Gluten-free Food Service.\nHow to register with the Scottish Gluten-free Food Service​\nSymptoms should improve within weeks of starting a gluten-free diet. However, it may take up to 2 years for the digestive system to heal completely.\nAfter a confirmed diagnosis of coeliac disease, you&#8217;ll be seen by a dietitian&nbsp;for help with adjusting to your new gluten-free diet and lifestyle.\nThe dietitian will help by:\n- making sure the diet is balanced and contains all the nutrients you need\n- advising how to adjust your diet and lifestyle to ensure it&#8217;s gluten-free\nThe dietitian should provide you with:\n- guidance on gluten-free food alternatives\n- information on shopping, preparing, cooking and storing gluten-free foods\n- information about gluten-free prescriptions and the Scottish Gluten-free Food Service\n- details of local and national support groups\nMore about a dietitian&#8217;s perspective\nAs well as adopting a gluten-free diet and lifestyle, your GP or dietitian might also recommend that you take vitamin and mineral supplements for at least the first 6 months after diagnosis. This will ensure that the you get all the nutrients you need while your digestive system repairs itself.\nTaking supplements can also help correct any deficiencies, such as anaemia (a lack of iron in the blood).\nIf you&#8217;ve coeliac disease, you shouldn&#8217;t introduce gluten into your baby’s diet before it&#8217;s 6 months old. Breast milk is naturally gluten-free and all infant milk formulas are too.\nFoods with gluten should be introduced slowly when a child is around 6 months old. The situation should be carefully monitored.\nIf you have coeliac disease, you should get vaccinations for:\n- pneumococcus\n- flu (annually)\nYou should discuss this with your GP or specialist before having any vaccinations.\nAfter starting treatment, you&#8217;ll need to have an annual coeliac disease health check to monitor your condition. This will be done by your GP, a dietitian or a pharmacist.\nAt this health check, they&#8217;ll ask you:\n- about your health in relation to coeliac disease\n- how you&#8217;re managing your gluten-free diet\nYou&#8217;ll also be given the chance to discuss any concerns. Living with coeliac disease can be challenging but with the right support and information, it&#8217;s completely manageable.\nMore about living well with coeliac disease\nComplications of coeliac disease only tend to affect people that continue to eat gluten, or in people that have taken a long time to diagnose.\nPossible complications of coeliac disease include:\n- lactose intolerance\n- nutritional deficiencies\n- osteoporosis\n- cancer\nIf you&#8217;ve coeliac disease, you may also develop lactose intolerance because the body lacks the enzyme to digest milk sugar (lactose) found in dairy products.\nLactose intolerance is only temporary. It normally disappears when you follow a gluten-free diet.\nMore about lactose intolerance\nSevere symptoms of coeliac disease can lead to malnutrition. However, this is rare.\nMore common is malabsorption where your body fails to absorb nutrients from the foods you eat. This can lead to anaemia if the body doesn&#8217;t take in enough iron, and osteoporosis if there&#8217;s not enough calcium and vitamin D being taken in.\nMore about nutritional deficiencies\nOsteoporosis causes the bones to become brittle, weak and fracture more easily. Bones need a wide variety of vitamins and minerals to stay dense and strong.\nIf you&#8217;ve coeliac disease, you&#8217;ve an increased risk of developing osteoporosis due to the damaged gut failing to absorb key bone nutrients from food. This decreases blood vitamin and mineral levels and the body compensates for this by taking nutrients like calcium from the bones. This weakens your bones and puts you at increased risk of fracture.\nIf you have coeliac disease, you should make sure you&#8217;re eating enough calcium and take vitamin D supplements.\nRead further information:\n- NHS inform: Vitamin D\n- NHS inform: osteoporosis\nHaving undiagnosed or untreated coeliac disease can increase your risk of developing lymphoma and some types of bowel cancer but these are rare. Risks are reduced by following a gluten-free diet.\nLess common complications of coeliac disease include low birth weight in newborn babies and in rare cases, hyposplenia."

        "disease": "Cold sore",
        "description": "Cold sores are small blisters that develop on the lips or around the mouth. They&#8217;re caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) and usually clear up without treatment within 7 to 10 days.\nYou may not have any symptoms when you first become infected with HSV (the primary infection).\nAn outbreak of cold sores may occur later and keep coming back (recurrent infection).\nHowever, if the primary infection does cause symptoms, they can be quite severe.\nSymptoms of the primary infection are most likely to develop in children younger than 5 years old. These include:\n- swollen and irritated gums with small, painful sores in and around the mouth – this is known as herpes simplex gingivostomatitis\n- sore throat and swollen glands\n- producing more saliva than normal\n- high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above\n- dehydration\n- feeling sick (nausea)\n- headaches\nHerpes simplex gingivostomatitis usually affects young children, but adults can also develop it. It can last 7 to 14 days, with the sores taking up to 3 weeks to heal. However, gingivostomatitis doesn’t usually happen after the primary infection.\nSymptoms of the primary infection are rare in adults but are similar to those experienced by children.\nYou’ll usually have a sore throat with or without swollen glands. You may also have bad breath (halitosis) and painful sores in and around your mouth. These can develop into ulcers with grey or yellow centres.\nIf you develop HSV at an early age, it may be triggered periodically in later life and can cause recurring bouts of cold sores. After the primary infection, the symptoms are usually reduced to just the cold sores themselves.\nIf you have cold sores you can get advice and treatment directly from a pharmacy.\nYour pharmacist may recommend that you speak to your GP if required.\nIf you get cold sores, a pharmacist may recommend:\n- creams to ease pain and irritation\n- antiviral creams to speed up the healing time\n- cold sore patches to protect the skin while it heals\nYou can buy electronic devices from pharmacies that treat cold sores with light or lasers. Some people find these helpful, but there have not been many studies to confirm if they work.\nIf you regularly get cold sores, use antiviral creams as soon as you recognise the early tingling feeling. They do not always work after blisters appear.\nIf your cold sores are very large, painful and keep coming back, your GP may prescribe antiviral tablets.\nNewborn babies, pregnant women and people with a weakened immune system who have cold sores may be referred to hospital for advice or treatment.\nCold sores are usually caused by the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1).\nIn most cases, the virus is passed on in early childhood. For example, when a child is kissed by a family member or friend with a cold sore.\nThe virus passes through the skin and travels up the nerves, where it lies inactive (dormant) until it’s triggered at a later date.\nThings that can trigger a cold sore outbreak include:\n- having another infection, such as a respiratory tract infection\n- having a high temperature (fever)\n- emotional upset or psychological stress\n- tiredness and fatigue\n- an injury to the affected area\n- menstruation (periods)\n- strong sunlight\nHowever, in many cases, there’s no obvious trigger for an outbreak.\nSometimes, cold sores can be caused by the herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2).\nThis can happen after having oral sex with someone who has genital herpes, which is usually caused by HSV-2.\nIn genital herpes, painful blisters develop on your genitals and the surrounding area.\nIt’s not possible to prevent infection with the herpes simplex virus or prevent outbreaks of cold sores. However, there are things you can do to minimise the spread of infection.\nCold sores are at their most contagious when they burst (rupture), but remain contagious until they’re completely healed. Avoid close contact with others until your cold sore has completely healed and disappeared.\nHowever, there’s no need to stay away from work or miss school if you or your child have a cold sore.\nCold sores are usually mild, but may cause complications in rare cases. People with weak immune systems caused by illness or treatments such as chemotherapy are particularly at risk of complications.\nDehydration sometimes occurs if drinking fluids becomes painful. Young children are particularly at risk of becoming dehydrated.\nOther complications of cold sores include:\n- skin infections – these often happen if the virus comes into contact with broken skin, such as a cut or graze, or a skin condition such as eczema\n- herpetic whitlow (whitlow finger) – this causes painful sores and blisters to appear on and around your fingers\n- herpetic keratoconjunctivitis – this causes swelling and irritation (inflammation) of your eye area and sores to develop on your eyelids"

        "disease": "Coma",
        "description": "A coma is a state of unconsciousness where a person is unresponsive and cannot be woken.\nIt can result from injury to the brain, such as a&nbsp;severe head injury&nbsp;or&nbsp;stroke. A coma can also be caused by severe alcohol poisoning&nbsp;or a brain infection (encephalitis).\nPeople with&nbsp;diabetes&nbsp;could fall into a coma if their blood glucose levels suddenly became very low&nbsp;(hypoglycaemia)&nbsp;or very high&nbsp;(hyperglycaemia).&nbsp;\nSomeone who is in a coma is unconscious and has minimal brain activity. They&#8217;re alive, but&nbsp;can&#8217;t be woken up and show no signs of being aware.\nThe person&#8217;s eyes will be closed and&nbsp;they&#8217;ll&nbsp;appear to be unresponsive to their environment. They won&#8217;t&nbsp;normally respond to sound or pain, or be able to communicate or move voluntarily.\nSomeone in a coma will also have very reduced basic reflexes such as coughing and swallowing. They may be able to breathe on their own, although some people require a machine to help them breathe.\nOver time, the person may start to gradually regain consciousness and become more aware. Some people will wake up after a few weeks, while others may go into a vegetative state or minimally conscious state.\nDoctors assess a person&#8217;s level of consciousness using a tool called the&nbsp;Glasgow Coma Scale. This level is monitored constantly for signs of improvement or deterioration. The Glasgow Coma Scale assesses three things:\n- eye opening – a score of one means no eye opening, and&nbsp;four means opens eyes spontaneously\n- verbal response to a command – a score of one&nbsp;means no response, and&nbsp;five means alert and talking\n- voluntary movements in response to a command – a score of one means no response, and six means obeys commands\nMost people in a coma will have a total score of&nbsp;eight or less.&nbsp;A lower score means someone may have experienced more severe brain damage and could be less likely to recover.\nIn the short term, a person in a coma will normally be looked after&nbsp;in an intensive care unit (ICU). Treatment involves ensuring their condition is stable and their body functions, such as breathing and blood pressure, are supported while the underlying cause is treated.\nIn the longer term, healthcare staff will give supportive treatment on a hospital ward. This can involve providing nutrition, trying to prevent infections, moving the person regularly so they don&#8217;t develop bedsores, and gently exercising their joints to&nbsp;stop them&nbsp;becoming tight.\nThe experience of being in a coma differs from person to person. Some people feel they can remember events that happened around them while they&nbsp;were in a coma, while others don&#8217;t.\nSome people have reported feeling enormous reassurance from the presence of a loved one when coming out of a coma.\nWhen visiting a friend or loved one in a coma, you may find the advice below helpful:\n- when you arrive, announce who you are\n- talk to them about your day as you normally would&nbsp;–&nbsp;be aware that everything you say in front of them might be heard\n- show them your love and support&nbsp;– even just sitting and holding their hand or stroking their skin can be&nbsp;a great comfort\nResearch has also suggested that&nbsp;stimulating the main senses – touch, hearing, vision and smell&nbsp;– could potentially help&nbsp;a person&nbsp;recover from a coma.\nAs well as talking to the person and holding their hand, you might want to try playing them their favourite music through headphones, putting flowers in their room or spraying a favourite perfume.\nA coma usually only lasts a few weeks, during which time the person may start to gradually wake up and gain consciousness, or progress into a different state of unconsciousness called a vegetative state or minimally conscious state.\n- a vegetative state – where a person is awake but shows no signs of being aware of their surroundings or themselves\n- a minimally conscious state – where a person has limited awareness that comes and goes\nSome people may recover from these states gradually, while others may not improve for years, if at all.&nbsp;\nPeople who do wake up from&nbsp;a coma usually come round gradually. They may be very agitated and confused to begin with.\nSome people will make a full recovery and be completely unaffected by the coma. Others&nbsp;will have disabilities caused by the damage to their brain. They may need&nbsp;physiotherapy,&nbsp;occupational therapy&nbsp;and psychological assessment and support during a period of rehabilitation, and may need care for the rest of their lives.\nThe&nbsp;chances of someone recovering from a coma largely depend on the severity and&nbsp;cause of their brain injury, their age and how long they&#8217;ve been in&nbsp;a coma. But it&#8217;s impossible to accurately predict whether the person&nbsp;will eventually recover,&nbsp;how long the coma will last and whether they&#8217;ll have any long-term problems.\nFor further information and support from healthcare professionals and the families of people in a coma, you may find the following&nbsp;websites helpful:\n- Brain and Spine Foundation\n- Headway: the brain injury association\n- ICUsteps: the intensive care patient support charity"

        "description": "A cold is a very common mild viral infection. You can often treat a cold without seeing a GP. You should begin to feel better in about 1 to 2 weeks.\nThere is a separate page on if your child has cold or flu symptoms.\nThe main symptoms of a cold include:\n- a sore throat\n- a blocked or runny nose\n- sneezing\n- a cough\n- a hoarse voice\n- generally feeling unwell\nLess common symptoms of a cold include:\n- high temperature (fever) – this is usually about 37°C to 39°C (98.6°F to 102.2°F)\n- a headache\n- earache – severe earache may be a sign of a middle ear infection\n- muscle aches\n- loss of taste and smell\n- mild irritation of your eyes\n- a feeling of pressure in your ears and face\nIf your GP is closed, phone 111.\nSpeak to a pharmacist if you have a cold and would like advice and treatment.\nFind your local pharmacy\nThere’s no cure for a cold, but there are things you can do to look after yourself at home. You should begin to feel better in about 1 to 2 weeks.\nAlways read the leaflet that comes with your medicine before taking it. Follow the recommended dosage instructions. If you’re not sure which treatments are suitable for you or your child, speak to a pharmacist for advice.\nBe careful not to use cough and cold medicines if you&#8217;re taking paracetamol and ibuprofen tablets. Cough and cold medicines often also contain paracetamol and ibuprofen so it can be easy to take more than the recommended dose.\nA person can start spreading a cold from a few days before their symptoms start until their symptoms have gone.\nYou can catch the virus from an infectious person by:\n- touching an object or surface contaminated by infected droplets and then touching your mouth, nose or eyes\n- touching the skin of someone who has the infected droplets on their skin and then touching your mouth, nose or eyes\n- breathing in tiny droplets of fluid that contain the cold virus – these are launched into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes\nDifferent viruses can cause a cold. It’s possible to have different colds one after the other, as each one may be caused by a different virus.\nIt can sometimes be difficult to tell if you have a cold or flu, as the symptoms can be similar. The main differences are that flu symptoms:\n- come on quickly\n- usually include a headache, high temperature (fever) and sore muscles\n- make you feel too unwell to continue your usual activities\nCold symptoms:\n- come on slowly\n- mainly affect your nose and throat\n- are fairly mild, so you can still get around and are usually well enough to go to work\n\nColds usually clear up without causing any further problems.

        "disease": "Concussion",
        "description": "Concussion is a type of brain injury. It sometimes happens after a head injury, or a forceful knock to the body. It can happen even if you&#8217;ve stayed conscious (awake) after the injury. Only 10% of concussions involve someone being knocked out.\nThe most common causes of concussion are falls and violence. They also often happen when someone is playing sport. If you think someone may have a concussion, they should stop doing any sport immediately. Remember, if in doubt, sit them out.\nRead more about minor or severe head injuries\nIt can take up to 72 hours after an injury for symptoms of concussion to appear.\nIf someone has a concussion, you may see changes to the way they behave and act. They may:\n- lose consciousness\n- be confused\n- have a blank expression\n- take an unusually long amount of time to answer questions\n- struggle to balance\n- show inappropriate emotional responses, like laughing or crying without explanation\n- act out of character, like being unusually irritable\n- struggle to remember events before or after the injury\nThey may also complain about physical symptoms, including:\n- having a headache\n- being dizzy\n- feeling nauseous (sick)\n- feeling stunned or dazed\n- problems with their sight, like &#8220;seeing stars&#8221; or having blurry vision\nSome symptoms of concussion indicate that there may be a severe head injury.\nSomeone has a head injury and:\nIf you think someone may have a concussion, you should also:\n- stop them from taking part in all sport\n- have a responsible adult monitor them for 72 hours\n- not let them drive or operate heavy machinery\n- not let them drink alcohol or take recreational drugs\nThere&#8217;s no test that can rule out concussion. If someone has a head injury, it&#8217;s not possible to say for certain if someone does or does not have a concussion.\nIf someone has gone to hospital with a suspected concussion, they&#8217;ll be examined for a severe head injury. Concussion will only be diagnosed once other injuries have been ruled out.\nIf someone has a suspected concussion, but has not needed to go to hospital, they may not be given an official concussion diagnosis. You&#8217;ll be advised to assume they have a concussion and to follow the GRAS recovery plan.\nYou should not diagnose concussion without consulting a healthcare professional. Even if someone does not need to go to hospital, it&#8217;s important that you call NHS 24 on 111 for advice.\nConcussion can cause complications which can be severe. This is why you should treat anyone with a suspected concussion as if they definitely have one.\nWhen someone is recovering from concussion, they can take paracetamol to help relieve a headache. They should avoid drinking alcohol or taking recreational drugs. Getting plenty of rest and eating well will also help their recovery.\nThe graduated return to activity and sport (GRAS) recovery plan is recommended for anyone recovering from a concussion. It involves slowly increasing the amount of activity done over a period of time.\nEveryone&#8217;s journey is different. It will take some people longer to recover than others. Studies have shown that someone is more likely to take longer to recover if they:\n- are a child or young person\n- have a significant history of previous concussion\n- are a female athlete\n- have ADHD or mental health disorders\nThe minimum time someone should take to return to normal life and sport is 21 days.\nThere are 6 stages to the GRAS recovery plan. All of them involve light physical activity. This has been shown to be more beneficial than complete rest when recovering from a concussion.\nTo progress to the next stage of recovery, someone does not need to be symptom free. They can progress as long as:\n- they&#8217;ve been at their current stage for a minimum of 24 hours\n- the activity level they&#8217;re currently doing is not making their concussion symptoms significantly worse\nIf symptoms do become worse, stay at the same stage and phone NHS 24 on 111 for advice.\nRead more about gradual return to activity and sport\nThey should have relative rest for 24 to 48 hours after the injury happens. This does not mean they need to spend all their time in bed. It&#8217;s ok to do very gentle things, like taking the dog out for 10 minutes. But they should take it easy.\nThey should also keep the amount of time they spend looking at screens to a minimum. This includes TVs, computers and devices like smart phones.\nDuring stage 2 they can gradually introduce normal daily activities. They should slowly increase their physical activity around the house at this time. They can also spend more time looking at screens and devices, and doing activities like reading and games.\nDuring stage 3, they can start to do activities that take more mental effort. This is when they can start doing a bit of school work, or start working from home with breaks.\nThey can also start doing longer bits of gentle activity, like taking longer walks.\nDuring stage 4, they can return to school and work. They can also return to exercise and sports training, as long as there&#8217;s no risk of another head injury.\nAt stage 5, they can fully return to their normal life. They can also return to full training for sports.\nThey can return to competitive sport, as long as they&#8217;ve not had any symptoms for 14 days.\nAlmost everyone who has a concussion will recover well and return to normal life and sport. But, there are some complications that can come from a concussion.\nPoorly managed concussion can lead to poor performance and decision making. This can affect someone in both work and sport. This is why it&#8217;s important to follow the 6 stages of recovery for a minimum of 21 days.\nContinuing to play in a sport or game with a concussion increases the chance of getting another injury. Someone who has a concussion is 7 times more likely to get a muscle or joint injury if they play on.\nVery rarely, some people get a condition called second-impact syndrome. This can happen if one or more concussions happen close together. It can be fatal. This is why it&#8217;s important not to play on after a suspected concussion.\nHaving repeated concussions, or a prolonged concussion, can impact someone&#8217;s daily life. It can cause problems at work, in their social life, and with their mental health.\nIn some cases, symptoms of a concussion can last more than 28 days. This is called post-concussion syndrome. If someone&#8217;s concussion symptoms last for more than 28 days, they should contact their GP practice.\nRepeated, poorly managed concussions have been linked to conditions like dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Research is ongoing about the strength of this link. It&#8217;s important to be cautious and follow all recommendations when managing a concussion."

        "disease": "Congenital heart disease",
        "description": "Congenital heart disease is a general term used to refer to a series of birth defects that affect the heart.\nThere are over 30 different types of heart defect.\nThe two main types of congenital heart disease are:\n- cyanotic heart disease\n- acyanotic heart disease\nCyanotic heart is where problems with the heart mean there isn&#8217;t enough oxygen present in the blood.\nBabies born with cyanotic heart disease generally have a blue-coloured tinge to areas such as their fingers, toes and lips because of a lack of oxygen.&nbsp;\nThey may also experience symptoms of:\n- breathlessness\n- chest pain\n- palpitations\n- fainting\n- fatigue\nAcyanotic heart disease is where the blood contains enough oxygen but it&#8217;s pumped abnormally around the body.\nBabies born with acyanotic heart disease may not have any apparent symptoms but, over time, the condition can cause health problems.\nIn this group of conditions there can be a significant increase in blood pressure, putting the heart under more strain as it works much harder. This can weaken the heart, and increases the risk of developing heart failure, where the muscle is unable to efficiently pump blood around the body.\nIn addition, the blood pressure in the lungs is often too high. This is known as pulmonary hypertension and can damage the lungs and cause symptoms such as:\n- breathlessness\n- fatigue\n- dizziness\n- fainting\nCongenital heart disease is the most common type of birth defect, with 1 in 180 babies being born with the condition.\nSome babies born with congenital heart disease will require immediate surgery after birth, while many others will probably require surgery or medication at some point during their childhood. &nbsp;\nCongenital heart disease can sometimes develop alongside certain genetic conditions, such as Down’s syndrome.\nAn infection during pregnancy, such as&nbsp;rubella, can also cause congenital heart disease.\nHowever, many cases of congenital heart disease have no clear cause.\nThe outlook for congenital heart disease varies depending on the type and severity of the heart defect. &nbsp;&nbsp;\nResearch into the causes and improved treatments have meant that, 80% of children with congenital heart disease will survive into adulthood.&nbsp;\nThis poses new challenges for healthcare services because some of these adults have complex health needs and require life-long specialised care. In response to this, the Department of Health has recommended the creation of specialised centres to care for adults with congenital heart disease.&nbsp;\nCongenital heart disease in adults is sometimes known as ‘grown-up congenital heart disease’ (GUCH) or Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD).\nAs stated in the introduction, the two main types of congenital heart disease are:\n- cyanotic heart disease\n- acyanotic heart disease\nThe symptoms of cyanotic heart disease include:\n- a blue coloured tinge to the lips, fingers and toes (cyanosis)\n- palpitations\n- fainting\n- fatigue\n- chest pains\n- breathing problems\nChildren with cyanotic heart disease have lower levels of oxygen in their blood, this is known as hypoxia.\nSometimes, their oxygen levels can fall further and cause additional symptoms such as anxiety and confusion or disorientation.\nThe symptoms of acyanotic heart disease include:\n- severe tiredness\n- palpitations\n- chest pain\n- shortness of breath (particularly during activities such as climbing the stairs)\nThere are some symptoms that are present in both cyanotic and acyanotic heart disease.\nThese include:\n- poor appetite and feeding difficulties\n- sweating, particularly when a baby is feeding\n- delayed growth\nChildren with acyanotic heart disease are usually underweight, and children with cyanotic heart disease are usually underweight and small for their age.\nTo understand how congenital heart disease can affect your child’s heart and general health, it&#8217;s useful to first understand how a healthy heart works.\nFind out how your heart works, on the British Heart Foundation website.\nCongenital heart disease develops when abnormalities in the heart’s structure prevent it from working as it should.\nThe 2 main types of congenital heart disease are:\n- cyanotic heart disease\n- acyanotic heart disease\nVentricular septal defect (VSD) is a very common cause of acyanotic heart disease. In cases of VSD, there is a hole between the left and right ventricle.&nbsp;\nAs blood pressure is higher on the left-hand side of the heart, blood is pushed through the hole and into the right ventricle.\nThe heart then has to work harder to pump the excess blood out of the right ventricle, which can put a strain on the heart. The excess level and pressure of the blood can also increase the blood pressure in the lungs and damage them (pulmonary hypertension).\nAtrial septal defect (ASD) is a similar type of defect to VSD, but the hole is between the left and right atria rather than the ventricles.\nASD can place extra strain on the heart, and potentially damage the lungs.\nWhen referring to a ‘hole in the heart’, healthcare professionals are usually referring to either VSD or ASD.\nFind out more about ASD on the British Heart Foundation website\nIn pulmonary stenosis, the pulmonary valve in the right side of the heart is unusually narrow meaning that the heart has to work harder to pump blood into the lungs, which can put a strain on the heart.\nIn aortic stenosis, the aortic valve in the left side of the heart is unusually narrow, which means that the heart has to work harder to pump blood through the valve.\nBecause the aortic valve is the main route for oxygen-rich blood to supply the body, the narrowing can lower the body’s oxygen supply, which can cause symptoms of breathlessness and dizziness.\nPatent ductus ateriosus (PDA) is a duct or passage in the heart that is meant to close shortly after birth.\nWhen an unborn baby is in the womb, there is no need for the baby’s heart to send blood to the lungs because the baby is getting all the oxygen it needs from the mother through the placenta.\nTherefore, the ductus ateriosus acts as a bypass, meaning that the blood can flow back into the heart without entering the lungs.\nShortly after birth, the duct should close as the baby begins to breathe normally. However, in cases of PDA, the duct fails to completely close, which means that some oxygen-rich blood that is meant to be pumped away from the lungs leaks back through the duct and back into the lungs.\nThis can place strain on the heart and the lungs because they have to work harder to compensate for the problems caused by the duct.\nTetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is the most common cause of cyanotic heart disease. TOF is not one heart defect but a combination of four different heart defects. Tetralogy is a Greek word that means ‘four-fold’, and Fallot is the name of the doctor who first identified the condition.\nIn cases of TOF, there are four defects that affect the heart:\n- A hole between the left and right ventricle (Ventricular Septal Defect).\n- A narrowing of the pulmonary valve (pulmonary stenosis).\n- The muscles of the right ventricle are unusually thick (right ventricular hypertrophy).\n- The aorta sits over both the left and right ventricles, instead of just the left ventricle in a normal heart (overriding aorta).\nAs a result of this complex set of heart defects, oxygen-rich blood and oxygen-low blood become mixed. This leads to blood with lower-than-normal oxygen content being pumped around the body.\nAs the body’s cells and tissue are not receiving enough oxygen, the child will develop symptoms of cyanotic heart disease.\nFind out more about TOF on the British Heart Foundation website\nTransposition of the great arteries (TGA) is a major cause of cyanotic heart disease.\nIn cases of TGA, the pulmonary artery is attached to the left side of the heart, and the aorta is attached to the right side of the heart. This leads to oxygen-low blood, which should be pumped into the lungs, being pumped around the body, causing symptoms of cyanotic heart disease.\nFind out more about TGA on the British Heart Foundation website\nIn many cases of congenital heart disease, there is no clear reason why a baby is born with a defective heart.&nbsp;\nThe known risk factors for congenital heart disease are listed below.\nWomen with diabetes are five times more likely to give birth to a baby with congenital heart disease compared with women who do not have diabetes.\nIt is estimated that out of every 100 pregnancies in women with diabetes, three to four will result in the birth of a baby with a heart defect.&nbsp;\nThe increased risk is thought to be due to the high levels of insulin in the blood, which may interfere with the development of the foetus.\nThe viral infection rubella (also known as German measles) is a major risk factor for congenital heart disease if a woman contracts an infection during early pregnancy.\nIf a woman contracts the viral infection rubella (also known as German measles) during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, there is an 80% chance that her baby will be born with a birth defect, such as congenital heart disease.\nMothers who exceed the recommended daily alcohol intake during pregnancy have an increased risk of their baby being born with congenital heart disease.&nbsp;\nAlcohol is best avoided during pregnancy; however no more than 2-3 units should be consumed on a daily basis for any adult.\nThere are a number of genetic conditions (health conditions that a baby inherits from one or both parents) that can cause congenital heart disease.\nDown’s syndrome is the most widely known genetic condition that can cause congenital heart disease. Down’s syndrome is a condition where children are born with a range of disabilities as the result of a genetic abnormality. Approximately half of children with Down’s syndrome will have congenital heart disease.\nOther genetic conditions linked to congenital heart disease include:\n- Turner syndrome\n- Noonan syndrome\nAn increasing number of cases of congenital heart disease are now diagnosed by carrying out a foetal echocardiograph before a baby is born.\nA foetal echocardiograph is made possible by using a type of ultrasound scanner that has been specially designed to build a picture of the unborn baby’s heart. It should be carried out during routine antenatal examinations, usually sometime between the 18th and 20th week of pregnancy.\nIt is not always possible to detect heart defects (particularly mild ones) using a foetal echocardiography.\nIf a baby is born with cyanotic heart disease, a diagnosis can usually be made quickly and confidently due to the distinctive blue colour of their skin.\nIf your baby is born with acyanotic heart disease, their symptoms may not become immediately apparent for several months, or possibly years, after birth.&nbsp;\nPossible signs that your child may have a cyanotic heart disease include:\n- problems feeding\n- slow growth\n- shortness of breath after exercising\n- tiredness after exercising\n- swelling of their hands, feet and ankles\nYou should contact your GP if your child has any of the above symptoms. Further testing can confirm or disprove a diagnosis of congenital heart disease.\nAn echocardiogram may be used to check your child’s heart. Sometimes, underlying problems with the heart, which were missed during a foetal echocardiogram, can be detected as a child grows up.\nFind out more about an echocardiogram on the British Heart Foundation website\nAn electrocardiogram (ECG) is a test that measures the electrical activity of the child’s heart. Electrodes are placed on the skin across the chest, arms and legs, and then connected to an ECG machine. The machine analyses the electrical signals produced by the heart in order to assess the heart rhythm.\nFind out more about an ECG on the British Heart Foundation website\nA chest X-ray of the heart and lungs can check whether there are any abnormalities in the lungs, or whether the heart is larger than normal. Both of these can be signs of congenital heart disease.\nFind out more about a chest x-ray on the British Heart Foundation website\nPulse oximetry is a test that measures how much oxygen is present in the blood.&nbsp;\nThe test involves placing a special sensor on your child’s fingertip, ear or toe. The sensor sends out light waves. A computer that is connected to the sensor measures how the light waves are being absorbed, and gives a percentage reading.&nbsp;\nA healthy person should have a reading of 94% or above. It is common for those with cyanotic heart defects to have readings below this value.\nCardiac catheterisation is a useful way of finding out more information about exactly how the blood is pumping through the child’s heart.\nDuring a cardiac catheterisation, a small flexible tube, known as a catheter, will be inserted into one of the child’s blood vessels, usually in the groin or arm. The tube is moved up into the heart, using X-rays to help guide it.\nA contrast dye that shows up on X-rays can be injected into the tube. The dye can then be studied as it moves through the heart, enabling medical staff to see how well each chamber of the heart is working. Blood pressure readings in different parts of the heart can also be taken; this will help with diagnosis and treatment planning.\nCardiac catheterisation is usually performed under a local anaesthetic and is a relatively painless procedure.\nThere are a number of different surgical techniques that can be used to treat congenital heart disease. Some of these are explained below.\nA catheter, similar to the tube that is used during diagnosis, is inserted into the heart and tools are passed down the catheter to repair the heart defects.\nThe advantage of this type of surgery is that it&#8217;s minimally invasive, which means that your child will not have to have open heart surgery.\nFor more serious types of heart defects, it may be necessary to operate directly on the heart.\nDuring open heart surgery, the heart may be stopped and a machine used to pump blood around your child’s body (bypass machine). An incision is made in your child’s chest so that the heart defects can be surgically repaired, or damaged parts of the heart, such as the valves, can be replaced.\nIn more serious cases of congenital heart disease, the heart may be too damaged, and the child too ill, for corrective surgery to be safely carried out. In this circumstance, their heart may have to be replaced with a donated heart.\nIf your child requires a heart transplant, their details will be placed on the National Transplant Database (NTD). Depending on the condition of your child’s heart, it may be necessary to keep them in hospital in order to support the function of their heart until a donated heart becomes available. Machines, such as the ventricle assist device (VAD), act like an external mechanical heart, and can assist in pumping blood around the body.\nPriority for heart transplants is based on clinical need, rather than on a first-come-first-served basis. If your child is in a very unstable condition, they will be prioritised whereas more stable children will have to wait for a longer period of time.\nOnce a donated heart of the right size and blood group becomes available, you will be contacted by the transplant team and asked to go to the transplant unit as soon as possible. You may be given a bleeper so that you can be contacted as soon as possible.\nFind out more about heart transplantation on the British Heart Foundation website.\nSpecific treatments for the most common types of congenital heart disease are described below.\nIf your child is diagnosed with a ventricular septal defect (VSD) or an atrial septal defect (ASD), the recommended treatment will depend on the size of the defect.\nIf the defect is small, a policy of ‘watchful waiting’ may be recommended, where your child receives no immediate treatment but their health is carefully monitored. This is because 90% of small defects will close as the child grows older.\nIn cases of mild to medium-sized defects, it may be possible to seal the defect using a catheter. The catheter is guided to the site of the hole, and a specially designed mesh is passed through the catheter to seal the defect.\nIn cases of medium to large-sized defects, open-heart surgery may be required. This involves a patch being stitched directly over the defect.\nIf your child is diagnosed with a stenosis (a narrowing one of their valves) the treatment that is recommended will depend on the extent of the stenosis and if they are symptomatic.\nIn mild cases, a policy of ‘watchful waiting’ may be recommended. Medication that lowers blood pressure may also be recommended to reduce the strain on your child’s heart and lungs.\nIn more serious cases of stenosis, a catheter can be used to widen the valve. A small balloon is passed up through the catheter and then inflated to widen the affected valve. This is known as a balloon angioplasty. Once the valve has been widened, the balloon is removed. Sometimes, a metal coil (stent) is used to keep the valve widened.\nIn more serious cases of stenosis, it&#8217;s sometimes necessary to replace the valve using open heart surgery. Replacement valves can be obtained from human donors, or made from artificial materials, such as titanium, or taken from pigs and modified for human use. Pigs are used because their hearts are the most similar to the human heart.\nFor people who are too ill or weak to withstand the effects of open heart surgery, a catheter approach can be used. The catheter is passed through a blood vessel in the groin and up into the heart. A replacement valve is passed through the catheter and into position.\nMany cases of patent ductus ateriosus (PDA) can be treated shortly after birth, using medication.\nTwo types of medication &#8211; indomethacin and a special type of ibuprofen &#8211; have been shown to effectively stimulate the closure of the duct that is responsible for PDA.\nIf a PDA does not respond to medication, a catheter can be used to seal the duct with a metal coil or plug.\nBabies born with Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) who are experiencing severe symptoms of breathlessness may require emergency surgery such as a Blalock-Taussig shunt (a BT shunt).\nDuring a BT shunt, an artery is diverted (or shunted) into the lungs so that a supply of oxygen-rich blood becomes available. Further open-heart surgery is then recommended when the baby is old enough to withstand the after-effects of surgery. During open-heart surgery, the defect between the ventricles is sealed and the pulmonary valve is widened.\nTransposition of the great arteries (TGA) will require open-heart surgery, which is usually done shortly after your baby is born.\nA surgical technique, known as an arterial switch, is usually used to treat cases of TGA. During an arterial switch, the affected arteries are cut and reattached to their correct position on the other side of the heart.\nAbout 80% of children with congenital heart disease will survive into adulthood. Living as an adult with congenital heart disease involves a new set of challenges. Some adults will require specialised care.\nRoutine medical procedures, such as giving birth or having a general anaesthetic, will need to be closely supervised by specialist staff with experience in treating adults with congenital heart disease. There is also the risk that previous heart surgery, such as the insertion of a replacement valve, will fail and that further surgery will be required.\nDue to these factors, it&#8217;s recommended that older teenagers register with a specialised adult congenital heart disease clinic. The clinic will be able to provide regular check-ups and assessments, liaise with other specialised medical services as required, and provide on-going support and advice.\nYour GP or treatment team can give you more information about services in your area for adults with congenital heart disease.\nMany children with congenital heart disease will experience delays in their development, and may take longer to reach certain stages in their development, such as walking or talking.\nSome children with congenital heart disease also have associated learning difficulties and require specialised educational and psychological assistance.\nIf your child has congenital heart disease, your local educational authority should draw up an individual education plan (IEP). The IEP makes an assessment of your child’s current and future needs, and provides access to any specialised services that your child needs, such as speech and language therapy or an educational psychologist.\nThe IEP will take into account what level of physical activity is safe for your child. Children with congenital heart disease should be encouraged to be as active as possible, but certain activities, such as contact sports, may have to be avoided.\nBoth children and adults with congenital heart disease have an increased risk of developing endocarditis.\nEndocarditis is an infection of the lining of the heart and, left untreated, it can be life-threatening because it damages the valves of the heart.\nSymptoms of endocarditis include:\n- fever\n- chills\n- sweating (including night sweats)\n- muscular aches and pains\n- chest pain\n- coughs\n- weakness and fatigue\n- headache\n- shortness of breath\nEndocarditis will need to be with injections of antibiotics (intravenous antibiotics). This will involve a hospital stay for several weeks.\nEndocarditis usually develops when an infection in another part of the body, such as on the skin or the gums spreads through the blood into the heart.\nDue to the risk of gum disease leading to endocarditis, it is very important that you have excellent oral hygiene if you have congenital heart disease.\nIt is also usually recommended that you avoid having any cosmetic procedure that involves the piercing of the skin, such tattoos or body piercings."

        "disease": "Constipation",
        "description": "Constipation is a common condition that affects people of all ages. It can mean that you&#8217;re not passing stools regularly or you&#8217;re unable to completely empty your bowel.\nConstipation can also cause your stools to be hard and lumpy, as well as&nbsp;unusually large or small.\nThe severity of constipation varies from person to person. Many people only experience constipation for a short time, but for others, constipation can be a long-term (chronic) condition that causes significant pain and discomfort and affects quality of life.\nRead more about the symptoms of constipation.\nIt&#8217;s often difficult to identify the exact cause of constipation.&nbsp;However, there are a number of things that&nbsp;contribute to the condition, including:\n- not eating enough fibre, such as fruit, vegetables and cereals\n- a change in your routine or lifestyle, such as a change in your eating habits\n- ignoring the urge to pass stools\n- side effects of certain medications\n- not drinking enough fluids\n- anxiety&nbsp;or&nbsp;depression\nIn children, poor diet, fear about using the toilet and problems toilet training&nbsp;can all&nbsp;lead&nbsp;to constipation.\nRead more about the causes of constipation.\nConstipation can occur in babies, children and adults. It&#8217;s estimated that around 1&nbsp;in every 7&nbsp;adults and up to 1&nbsp;in every 3&nbsp;children in the UK has constipation at any one time.\nThe condition affects twice as many women as men and is also more common in older adults and during pregnancy.\nIf you have constipation you can get advice and treatment directly from a pharmacy. Find your local pharmacy on Scotland&#8217;s Service Directory.\nConstipation isn&#8217;t usually serious and can be treated by a pharmacist. Your pharmacist may recommend that you contact your GP practice if required.\nAlso speak to your pharmacist if you think your child might be constipated. Laxatives&nbsp;are often recommended for children alongside diet and lifestyle changes.\nYou may be able to treat constipation yourself by making simple changes to your diet and lifestyle (see below). If these changes don&#8217;t help and the problem continues, you should see your pharmacist.\nHowever, you should see your GP for advice if:\n- you notice any rectal bleeding\n- you notice any unexplained weight loss\n- you have persistent tiredness\n- your&nbsp;constipation lasts longer than 14 days without improvement\nDiet and lifestyle changes are usually recommended as the first treatment for constipation.\nThis includes gradually increasing your daily intake of fibre, making sure you drink plenty of fluids, and trying to get more exercise.\nIf these aren&#8217;t effective, your&nbsp;pharmacist may recommend an oral&nbsp;laxative medication&nbsp;that can&nbsp;help you empty your bowels.\nTreatment for constipation is effective, although in some cases it can take several months before a regular bowel pattern is re-established.\nRead more about treating constipation.\nMaking the diet and lifestyle changes mentioned above can also&nbsp;help to reduce your risk of developing constipation in the first place.\nGiving yourself enough time and privacy to pass stools comfortably may also help, and you should try not to&nbsp;ignore the urge to go to the toilet.\nRead more about preventing constipation.\nFor most people constipation rarely causes complications, but people with&nbsp;long-term constipation can develop:\n- haemorrhoids (piles)\n- faecal impaction (where dry, hard stools collect in the rectum)\n- bowel incontinence (the leakage of liquid stools)\nRead more about the&nbsp;complications of constipation.\nWhen you&#8217;re constipated, passing stools becomes more difficult and less frequent than usual.\nNormal bowel habits vary from person to person. Some adults go to the toilet more than once a day, whereas others may only go every 3&nbsp;or 4&nbsp;days. Similarly, some infants pass stools several times a day, while others only pass them a few times a week.\nIf you or your child pass stools less than usual, it could be a sign of constipation.\nIt may also be more difficult to pass stools and you may feel unable to empty your bowel&nbsp;completely. Your stools may appear dry, hard and lumpy, as well as abnormally large or small.\nOther symptoms of constipation can include:\n- stomach ache and cramps&nbsp;\n- feeling bloated\n- feeling&nbsp;sick\n- loss of appetite\nAs well as infrequent or irregular bowel movements, a child with constipation may also have any of the following symptoms:\n- loss of appetite\n- a lack of energy\n- being irritable, angry or unhappy\n- foul-smelling wind and stools\n- stomach&nbsp;pain and discomfort\n- soiling their clothes\n- generally feeling unwell\nConstipation usually occurs when stools remain in the colon (large intestine) for too long, and the colon absorbs too much water from the stools, causing them to become hard and dry.\nMost cases of constipation aren&#8217;t caused by a specific condition and it may be difficult to identify the exact cause. However, several factors can increase your chances of having constipation, including:\n- not eating enough fibre, such as fruit, vegetables and cereals\n- a change in your routine or lifestyle, such as a change in your eating habits\n- having limited privacy when using the toilet\n- ignoring the urge to pass stools\n- immobility or lack of exercise\n- not drinking enough fluids\n- having a high temperature (fever)\n- being underweight or overweight\n- anxiety&nbsp;or&nbsp;depression\n- psychiatric problems, such as those brought on by sexual abuse, violence or trauma\nConstipation may sometimes be a side effect of a medicine you&#8217;re taking. Common types of medication that can cause constipation include:\n- aluminium&nbsp;antacids (medicine to treat indigestion)\n- antidepressants&nbsp;\n- antiepileptics (medicine to treat epilepsy)\n- antipsychotics (medicine to treat&nbsp;schizophrenia and other mental health conditions)\n- calcium&nbsp;supplements\n- opiate painkillers, such as codeine and morphine\n- diuretics (water tablets)\n- iron&nbsp;supplements\nIf constipation is caused by medication, the condition will usually ease once you stop taking the medicine. However, you shouldn&#8217;t stop taking any prescribed medication unless your GP advises you to.\nSpeak to your pharmacist if you have constipation that&#8217;s caused by&nbsp;a medicine. They may be able to&nbsp;advise you on how to treat the problem, or they might recommend you see your GP for an alternative medicine if appropriate.\nAbout 2&nbsp;in every 5&nbsp;women experience constipation during their pregnancy, mostly during the early stages.\nConstipation occurs during pregnancy because your body produces more of the female hormone progesterone, which acts as a muscle relaxant.\nThe bowel normally moves stools and waste products to the anus by a process known as peristalsis. This is when the muscles lining the bowel contract and relax in a rippling, wave-like motion. An increase in progesterone makes it more difficult for the bowel muscles to contract, making it harder to move waste products along.\nIf you&#8217;re pregnant, there are ways to safely treat constipation without harming you or your baby. Read more about treating constipation.\nIn rare cases, constipation can be a sign of an underlying condition, such as:\n- irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\n- diabetes\n- hypercalcaemia – where there&#8217;s too much calcium in the bloodstream\n- underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)\n- muscular dystrophy&nbsp;– a genetic condition that causes muscle wasting\n- multiple sclerosis – a condition that affects the nervous system\n- Parkinson&#8217;s disease&nbsp;–&nbsp;where part of the brain becomes progressively damaged, affecting the co-ordination of body movements\n- spinal cord injury\n- anal fissure&nbsp;– a small tear or ulcer&nbsp;in the skin&nbsp;just inside the anus\n- inflammatory bowel disease&nbsp;– a condition that causes the intestines to become inflamed (irritated and swollen)\n- bowel cancer\nConstipation in babies and children is quite common. It&#8217;s estimated that up to 1&nbsp;in every 3&nbsp;children in the UK has constipation at any time. Poor diet, fear about using the toilet and poor toilet training&nbsp;can all be responsible.\nChildren who are over-fed are more likely to have constipation, as are those who don&#8217;t get enough fluids. Babies who have too much milk are also more likely to get constipation. As with adults, it&#8217;s very important that your child has enough fibre in their diet.\nIt&#8217;s important that you don&#8217;t make your child feel stressed or pressured about using the toilet. It&#8217;s also important to let your children try things by themselves (when appropriate). Constantly intervening when they&#8217;re using the toilet may make them feel anxious and may contribute to constipation.\nSome children can feel stressed or anxious about using the toilet. They may have a phobia about using the toilet, or feel they are unable to use the toilets at school.\nThis fear may be the result of your child experiencing pain when passing stools. This can lead to poor bowel habits, where children ignore the urge to pass stools and instead withhold them for fear of experiencing pain and discomfort. However, if they do this, their condition will only get worse.\nIn rare cases, constipation in babies and children can be a sign of an underlying condition, such as:\n- Hirschsprung&#8217;s disease – which affects the bowel, making it difficult to pass stools\n- anorectal malformation – where the baby&#8217;s anus and rectum don&#8217;t form properly\n- spinal cord abnormalities – including rare conditions such as spina bifida and cerebral palsy\n- cystic fibrosis – a genetic condition that causes the body to produce thick and sticky mucus, which can lead to constipation\nConstipation is a very common condition. Your pharmacist won&#8217;t usually need to carry out any tests or procedures, but will confirm a diagnosis based on your symptoms and medical history.\nYour pharmacist will ask you some questions about your bowel habits. Don&#8217;t feel embarrassed about discussing this with your pharmacist. It&#8217;s important they&#8217;re aware of all of your symptoms, so they can make the correct diagnosis.\nYour pharmacist may also ask questions about your diet, level of exercise and whether there have been any recent changes to your routines.\nConstipation can be defined in a number of ways:\n- opening the bowels less than 3&nbsp;times a week\n- needing to strain to open your bowels on more than a quarter of occasions\n- passing a hard or pellet-like stool on more than a quarter of occasions\nIf your pharmacist thinks you may have faecal impaction (when dry, hard stools collect in your rectum), they may advise you to contact your GP for a physical examination. Read complications of constipation for more information about faecal impaction.\nA typical examination will begin with you lying on your back, while the GP feels your abdomen (tummy). You&#8217;ll then lie on your side while your GP carries out a rectal examination using a lubricated, gloved finger. Your GP will be able to feel for any stools that may have collected.\nAn internal physical examination rarely needs to be carried out on a child. Instead, the diagnosis can usually be made by feeling the child&#8217;s tummy.\nIf you&#8217;re experiencing severe symptoms, your doctor may request further tests, such as blood tests or thyroid tests, to diagnose or rule out other conditions.\nOther tests you may have include:\n- an abdominal X-ray&nbsp;– where X-ray&nbsp;radiation is used to produce images of the inside of your abdomen\n- transit study examination – where you take a short course of special capsules that show up on X-rays; one or more X-rays are taken later on to see how long it takes for the capsules to pass through your digestive system\n- anorectal manometry – where a small device with a balloon at one end is inserted into your rectum and&nbsp;attached to a machine that measures pressure readings from the balloon as you squeeze, relax and push your rectum muscles; this gives an idea of how well the muscles and nerves in and around your rectum are working\nAs there&#8217;s an increased risk of bowel cancer in older adults, your doctor may also request tests to rule out a diagnosis of cancer, including a computerised tomography (CT) scan&nbsp;or colonoscopy.\nTreatment for constipation depends on the cause, how long you&#8217;ve had it and how severe your symptoms are.\nIn many cases, it&#8217;s possible to relieve the symptoms by making dietary and lifestyle changes.\nChanges to diet and lifestyle are often recommended as the first treatment for constipation. In many cases,&nbsp;this will improve the condition&nbsp;without the need for medication.\nSome self-help methods of treating constipation are:\n- increase your daily intake of fibre (you should eat at least 18 to 30g of fibre a day)\n- add some bulking agents, such as wheat bran, to your diet to help make your stools softer and easier to pass\n- avoid dehydration by drinking plenty of water\n- exercise more regularly – for example, by going for a daily walk or run\n- if constipation is causing pain or discomfort, you may want to take a painkiller, such as paracetamol – always follow the dosage instructions carefully; children under 16 shouldn&#8217;t take aspirin\n- keep to a routine (a place and time of day) when you&#8217;re able to spend time on the toilet and respond to your bowel&#8217;s natural pattern: when you feel the urge, don&#8217;t delay\n- try resting your feet on a low stool while going to the toilet, so that your knees are above your hips; this can make passing stools easier\n- if medication you&#8217;re taking could be causing constipation, your GP may be able to prescribe an alternative\nRead about&nbsp;preventing constipation for more ways to change your diet and lifestyle.\nYour pharmacist may recommend an oral laxative if diet and lifestyle changes don&#8217;t help.\nLaxatives&nbsp;are a type of medicine that help you pass stools. There are several different types of laxative and each one has a different effect on your digestive system.\nYour pharmacist will usually start&nbsp;you on&nbsp;a bulk-forming laxative. These work by helping your stools to retain fluid. This means they&#8217;re less likely to dry out, which can lead to faecal impaction. Bulk-forming laxatives also make your stools softer, which means they should be easier to pass.\nCommonly prescribed bulk-forming laxatives include ispaghula husk,&nbsp;methylcellulose and sterculia. When taking this type of laxative, you must drink plenty of fluids, and don&#8217;t take them before going to bed. It will usually be 2&nbsp;to 3&nbsp;days before you feel the effects of a bulk-forming laxative.\nIf your stools remain hard after you&#8217;ve taken a bulk-forming laxative, your pharmacist may prescribe an osmotic laxative instead. Osmotic laxatives increase the amount of fluid in your bowels. This&nbsp;softens your stools and stimulates your body to pass them.\nCommonly prescribed osmotic laxatives include&nbsp;lactulose and macrogols. As with bulk-forming laxatives, make sure you drink enough fluids. It will usually be 2&nbsp;to 3&nbsp;days before you feel the effect of the laxative.\nIf your stools are soft, but you still have difficulty passing them, your pharmacist may recommend a stimulant laxative. This type of laxative stimulates the muscles that line your digestive tract, helping them to move stools and waste products along your large intestine to your anus.\nThe most commonly prescribed stimulant laxatives are senna, bisacodyl and sodium picosulphate. These laxatives are usually only used on a short-term basis, and they start to work within 6 to 12 hours.\nAccording to your individual preference and&nbsp;how quickly&nbsp;you need&nbsp;relief, your pharmacist may decide to combine different laxatives.\nIf you&#8217;ve had constipation for a short time, your pharmacist will usually advise you to stop taking the laxative once your stools are soft and easily passed.\nHowever, if your constipation&nbsp;is caused by&nbsp;an underlying medical condition or a medicine you&#8217;re taking,&nbsp;your GP may advise you to take laxatives for much longer, possibly many months or&nbsp;even years.\nIf you&#8217;ve been taking laxatives for some time, you may have to gradually reduce your dose, rather than coming off them straight away. If you have been prescribed a combination of laxatives, you&#8217;ll normally have to reduce the dosage of each laxative, one at a time, before you can stop taking them. This can take several months.\nYour GP will advise you about when it&#8217;s best to stop taking long-term laxatives.&nbsp;\nFaecal impaction occurs when stools become hard and dry and collect in your rectum. This obstructs the rectum, making it more difficult for stools to pass along.\nSometimes as a result of impaction, overflow&nbsp;diarrhoea may occur (where loose stools leak around the obstruction). You may have difficulty controlling this.\nIf you have faecal impaction, you&#8217;ll initially be treated with a high dose of the osmotic laxative macrogol. After a few days of using macrogol, you may also have to start taking a stimulant laxative.\nIf you don&#8217;t respond to these laxatives, and/or if you have overflow diarrhoea, you may need one of the following medications.\nSuppository – this type of medicine is inserted into your anus. The suppository gradually dissolves at body temperature and is then absorbed into your bloodstream. Bisacodyl is an example of a medication that can be given in suppository form.\nMini enema – where a medicine in fluid form is injected through your anus and into your large bowel. Docusate and sodium citrate can be given in this way.\nIf you&#8217;re pregnant, there are ways for you to safely treat constipation without harming you or your baby. Your pharmacist will first advise you to change your diet by increasing fibre and fluid intake. You&#8217;ll also be advised to do gentle exercise.\nIf dietary and lifestyle changes don&#8217;t work, you may be prescribed a laxative to help you pass stools more regularly.\nLots of laxatives are safe for pregnant women to use because most aren&#8217;t absorbed by the digestive system. This means that your baby won&#8217;t feel the effects of the laxative.\nLaxatives that are safe to use during pregnancy include the osmotic laxatives lactulose and macrogols. If these don&#8217;t work, your pharmacist may recommend taking a small dose of bisacodyl or senna (stimulant laxatives).\nHowever, senna may not be suitable if you&#8217;re in your third trimester of pregnancy, because it&#8217;s partially absorbed by your digestive system.\nRead more about constipation and other common pregnancy problems.\nIf your baby is constipated but hasn&#8217;t started to eat solid foods, the first way to treat them is to give them extra water between their normal feeds. If you&#8217;re using formula milk, make the formula as directed by the manufacturer and don&#8217;t dilute the mixture.\nYou may want to try gently moving your baby&#8217;s legs in a bicycling motion or carefully massaging their tummy to help stimulate their bowels.\nIf your baby is eating solid foods, give them plenty of water or diluted fruit juice. Try to encourage them to eat fruit, which can be puréed or chopped, depending on their ability to chew. The best fruits for babies to eat to treat constipation are:\n- apples\n- apricots\n- grapes\n- peaches\n- pears\n- plums\n- prunes\n- raspberries\n- strawberries\nNever force your baby to eat food if they don&#8217;t want to. If you do, it can turn mealtimes into a battle and your child may start to think of eating as a negative and stressful experience.\nIf your baby is still constipated after a change in diet, they may have to be prescribed a laxative. Bulk-forming laxatives aren&#8217;t suitable for babies, so they&#8217;ll usually be given an osmotic laxative. However, if this doesn&#8217;t work, they can be prescribed a stimulant laxative.\nFor&nbsp;children, laxatives are often recommended alongside changes to diet. Osmotic laxatives are usually tried first, followed by a stimulant laxative if necessary.\nAs well as eating fruit, older children should have a healthy, balanced diet, which also contains vegetables and wholegrain foods, such as wholemeal bread and pasta.\nTry to minimise stress or conflict associated with meal times or&nbsp;using the toilet. It&#8217;s important to be positive and encouraging when it comes to establishing a toilet routine. Allow your child&nbsp;at least 10 minutes on the toilet, to make sure they&#8217;ve passed as many stools as possible.\nTo encourage a positive toilet routine, try making a diary of your child&#8217;s bowel movements linked to a reward system. This can help them focus on using the toilet successfully.\nConstipation rarely causes any complications or long-term health problems. Treatment is usually effective, particularly if it&#8217;s started promptly.\nHowever, if you have long-term (chronic) constipation, you may be more at risk of experiencing complications.\nContinually straining to pass stools can cause pain, discomfort and rectal bleeding.\nIn some cases, bleeding is the result of a small tear around the anus (anal fissure), but it&#8217;s more often caused by&nbsp;haemorrhoids (piles). Piles are swollen blood vessels that form in the lower rectum and anus.\nAs well as bleeding, piles can also cause pain, itching around the anus, and swelling of the anus.\nThe&nbsp;symptoms of piles often settle down after a few days without treatment. However, creams and ointments are available to reduce any itching or discomfort.\nSee your pharmacist as soon as possible if you experience any rectal bleeding.\nLong-term constipation can increase the risk of faecal impaction, which&nbsp;is where dried, hard stools collect in your rectum and anus.\nOnce you have faecal impaction, it&#8217;s very unlikely that you&#8217;ll be able to get rid of the stools naturally.\nFaecal impaction makes constipation worse because it&#8217;s harder for stools and waste products to pass out of your anus, as the path is obstructed.\nFaecal impaction can sometimes lead to a number of other complications, including:\n- swelling of the rectum\n- a loss of sensation in and around your anus\n- bowel&nbsp;incontinence\n- bleeding from your anus\n- rectal prolapse&nbsp;– where part of your lower intestine falls out of place and protrudes from your anus (this can also occur&nbsp;as a result of&nbsp;repeated straining in people with&nbsp;chronic constipation)\nFaecal impaction is usually treated with laxative medication, although suppositories (medication inserted into the anus) and&nbsp;mini enemas (where medicine in fluid form is injected through your anus) may sometimes be used.\nThere are a number of things you can do to prevent constipation, including making diet and lifestyle changes.\nIncluding&nbsp;enough fibre in your diet can significantly reduce your chances of developing constipation. Most adults don&#8217;t eat enough fibre.\nYou should aim to have about 30g of fibre a day. You can increase your fibre intake by eating more:\n- fruit and vegetables\n- wholegrain rice\n- wholewheat pasta\n- wholemeal bread\n- seeds and oats\nEating more fibre will keep your bowel movements regular, because it helps food pass through your digestive system more easily. Foods high in fibre also make you feel fuller for longer.\nIt&#8217;s important to increase your fibre intake gradually, because a sudden increase may make you feel bloated. Suddenly increasing your intake of fibre may also cause you to produce more wind&nbsp;(flatulence) and experience stomach cramps.\nRead more about&nbsp;how to increase your intake of fibre and eating a healthy, balanced diet.\nMake sure you drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration, and steadily increase your intake when exercising or when it&#8217;s hot. Try to cut back on the amount of caffeine, alcohol and fizzy drinks you consume.\nNever ignore the urge to go to the toilet, because it can significantly increase your chances of having constipation.\nWhen going to the toilet, make sure you have enough time and privacy to pass stools comfortably.\nKeeping active and&nbsp;mobile will greatly reduce your risk of getting constipation. You should do at least 150 minutes of physical activity every week.\nAs well as regular exercise reducing your risk of becoming constipated, it will also leave you feeling healthier and improve your mood, energy levels and general fitness.\nRead more about health and fitness&nbsp;and physical activity guidelines for adults."

        "description": "You or someone else has symptoms like:\nCoronary heart disease (CHD) is a term used to describe what happens when the blood flow to the heart is interrupted or reduced. It is also known as ischaemic heart disease.\nOften, the reduction or blockage in blood flow is caused by atherosclerosis. This is when a fatty material called atheroma builds up inside the coronary arteries. This can narrow the coronary arteries, reducing the blood flow.\nIf a piece of atheroma breaks off, this can cause a blockage and cut off blood supply to the heart. This is known as a heart attack.\nFurther information is available about the diagnosis, treatment and management of:\n- a heart attack\n- angina\nThe main symptoms of coronary heart disease are:\n- chest pain (angina)\n- shortness of breath\n- pain throughout the body\n- feeling faint\n- feeling sick (nausea)\nHeart failure&nbsp;can sometimes occur in people with CHD. This is when the heart becomes too weak to pump blood around the body. This can cause fluid to build up in the lungs, making it increasingly difficult to breathe.\nMicrovascular angina is a problem with tiny blood vessels that supply blood to your heart. It may be caused when these tiny blood vessels:\n- can&#8217;t open up properly to let your blood flow\n- severely narrow, blocking blood flow to the heart\nThe main symptom of microvascular angina is chest pain. You may feel it at any time.\nLifestyle changes can often improve symptoms.\nRead further information about microvascular angina\nFurther information is available on the impact of heart disease on women\nMany different tests may be used to diagnose coronary heart disease, including:\n- CT coronary angiography (CTCA)\n- coronary angiography\n- electrocardiogram (ECG)\n- thallium scan (myocardial perfusion scintigraphy)\n- magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nThere are various risk factors for heart disease, some of which you have control over and others that you don’t.\nUncontrollable risk factors for heart disease include:\n- age\n- family history of heart disease or stroke\n- ethnicity\n- being post-menopausal\nYour risk can also be increased by certain lifestyle factors. These are sometimes called controllable risk factors. For example, your diet, level of physical activity and smoking habits.\nYou can make lifestyle changes to reduce your risk of heart disease, including:\n- eating a balanced diet\n- weight management\n- keeping active and exercising regularly\n- stopping smoking\nIf you&#8217;ve been diagnosed with some other health conditions, you might also be at increased risk of heart disease. These conditions include:\n- hypertension (high blood pressure)\n- high cholesterol\n- type 2 diabetes\n- polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\n- inflammatory diseases, including&nbsp;rheumatoid arthritis\nYou might find support groups useful if you:\n- have a heart condition\n- have had a heart condition in the past\n- are caring for someone with a heart condition\nYour GP or specialist should be able to provide you with details about your nearest support group.

Like all medicines, no vaccine is completely effective. Some people may still get coronavirus despite having a vaccine, but any illness should be less severe. There’s still a chance you might catch coronavirus, or another respiratory infection, if you’re vaccinated, and pass it on to other people.\nMost people no longer need to take a coronavirus test. You can still access testing if you have a health condition which means&nbsp;you’re eligible for coronavirus treatments.\nTo prevent the spread of infection, you should stay at home and avoid contact with other people if you’re unwell. When you no longer have a fever (if you had one) and don’t need medicine to control your fever, you can return to normal activities. For example, work, school, and social events. There&#8217;s no specific time limit you need to avoid contact with others. You can use 48 hours as a rough guide.\nSymptoms of coronavirus include:\n- high temperature, fever or chills\n- feeling generally unwell\n- continuous cough\n- loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell\n- shortness of breath\n- unexplained tiredness, lack of energy\n- muscle aches or pains that are not due to exercise\n- not wanting to eat or not feeling hungry\n- headache that’s unusual or longer lasting than usual\n- sore throat, stuffy or runny nose\n- diarrhoea\n- feeling sick or being sick\nYou might continue to have a&nbsp;cough&nbsp;or feel tired after your other symptoms have improved. This does not mean that you’re still infectious.\nAntibiotics will not relieve your symptoms or speed up your recovery.\nYou or your child:\nIf your GP is closed, phone 111. In an emergency phone 999.\nIt&#8217;s particularly important to get help if you&#8217;re at increased risk of becoming more unwell from coronavirus such as if you&#8217;re pregnant, aged 60 or over, or have a weakened immune system.\nComplete our self-help guide to check your symptoms and find out what to do next.\nThere are things you can do to reduce the spread of infection if you have symptoms or have tested positive.\nTo prevent the spread of infection, you should stay at home and avoid contact with other people if you’re unwell. When you no longer have a fever (if you had one) and don’t need medicine to control your fever, you can return to normal activities. For example, work, school, and social events. There&#8217;s no specific time limit you need to avoid contact with others. You can use 48 hours as a rough guide.\nIf you have respiratory symptoms:\n- stay away from people at increased risk of becoming more unwell from coronavirus\n- do not visit hospitals or care homes\nIn older adult care homes, residents who have tested positive for coronavirus should self-isolate for at least 5 days and until they&#8217;ve been fever-free for at least 48 hours without taking medicine to control their temperature.\nRespiratory infections are common in children and young people, particularly during the winter months. Symptoms can be caused by several respiratory infections including the common cold, coronavirus and RSV.\nChildren and young people with mild symptoms who are otherwise well can continue to attend their education setting. Mild symptoms include a runny nose, sore throat, or slight cough.\nIf a child or young person aged 18 or under tests positive or has respiratory symptoms, they should stay at home. When they no longer have a fever (if they had one), and don&#8217;t need medicine to control the fever, they can return to normal activities. There&#8217;s no specific time limit they need to avoid contact with others. You can use 48 hours as a rough guide.\nChildren and young people tend to be infectious for less time than adults.\nFor most children and young people, these illnesses will not be serious. They’ll soon recover following rest and plenty of fluids.\nVery few children and young people with respiratory infections become seriously unwell.\nChildren and young people who usually go to school, college or childcare and who live with someone who has a positive coronavirus test result should continue to attend as normal.\nThe Self-Isolation Support Grant closed on 5 January 2023.

        "disease": "Costochondritis",
        "description": "This information may be useful for those who have been diagnosed with costochondritis. If you&#8217;re experiencing new or ongoing symptoms you should contact your healthcare professional. You might need an assessment to help with diagnosis and treatment.\nWhen the costochondral joint becomes inflamed it can result in sharp chest pain and tenderness. These symptoms may develop gradually or start suddenly.\nYou or someone else has symptoms like:\nIf your GP surgery is closed, contact 111.\nCostochondritis is the medical term for inflammation of the cartilage that joins your ribs to your breastbone (sternum).\nCartilage is tough but flexible connective tissue. It acts as a shock absorber, cushioning the joints.\nCostochondritis will normally improve on its own after a few weeks but sometimes takes longer. The condition doesn’t lead to any permanent problems, but can occasionally flare up.\nThe main symptom of costochondritis is chest pain that appears centrally. The pain doesn&#8217;t usually spread across the chest or into the arms.\nThe pain may be made worse by:\n- certain positions or activities, like wearing a seatbelt or hugging someone\n- deep breathing\n- coughing and sneezing\nModifying your activities while you recover may help reduce your symptoms.\nInflammation is the body’s natural response to infection, irritation or injury.\nIt’s not known exactly why this area becomes inflamed but in some cases it’s been linked to:\n- severe coughing which strains your chest area\n- an injury to your chest\n- physical strain from repeated exercise or sudden exertion that you’re not used to, such as moving furniture\n- an infection, including respiratory tract infections (RTIs)\nFor costochondritis to be diagnosed you’ll need an assessment from a healthcare professional.\nThey’ll initially ask you questions and then carry out a physical examination.\nYou may sometimes need to have a further examination. This is to rule out other possible health conditions.\nCostochondritis often gets better after a few weeks. It&#8217;s often referred to as a self limiting condition. This means it can get better on its own over time. Self-help steps and painkillers can help manage your symptoms.\nCostochondritis can be made worse by any activity that places stress on your chest area, for example strenuous exercise or repetitive movements.\nAny movement that makes the pain in your chest area worse should be modified until the inflammation in your ribs and cartilage has improved.\nSome examples of modified activity include:\n- taking regular breaks\n- changing your position regularly while sitting or lying down\n- holding objects close to your body when lifting them\n- hugging a cushion while you cough\nThe following can help to reduce the pain:\n- pain medication – this can help you move more comfortably, which can help your recovery\n- heat packs\nMore about taking painkillers.\nRemember to never place heat directly on your skin. Use a barrier, like a towel, to protect your skin from a burn.\nHow long you use heat as a treatment can depend on the painful area. Generally up to 15 minutes of heat, leaving a few hours between treatments, is the most useful.\nYou should stop treating the area with heat and seek advice from a medical professional if you notice:\n- an increase in redness\n- discolouration\n- blistering of the skin\nIf you have any issues with circulation or sensation, you shouldn’t use heat as a treatment.\nIt’s important to try to keep moving as normally as possible during your recovery. It’s best to avoid long periods of rest where possible.\nYou can try to increase your activity gradually to help your recovery.\nToo much rest can slow down your recovery. As soon as you can, start moving and using the affected area.\nRemember a little activity is better than nothing. Continue to stay within acceptable pain limits but you don’t need to be pain free. Aim to do a little bit more each day or every few days.\nThis guide can help you to understand if you’re pacing your daily activities at the right level as you progress. It’ll also let you see how much pain or discomfort is acceptable.\nIt can be helpful to rate your pain out of 10 (0 being no pain, 10 being the worst pain you’ve ever had), for example:\n- 0 to 3 – minimal pain\n- 4 to 5 – acceptable pain\n- 6 to 10 – excessive pain\nActivity should not make your existing pain worse overall. Increasing activity can lead to increased discomfort as your body gets used to regaining your activity levels.\nAim to keep your pain within a rating of 0 to 5. If your pain gets above this level, you can change the level of activity by:\n- reducing the number of times you do a movement\n- reducing the pace of an activity\n- increasing rest time between activities\nYour return to work will depend on the type of work you do and your employer. It may be possible to discuss a phased return to work or changed duties.\nYou don’t need to see a healthcare professional to return to work.\nKeep doing any activities you’re able to, as your pain allows. Gradually increase what you do.\nYour symptoms may make things more difficult to start with. This will get better as you slowly build up to all of your usual activities.\nIf your symptoms worsen or haven’t improved within 8 weeks following this advice, it’s a good idea to talk to a healthcare professional.\nFind out how to access MSK services in your area.\nWhen dealing with any health condition it’s important to also look after your mental wellbeing as this can impact your recovery."

It&#8217;s rarely a sign of anything serious.\nMost coughs clear up within 3 weeks and don&#8217;t need any treatment.\nA dry cough means it&#8217;s tickly and doesn&#8217;t produce any mucus (phlegm). A chesty cough means phlegm is produced to help clear your airways.\nIf you smoke, quitting is likely to help improve your cough. Read more about stopping smoking.\nComplete our self-help guide to check your symptoms and find out what to do next.\nYour child:\nYour child:\nIf your GP practice is closed, phone 111.\nIf your GP is unsure what&#8217;s causing your cough, they may refer you to a specialist. They may also request some tests, such as a chest X-ray, allergy tests, breathing tests, and an analysis of a sample of your phlegm to check for infection.\nTreatment isn&#8217;t always necessary for short-term coughs because it&#8217;s likely to be a viral infection that will get better on its own within a few weeks.\nYou can speak to a pharmacist for advice about coughs and cough treatments.\nThere&#8217;s no evidence that cough medicines work.\nOver-the-counter cough and cold medicines shouldn&#8217;t be given to children under the age of 6. Children aged 6 to 12 should only use them on the advice of a pharmacist or doctor.\nA homemade remedy containing honey and lemon is likely to be just as useful and safer to take. Honey shouldn&#8217;t be given to babies under the age of 1.\nIf your cough has a specific cause, treating this may help. For example:\n- asthma can be treated with inhaled steroids to reduce inflammation in your airways\n- allergies can be treated by avoiding things you&#8217;re allergic to and taking antihistamines\n- bacterial infections can be treated with antibiotics\n- reflux, also known as GORD, can be treated with antacids to neutralise your stomach acid and medication to reduce the amount of acid your stomach produces\n- COPD can be treated with bronchodilators to widen your airways\nCommon causes of a short-term cough include:\n- an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) that affects the throat, windpipe or sinuses – for example a cold, flu, laryngitis, sinusitis or whooping cough\n- a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) that affects your lungs or lower airways – for example acute bronchitis or pneumonia\n- an allergy, such as allergic rhinitis or hay fever\n- a flare-up of a long-term condition such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or bronchiectasis\n- breathing in dust or smoke\nA persistent cough may be caused by:\n- asthma – this also usually causes other symptoms, such as wheezing, chest tightness and shortness of breath\n- an allergy\n- smoking – a smoker&#8217;s cough can also be a symptom of COPD\n- bronchiectasis – where the airways of the lungs become abnormally widened\n- gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) – where the throat becomes irritated by stomach acid\n- a prescribed medicine, such as an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor), which is used to treat high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease – examples include ramipril and lisinopril\nIn most cases, a doctor will need to know if you are producing much more or darker phlegm than usual.\nOften, the cause of a persistent cough is unknown (idiopathic).\nRarely, a persistent cough can be a symptom of a more serious condition, such as lung cancer, heart failure, a pulmonary embolism (blood clot on the lung) or tuberculosis.\nCoughs in children can also be caused by respiratory tract infections, asthma or GORD.\nCauses of coughs that are more common in children than adults include:\n- bronchiolitis – a mild respiratory tract infection that usually causes cold-like symptoms\n- croup – causes a distinctive barking cough and a harsh sound known as stridor when the child breathes in\n- whooping cough – causes symptoms such as intense, hacking bouts of coughing, vomiting, and a &#8216;whoop&#8217; sound with each sharp intake of breath after coughing\nOccasionally, a persistent cough in a child can be a sign of a serious long-term condition, such as cystic fibrosis.\nRead more about what to do if your child has cold or flu symptoms"

        "disease": "Crohn’s disease",
        "description": "Crohn&#8217;s disease is a long-term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system.\nInflammation can affect any part of the digestive system, from the mouth to the back passage. But it mostly occurs in the last section of the small intestine (ileum) or the large intestine (colon).\nCrohn&#8217;s disease can affect people of all ages, but it’s usually diagnosed between the age of 15 and 40.\nThe symptoms of Crohn&#8217;s disease vary. They depend on which part of the digestive system is inflamed.\nCommon symptoms include:\n- recurring&nbsp;diarrhoea\n- abdominal pain&nbsp;and cramping, which is usually worse after eating\n- extreme tiredness (fatigue)\n- unintended weight loss\n- blood and mucus in your poo\nYou may have long periods without symptoms, or very mild symptoms. This is known as remission. This may be followed by periods where the symptoms are particularly troublesome. These are known as flare-ups or relapses.\nLess common symptoms include:\n- a high temperature (fever) of 38°C (100°F) or above\n- feeling sick (nausea)\n- being sick (vomiting)\n- joint pain and swelling (arthritis)\n- inflammation and irritation of the eyes (uveitis)\n- areas of painful, red and swollen skin – most often the legs\n- mouth ulcers\n- anal pain and discharge due to perianal Crohn’s\nChildren with Crohn&#8217;s disease may grow at a slower rate than expected.\nThe exact cause of Crohn&#8217;s disease is unknown.\nA combination of factors may be responsible, including:\n- genetics – genes you inherit from your parents\n- a problem with the immune system (the body&#8217;s defence against infection and illness) – where it attacks healthy bacteria in the gut and causes inflammation\n- environmental factors – like air pollution, medication or previous infections\n- smoking – smokers are twice as likely to develop Crohn&#8217;s disease, and usually have more severe symptoms than non-smokers\nYour GP will usually ask you about:\n- your pattern of symptoms\n- your diet\n- any recent travel – for example, you may have developed travellers&#8217; diarrhoea\n- whether you&#8217;re taking any medication, including any over-the-counter medicines\n- whether anyone else in your family has any bowel conditions\nYour GP may also carry out a tests to check your general health. For example, they may:\n- check your pulse\n- check your blood pressure\n- measure your height and weight\n- measure your temperature\n- examine your abdomen (tummy)\nYour GP may also:\n- arrange&nbsp;blood tests&nbsp;to check for inflammation, infection and&nbsp;anaemia\n- ask for a stool (poo) sample to use a qFIT test to check for blood and mucus, infection or inflammation via a faecal calprotectin test\nYou may be referred to a gastroenterologist. A gastroenterologist is a specialist in conditions of the digestive system. They might recommend more tests, such as:\n- gastroscopy – a thin flexible tube with a camera is put into your mouth to look at your food pipe and stomach\n- colonoscopy – a thin, flexible tube with a camera is put into your bottom to look at the whole of your large bowel\n- sigmoidoscopy – a thin, flexible tube with a camera is put into your bottom to look at the end of your large bowel\n- a colon capsule endoscopy&nbsp;(pill camera)\n- X-ray&nbsp;or&nbsp;barium enema\n- MRI scan&nbsp;or&nbsp;CT scan\nYou will be told what tests you need and what you need to do to prepare for them.\nThere&#8217;s currently no cure for Crohn&#8217;s disease, but treatment can improve the symptoms and keep the inflammation under control.\nYour treatment will usually be provided by a range of healthcare professionals.\nOnce your symptoms are under control, you are likely to be offered treatment to help keep them under control. If your Crohn&#8217;s stays under control for a long time, you may choose to stop treatment. You may need to start again if your symptoms come back.\nThe first treatment offered is usually steroids, such as prednisolone or budesonide (corticosteroids) to reduce inflammation quickly. Steroids are often effective in reducing your symptoms. But they can have significant&nbsp;side effects. So they’re not suitable for long-term use and your dose will slowly be reduced when your symptoms start to improve.\nMedicines to suppress your immune system (immunosuppressants) may be given alongside steroids if your symptoms flare up twice or more during 12 months, or return when your steroid dose is reduced.\nCommon types include azathioprine, mercaptopurine and methotrexate.\nIf steroids and immunosuppressants don&#8217;t help or aren&#8217;t right for you, biological therapies may be used.\nBiological therapies block particular chemicals involved in the immune response, which helps reduce inflammation. They&#8217;re made using living cells in a lab. They can be given as a drip or an injection. Treatment usually lasts at least 12 months. Your inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) team will be able to discuss these with you.\nCommon types are adalimumab, infliximab, ustekinumab or vedolizumab.\nThere&#8217;s a risk that these medicines may cause side effects, which can cause symptoms such as:\n- itchy skin\n- a high temperature\n- joint and muscle pain\n- swelling of the hands or lips\n- problems swallowing\nYou should seek immediate medical help if you experience these symptoms. Reactions can occur immediately after treatment or months later, even after treatment stops.\nSurgery to treat Crohn’s disease may be an option if:\n- you choose to have surgery instead of taking medications that may cause side effects\n- medications don&#8217;t control your symptoms\n- your quality of life is severely affected by your condition\n- you have serious complications of Crohn’s disease\nSurgery might involve widening narrow parts of your bowel, or removing parts of it (resection).\nResection involves removing the inflamed area of the intestine.\nIf you have a resection, you might have the healthy sections of bowel joined back together. Or you might have the end of your small bowel joined to the skin of your tummy (an&nbsp;ileostomy&nbsp;or stoma). In this case, poo comes out of the opening on your tummy and is collected in special bags that you wear. An ileostomy might be temporary, to give your bowel time to heal, or it might be permanent.\nYour IBD team will tell you what surgery they recommend and let you know what to expect.\nThere is no evidence that a particular diet causes or triggers flare-ups of Crohn’s disease. But alongside medications, some changes to your diet may help control symptoms for some people.\n\n\nDo not make major changes to your diet without talking to your IBD team and make sure you are still getting all the nutrients you need. You can speak to your IBD team about:\n- keeping a food diary to find out if any particular foods affect your symptoms\n- removing trigger foods from your diet&nbsp;\n- taking a food supplement if you are struggling to get enough nutrients from your diet\n- being referred to a dietitian\nIf you smoke, it is advised that you make every effort to stop smoking, especially if you need to have surgery.\nIf you smoke, smoking can make Crohn’s worse and is it important that you make every effort to&nbsp;stop smoking.\nA woman&#8217;s chance of becoming pregnant isn&#8217;t usually affected by Crohn’s disease.\nHowever, surgery for Crohn’s disease might affect your fertility.\nMost women with Crohn’s disease will have a normal pregnancy and a healthy baby. But if you&#8217;re pregnant or planning a pregnancy you should discuss it with your IBD team. This is because they may need to change your medication.\nIf you&#8217;re having a flare-up of Crohn’s disease you may also be advised to avoid getting pregnant until it&#8217;s under control.\nOver time, inflammation can damage sections of the digestive system. This can result in complications such as:\n- narrowing of the bowel (stricture)\n- a channel developing between your bowel and your skin, another section of bowel or a body organ (fistula)\nThese problems usually need surgical treatment.\nIf you have Crohn&#8217;s disease, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).\nThis helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.\nFind out more about the register"

        "disease": "Croup",
        "description": "Croup is a childhood condition that affects the windpipe (trachea), the airways to the lungs (the bronchi) and the voice box (larynx).\nCroup usually affects young children aged between 6 months and 3 years, though they could be younger or older. Most cases happen in 1 year olds. It&#8217;s more common during the late autumn and early winter months. It tends to affect more boys than girls. A child can have croup more than once.\nCroup in adults is rare.\nChildren with croup have a barking cough that sounds like a seal. They&#8217;ll make a harsh sound, known as stridor, when they breathe in. Stridor is often most noticeable when the child cries or coughs. They may also have a hoarse voice and find it difficult to breathe because their airway is blocked.\nSome children have cold-like symptoms for a few days before developing croup symptoms. Croup symptoms usually only last for a few days and are often worse at night. But they can occasionally last up to 2 weeks.\nYour child:\nYour child:\nIf your GP practice is closed, phone 111.\nCroup can usually be diagnosed by a GP. They&#8217;ll check your child&#8217;s symptoms, particularly the sound of their cough. If you can, record the noise your child is making on your phone so your GP can hear it. This can be helpful if your child only coughs at night.\nYour GP may also:\n- check your child&#8217;s temperature\n- ask whether your child has recently had a cold or viral infection\n- do a pulse oximetry test to check your child&#8217;s oxygen levels (this involves clipping a sensor onto your child&#8217;s earlobe or finger – it does not hurt)\n- rule out other conditions with more tests\nYour GP will decide whether your child needs to go to hospital or whether their croup is safe to treat at home.\nYou should not try to check your child&#8217;s throat yourself. It could trigger a spasm (sudden narrowing) of the airway. This could make breathing even more difficult.\nMost cases of croup are mild and can be treated at home.\nSitting your child upright and comforting them if they are distressed is important. This is because crying may make symptoms worse. Your child should also drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration.\nUsually, your child will be prescribed medication to help reduce the swelling in their throat. The medication is a single dose of an oral corticosteroid called dexamethasone or prednisolone. Side effects of these medications can include restlessness, vomiting, upset stomach and headache.\nSteam treatment is not recommended.\nYou should seek urgent medical advice if you notice your child’s symptoms getting worse.\nChildren&#8217;s paracetamol can ease pain and may help lower your child&#8217;s temperature if they have a fever.\nChildren under 16 years of age should not be given aspirin.\nSpeak to your pharmacist or GP if you are unsure about what type of pain relief is right for your child.\nDo not use cough medicines or decongestants. These do not help ease the symptoms of croup. These treatments often have drowsy side effects, which can be dangerous when a child has breathing difficulties.\nIn severe cases of croup, treatment in hospital may be needed. This might include your child being given adrenaline or oxygen.\nCommonly, croup is caused by a virus. Several viruses can cause croup but in most cases it is the parainfluenza virus.\nThe virus can be passed on by close contact with infected people, as well as contaminated objects and surfaces. It&#8217;s often spread by breathing in droplets from infected coughs or sneezes.\nOther viruses can also cause croup. These include:\n- influenza A and B (flu viruses)\n- the measles virus, in children who have not been immunised against measles\n- the rhinovirus (common cold virus)\n- enteroviruses\n- the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which can cause severe breathing problems and pneumonia in babies\nLess common causes of croup include:\n- breathing in a small object such as a peanut or a pen cap (inhaled foreign body)\n- inflammation of the epiglottis (the flap at the base of the tongue that keeps food from going into the windpipe)\n- a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), for example to certain foods\n- breathing in irritants such as chemicals\n- acid leaking back out of the stomach and into the throat (acid reflux)"

        "disease": "Cystic fibrosis",
        "description": "Cystic fibrosis is an inherited condition in which the lungs and digestive system can become clogged with thick, sticky mucus.\nIt&nbsp;can cause problems with breathing and digestion from a young age. Over many years, the lungs become increasingly damaged and may eventually stop working properly.\nMost cases of cystic fibrosis in the UK are now identified through screening tests carried out soon after birth. It&#8217;s estimated that 1 in every 2,500 babies born in the UK&nbsp;has cystic fibrosis.\nA number of treatments are available to help reduce the problems caused by the condition,&nbsp;but unfortunately average&nbsp;life expectancy is reduced for people who have it.\nSymptoms of cystic fibrosis tend to start in early childhood, although they can sometimes develop very&nbsp;soon after birth, or may not be obvious until adulthood.\nSome of the main symptoms of cystic fibrosis can include:\n- recurring&nbsp;chest infections\n- difficulty putting on weight\n- frequent, wet-sounding&nbsp;coughs\n- diarrhoea\n- occasional wheezing and&nbsp;shortness of breath\nPeople with the condition can also develop a number of related conditions, including diabetes,&nbsp;thin, weakened bones (osteoporosis) and liver problems.\nRead more about the symptoms of cystic fibrosis\nCystic fibrosis is caused by a faulty gene that a child inherits from both of their parents.\nThe faulty gene means that some cells struggle to move salt and water across the cell wall. This, along with recurrent infections, can result in a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the body&#8217;s tubes and passageways.\nTo be born with cystic fibrosis, a child has to inherit two copies of this faulty gene – one from each of their parents. Their parents will not usually have the condition themselves, because they will only carry one faulty gene and one that works normally.\nIf both parents carry the faulty gene, there&#8217;s a 25% chance that each child they have will be born with cystic fibrosis.\nRead more about the causes of cystic fibrosis\nMost cases of cystic fibrosis are now detected soon after birth through the&nbsp;newborn blood spot test.\nThis involves collecting a drop of blood from the baby&#8217;s heel and testing it for&nbsp;abnormalities that could indicate cystic fibrosis.\nMore tests&nbsp;will be needed to confirm the diagnosis, such as:\n- a sweat test – to measure the amount of salt in sweat, as the sweat of someone with cystic fibrosis has higher levels of salt than normal\n- a genetic test – where a sample of blood or saliva is checked for the faulty gene that causes cystic fibrosis\nThese tests can also be carried out in older children and adults with symptoms of cystic fibrosis who haven&#8217;t been screened previously.\nIf you have a family history of cystic fibrosis, you can be tested to determine if you&#8217;re at risk of having a child with the condition by checking if you&#8217;re a&nbsp;&#8220;carrier&#8221; of the faulty gene that causes it.\nRead more about how cystic fibrosis is diagnosed\nThere&#8217;s currently no cure for cystic fibrosis, but a number of treatments are available to help control the symptoms, prevent&nbsp;complications, and make the condition easier to live with.\nPossible treatments include:\n- antibiotics&nbsp;to prevent and treat&nbsp;chest infections\n- medicines&nbsp;to&nbsp;make the mucus in the lungs thinner and easier to cough up\n- medicines to widen the airways and reduce inflammation\n- special techniques and devices to help clear mucus from the lungs\n- medicines that help the person absorb food better\n- following a special diet and taking supplements to prevent malnutrition\nA&nbsp;lung transplant may eventually be needed if the lungs become greatly damaged.\nRead more about treating cystic fibrosis\nCystic fibrosis is a progressive condition, which means it tends to get worse over time.\nEventually the condition can be fatal if it leads to a serious infection or the lungs stop working properly.\nThe outlook for cystic fibrosis has improved considerably in recent years&nbsp;because of&nbsp;advancements in treatment, although most people with cystic fibrosis will have a shorter-than-average life expectancy.\nCurrently, about half of the people with cystic fibrosis will live past the age of 40. Children born with the condition nowadays are likely to live longer than this.\nCystic fibrosis can cause a range of problems. The lungs and digestive system are the main areas that are affected.\nSymptoms tend to start in early childhood,&nbsp;but sometimes they can develop soon after birth&nbsp;and very occasionally&nbsp;they may not be obvious until adulthood.\nNowadays, cystic fibrosis is usually&nbsp;diagnosed before symptoms appear, through screening tests carried out soon after birth. Read more about screening for&nbsp;cystic fibrosis.\nThe main problems associated with cystic fibrosis are outlined below.\nCystic fibrosis can cause sticky mucus to clog the lungs and airways. This can cause:\n- recurring chest infections&nbsp;– these occur because mucus in the lungs is an ideal breeding ground for bacteria\n- persistent inflammation of the airways, which can cause them to become abnormally widened (bronchiectasis)\n- increased&nbsp;coughing\n- occasional wheezing and&nbsp;shortness of breath\nOver time, the lungs can become increasingly damaged and may eventually stop working properly.\nThe mucus can also block parts of the digestive system, which&nbsp;can affect how food travels through the gut and how it&#8217;s&nbsp;broken down or absorbed.\nThis can cause:\n- a serious bowel obstruction&nbsp;in the first few days of life (meconium ileus)&nbsp;–&nbsp;this will often need an operation to remove the blockage\n- jaundice\n- diarrhoea or large, smelly stools\n- problems putting on weight and growing&nbsp;– this can occur because the body&nbsp;struggles to&nbsp;digest and absorb nutrients (malnutrition)\n- diabetes from late childhood or early adulthood&nbsp;– this can develop if the pancreas becomes severely damaged\nPeople with cystic fibrosis can also&nbsp;experience a number of other problems, including:\n- sinusitis\n- nasal polyps\n- thin,&nbsp;weakened bones (osteoporosis)&nbsp;–&nbsp;this can occur as a result of repeated infections, poor growth, lack of physical activity and malnutrition\n- swelling and pain in the joints (arthritis or arthralgia) from late childhood\n- difficulty conceiving children – most men with cystic fibrosis are unable to have children naturally (although some fertility treatments may still work) because the tubes that carry sperm don&#8217;t develop correctly; women can become pregnant, however\n- liver problems caused by&nbsp;the tiny bile ducts in the liver becoming blocked by mucus\n- leaking of small amounts of urine, particularly during coughing fits (stress incontinence)\nCystic fibrosis is caused by a faulty gene that a child inherits from both their parents.\nThe faulty gene means that some cells struggle to move salt and water across the cell wall. This, along with recurrent infections, can result in a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the body&#8217;s tubes and passageways – particularly the lungs and digestive system.\nThe condition is present from birth and cannot be caught from someone else who has it.\nGenes come in pairs. You inherit one set from your mother and one set from your father.\nTo be born with cystic fibrosis, a child has to inherit a copy of the faulty gene from both of their parents.\nThis can happen if&nbsp;the parents are &#8216;carriers&#8217; of the faulty gene. This means they don&#8217;t have cystic fibrosis themselves, but they can have a child with the condition if their partner also carries the faulty gene.\nIt&#8217;s estimated that around 1 in every 25 people in the UK are carriers of the faulty gene that causes cystic fibrosis.\nIf both parents are carriers, there&#8217;s a:\n- 25% chance that each child they have will not inherit any faulty genes and won&#8217;t have&nbsp;cystic fibrosis&nbsp;or be able to pass it on\n- 50% chance that each child they have will just inherit one copy of the faulty gene from one parent and be a carrier\n- 25% chance that each child they have will inherit copies of the faulty gene from both parents and will have&nbsp;cystic fibrosis&nbsp;\nThis is known as an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.\nTests can be carried out to diagnose cystic fibrosis at any age.\nMost cases are now detected soon after birth through newborn screening, but older children and adults with symptoms of cystic fibrosis who weren&#8217;t screened can also have tests to check for the condition.\nTests to find out if you are a &#8216;carrier&#8217; of the faulty gene responsible for&nbsp;cystic fibrosis&nbsp;may also be recommended for some people.\nA&nbsp;newborn blood spot test is offered to all babies in Scotland to help detect problems early on, including cystic fibrosis.\nWhen your baby is five to eight days old, a health professional will prick their heel and collect drops of blood on a special card. The blood is then sent to a laboratory to be checked for abnormalities that could indicate cystic fibrosis.\nYou should receive the results by the time your baby is six to eight weeks old. You will be contacted sooner if a problem is found, and you&#8217;ll be asked to attend a hospital appointment.\nThe screening result isn&#8217;t 100% accurate, so more tests will be carried out to confirm the diagnosis. You, your partner and any other children you have may also be tested to see if you carry the faulty gene that causes cystic fibrosis.\nTests to confirm a diagnosis will be carried out if screening suggests that your child may have cystic fibrosis, or your doctor thinks you could have the condition and you haven&#8217;t been screened previously.\nTwo main tests can be used to diagnose cystic fibrosis:\n- sweat test – a test to measure the amount of salt in sweat, as the sweat of someone with cystic fibrosis has higher levels of salt than normal\n- genetic test – where a sample of blood or saliva is checked for the faulty gene that causes cystic fibrosis\nThe sweat test is most commonly used, although&nbsp;genetic testing may be done if the sweat test result is inconclusive or to identify the specific genetic fault that&#8217;s causing the condition.\nTesting to&nbsp;find out if you carry the faulty gene that causes cystic fibrosis may be useful if:\n- you&nbsp;have a close relative, such as a child, sibling or parent,&nbsp;who&#8217;s a known carrier\n- you&nbsp;have a close relative&nbsp;with cystic fibrosis\n- your partner is known to carry the&nbsp;cystic fibrosis gene\nThis can be done using a blood test, or occasionally a special mouthwash, to collect a sample of cells. The sample is then sent to a laboratory so it can be checked for the faulty gene.\nFinding out whether you&#8217;re a carrier of the faulty gene can help determine if you&#8217;re at risk of having a child with cystic fibrosis.&nbsp;A genetic counsellor&nbsp;will explain the results of the test&nbsp;to you and discuss the implications and options available for&nbsp;future pregnancies.\nThere&#8217;s currently no cure for cystic fibrosis, but it&#8217;s possible to help control the symptoms, prevent or reduce complications, and make the condition easier to live with.\nA person with cystic fibrosis will be supported by a&nbsp;team of healthcare professionals at a specialist cystic fibrosis centre. A care plan will be drawn up that&#8217;s tailored to their individual needs.\nA range of treatments may be&nbsp;used and sometimes treatment in hospital will be needed. Regular appointments to monitor the condition will also be recommended.\nSome of the main treatments for cystic fibrosis include:\nPeople with cystic fibrosis may need to take a number of different medicines to treat and prevent lung problems. These may be swallowed, inhaled or injected.\nSome of the main medicines for cystic fibrosis are:\n- antibiotics to prevent and treat&nbsp;chest infections\n- medicines to make the sticky mucus in the lungs thinner, such as dornase alfa, hypertonic saline and mannitol dry powder\n- a medicine called ivacaftor to help reduce the levels of mucus in the body – although this is only suitable for fewer than 1 in every 20 people (4%) with cystic fibrosis\n- bronchodilators to widen the airways and help make breathing easier\n- steroid medication to treat&nbsp;nasal polyps&nbsp;(small growths inside the nose)\nIt&#8217;s also&nbsp;important that people with cystic fibrosis are up to date with all routine vaccinations and have the&nbsp;flu jab&nbsp;each year once they&#8217;re old enough.\nIn addition to medication, special techniques can be used to help keep the lungs and airways clear. A physiotherapist&nbsp;can give you advice.\nSome of the main techniques include:\n- active cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT) – a technique that involves a sequence of relaxed breathing, followed by deep breathing exercises and then huffing\n- autogenic drainage – a series of gentle breathing techniques that clear mucus from the lungs\n- modified postural drainage – a technique that involves changing your position to make it easier to remove mucus from your lungs\n- airway clearance devices – handheld devices that use vibration and air pressure to help remove mucus from your airways; you may have to pay in the region of £45-60 for one of these devices\nYour care team can provide more information on the techniques mentioned above.&nbsp;\nFor people with cystic fibrosis, getting the right nutrition is vital in helping them develop normally and stopping them becoming frequently ill.\nHowever, the majority of people with cystic fibrosis cannot digest food and absorb nutrients from when they&#8217;re a baby. Occasionally, the condition can cause the pancreas to become damaged over time, causing the same problem.\nA dietitian will advise on what you can do to help avoid malnutrition. They may recommend:\n- taking digestive enzyme capsules with all meals and snacks to help with digestion – the number of capsules needed depends on the food being eaten and varies from person to person\n- following a special balanced diet that&#8217;s high in calories (energy), fat and protein\n- taking&nbsp;vitamin and mineral supplements\nIn severe cases of cystic fibrosis, when the lungs stop working properly and all medical treatments have failed to help, a lung transplant may be recommended.\nA lung transplant is a serious operation that carries risks, but it can greatly improve the length and quality of life for people with severe cystic fibrosis.\nThe outlook for people with cystic fibrosis is often better than for many transplant patients, as they&#8217;re often younger and in better general health. It&#8217;s&nbsp;estimated that up to 9 out of 10 people will survive for at least a year after a transplant.\nThe Cystic Fibrosis Trust has information on lung transplants in cystic fibrosis.\nPeople with cystic fibrosis can have a number of other problems that may benefit from treatment.\nFor example:\n- exercise can help keep bones and joints healthy, and is recommended for everyone with&nbsp;cystic fibrosis&nbsp;–&nbsp;any sport or exercise is usually good, but if you&#8217;re not sure about a particular activity, you should ask your physiotherapist for advice\n- medicines called bisphosphonates can help treat weak and brittle bones that may occur as a result of cystic fibrosis if the person doesn&#8217;t get enough&nbsp;vitaminD and calcium&nbsp;(from their diet and/or from supplements)\n- insulin medication and a special diet may help someone with diabetes caused by&nbsp;cystic fibrosis control their blood sugar levels"

        "description": "Cystitis is inflammation of the bladder, usually caused by a bladder infection.\nIt&#8217;s a&nbsp;common type of&nbsp;urinary tract infection (UTI), particularly in women, and is usually more of a nuisance than a cause for serious concern. Mild cases will often get better by themselves within a few days.\nHowever, some people experience episodes of cystitis frequently and may need regular or long-term treatment.\nThere&#8217;s also a chance that cystitis&nbsp;could lead to a more serious&nbsp;kidney infection&nbsp;in some cases, so it&#8217;s important to seek professional advice if&nbsp;your symptoms don&#8217;t improve.\nThe main symptoms of cystitis include:\n- pain, burning or stinging when you pee\n- needing to pee more often and urgently than normal\n- urine that&#8217;s dark, cloudy or strong smelling\n- pain low down in your tummy\n- feeling generally unwell, achy, sick and tired\nPossible symptoms in young children include a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above, weakness, irritability, reduced appetite and vomiting.\nRead more about the&nbsp;symptoms of cystitis\nSpeak to your pharmacist if you think you may have cystitis or symptoms of a urine infection. Women who have had cystitis before don&#8217;t necessarily need to see their GP if the condition returns, as&nbsp;mild cases often get better without treatment. You can try the&nbsp;self-help measures, or ask your pharmacist for advice.\nWomen over 16 with symptoms of a mild urinary infection can get advice and treatment directly from their pharmacist through the Pharmacy First Scotland service. Your pharmacist may be able to provide you with treatment to clear the infection, although there may be situations where they will recommend you see your GP. Find your local pharmacy on Scotland&#8217;s Service directory.\nYou should see your GP if:\n- your symptoms&nbsp;don&#8217;t start to improve within a few days\n- you get cystitis frequently\n- you have severe symptoms, such as&nbsp;blood in your urine\n- you&#8217;re pregnant and have symptoms of cystitis\n- you&#8217;re a man and have symptoms of cystitis\n- your child has symptoms of cystitis\nYour GP should be able to diagnose the problem by asking about your symptoms. They may test a sample of your urine for bacteria to help confirm the diagnosis.\nMost cases are thought to&nbsp;occur when bacteria that live harmlessly in the bowel or on the skin get into the bladder through the urethra (tube that carries urine out of your body).\nIt&#8217;s not always clear how this happens, but it&nbsp;can be caused by:\n- having sex\n- wiping your bottom after&nbsp;going to the toilet&nbsp;– particularly if you wipe from back to front\n- inserting a tampon or&nbsp;urinary catheter (a thin tube inserted into the urethra to drain the bladder)\n- using a&nbsp;diaphragm for contraception\nWomen may get cystitis more often than men because their anus (back passage) is closer to their urethra, and their urethra is much shorter, which means bacteria&nbsp;may be able to&nbsp;get into the bladder more easily.\nRead more about the causes of cystitis\nIf you see your pharmacist with symptoms of cystitis you can be treated under the Pharmacy First Scotland service. If you are female over 16 with signs of a mild urine infection, the pharmacist may offer you a course of antibiotics&nbsp;to treat the infection where appropriate. These should start to have an effect within a day or two.\nIf you&#8217;ve had cystitis before and don&#8217;t feel you need to see your pharmacist or GP, you may want to treat your symptoms at home.\nUntil you&#8217;re feeling better, it may help to:\n- take&nbsp;paracetamol or&nbsp;ibuprofen\n- drink plenty of water\n- hold a hot water bottle on your tummy or between your thighs\n- avoid having sex\nSome people find it helpful to try over-the-counter&nbsp;products that reduce the acidity of their urine (such as sodium bicarbonate or potassium citrate), but there&#8217;s a lack of evidence to suggest they&#8217;re effective.\nIf you keep getting cystitis, your GP may give you an antibiotic prescription to take to a pharmacy whenever you develop symptoms, without needing to see your&nbsp;doctor first. Your GP can also prescribe a low dose of antibiotics for you to take continuously over several months if necessary.\nRead more about treating cystitis\nIf you get cystitis frequently, there are some things you can try that may stop it coming back. However, it&#8217;s not clear how effective most of these measures are.\nThese measures include:\n- not using perfumed bubble bath, soap or talcum powder around your genitals – use plain, unperfumed varieties\n- having a shower, rather than a bath – this&nbsp;avoids exposing your genitals to the chemicals in your cleaning products for too long\n- going to the toilet as soon as you need to pee and&nbsp;always emptying your bladder fully\n- staying well hydrated –&nbsp;drinking plenty of fluids may help to stop bacteria&nbsp;multiplying in your bladder&nbsp;\n- always wiping your bottom from front to back when you go to the toilet\n- emptying your bladder as soon as possible after having sex\n- wearing underwear made from cotton, rather than synthetic material such as nylon, and&nbsp;not wearing tight jeans and trousers\nDrinking cranberry juice has traditionally been recommended as a way of&nbsp;reducing your chances of getting cystitis. However,&nbsp;large studies have suggested it doesn&#8217;t make a significant difference.\nCystitis can cause problems with peeing and make you feel unwell.\nCystitis in adults can cause:\n- pain, burning or stinging&nbsp;when you pee\n- needing to pee more often and urgently than normal\n- feeling like you need to pee again&nbsp;soon after going to the toilet\n- urine that&#8217;s dark, cloudy or strong-smelling\n- pain low down in your tummy\n- feeling generally unwell, achy, sick and tired\n- blood in your urine\nIn adults, cystitis doesn&#8217;t usually cause a high temperature (fever). If you have a temperature&nbsp;of 38C (100.4F) or above and pain in your lower back or sides, it may be a sign of a kidney infection.\nIt can be difficult to tell whether a child has cystitis, because the symptoms can be vague and young children cannot easily communicate how they feel.\nPossible symptoms of cystitis in young children may include:\n- a&nbsp;high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above\n- weakness and tiredness\n- irritability&nbsp;\n- reduced appetite\n- vomiting\nChildren&nbsp;with cystitis can sometimes also have symptoms usually found in adults, such as&nbsp;pain when&nbsp;peeing, peeing more often than normal and pain in their tummy.\nYou should see your GP if you or your child have symptoms of cystitis for the first time.\nCystitis isn&#8217;t usually a cause for serious concern, but the&nbsp;symptoms can&nbsp;be similar to several other conditions, so&nbsp;it&#8217;s important to get a proper diagnosis.\nIf you&#8217;re a woman who has had cystitis before, you don&#8217;t necessarily need to see your GP again. Cystitis is very common in women and mild cases often get better on their own. Speak to a pharmacist if you need any advice about treating cystitis.\nHowever, you should see your GP if your symptoms are severe or don&#8217;t start to get better in a few days, you get cystitis frequently,&nbsp;or you&#8217;re pregnant.\nChildren and men should always be seen by a GP if they&nbsp;have symptoms of cystitis, as the condition is less common and could be more serious in these groups.\nCystitis is usually caused by a bacterial infection, although it sometimes happens when the bladder is irritated or damaged for another reason.\nMost&nbsp;infections are thought to&nbsp;occur when bacteria that live harmlessly in the bowel or on the skin get into the bladder through the urethra (tube that carries urine out of your body) and start to multiply.\nCystitis is much more common in women than men, probably because the anus (back passage) is closer to the urethra in women and the urethra is much shorter.\nIt&#8217;s not always obvious how the bacteria get into the bladder, but it can be caused by:\n- having sex\n- wiping your bottom after&nbsp;going to the toilet&nbsp;– particularly if you wipe from back to front\n- inserting a tampon or&nbsp;urinary catheter (a thin tube inserted into the urethra to drain the bladder)\n- using a&nbsp;diaphragm for contraception\nThere are a number of things that can increase your chances of developing an infection in your bladder.\nIf you&#8217;re unable to empty your bladder fully, any bacteria that get inside may not be flushed out when you&nbsp;go to the toilet&nbsp;and can multiply more easily.\nYou may not be able to empty your bladder fully if:\n- you have a blockage in your urinary system, such as a bladder stone\n- you&#8217;re pregnant, as the&nbsp;baby may be pressing on your bladder\n- (in men) you have an&nbsp;enlarged prostate gland that presses on the urethra\nFor women who&nbsp;have been through the&nbsp;menopause, or are going through it, the lining of the urethra can shrink and become thinner because of&nbsp;a lack of the hormone oestrogen.\nThe natural balance of bacteria in the vagina&nbsp;may also change, which can allow potentially harmful bacteria to become more common.\nThis&nbsp;can make the urethra more vulnerable to infection, which could spread into the bladder.\nYou&#8217;re more likely to get cystitis if you have&nbsp;diabetes – a condition where the level of sugar in your body becomes too high.\nHigh levels of sugar in your urine can provide a good environment for bacteria to multiply, so any bacteria that get into the bladder are more likely to cause cystitis.\nCystitis can also be caused by damage or irritation to the urethra and bladder.\nThis can be the result of:\n- friction from sex\n- chemical irritants, such as those in perfumed soap or bubble bath\n- damage caused by a&nbsp;catheter or surgery on your bladder\n- radiotherapy to your pelvis or treatment with certain chemotherapy medicines\n- a&nbsp;woman&#8217;s genitals&nbsp;having been&nbsp;deliberately cut or changed for cultural, religious and social reasons (an illegal practice called female genital mutilation or FGM)\nCystitis has also been linked to recreational use of the drug ketamine.\nMild cystitis will usually clear up on its own within a few days, although sometimes you may need to take antibiotics.\nSee your GP for advice and treatment if:\n- you have&nbsp;symptoms of cystitis&nbsp;for the first time\n- your symptoms&nbsp;don&#8217;t start to improve within a few days\n- you get cystitis frequently\n- you have severe symptoms, such as blood in your urine\n- you&#8217;re pregnant and have symptoms of cystitis\n- you&#8217;re a man and have symptoms of cystitis\n- your child has symptoms of cystitis\nWomen who have had cystitis before don&#8217;t necessarily need to see their GP if the condition returns, as&nbsp;mild cases often&nbsp;get better without antibiotics. You can try the self-help measures or ask your pharmacist for advice.\nIf you&#8217;ve had cystitis before and don&#8217;t&nbsp;feel you need to see your GP, the following advice may help to relieve your symptoms until the condition clears up:\n- take over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen&nbsp;–&nbsp;always read the medicine information leaflet beforehand to check whether you can take it, and check with your pharmacist if you&#8217;re not sure\n- drink plenty of water – it&#8217;s been suggested this may help flush the infection out of your bladder and some people find it helpful, although it&#8217;s not clear how effective it actually is\n- use a hot water bottle – holding a hot water bottle on your tummy or between your thighs may reduce any discomfort\n- don&#8217;t have sex until you&#8217;re feeling better, because&nbsp;it may make the condition worse\nSome people find drinking cranberry juice or using products that reduce the acidity of their urine (such as sodium bicarbonate or potassium citrate) reduce their symptoms, but there&#8217;s a lack of evidence to suggest they&#8217;re effective.\nThese products are also not suitable for everyone. Check with your GP or pharmacist before trying them&nbsp;if you&#8217;re taking any other medication.\nIn some cases, your GP may prescribe a&nbsp;course of antibiotics. This will usually involve taking a tablet&nbsp;or capsule 2 to&nbsp;4 times a day for 3 days.\nAntibiotics should start to have an effect quite quickly. Return to your GP if your symptoms haven&#8217;t started to improve within a few days.\nMost people won&#8217;t have any side effects from antibiotic treatment, but possible side effects can include feeling or being sick, itching, a rash and diarrhoea.\nIf you keep getting cystitis (known as recurrent&nbsp;cystitis) your doctor may prescribe stand-by antibiotics or continuous antibiotics.\nA stand-by antibiotic is a prescription you can take to&nbsp;a pharmacy the next time you have symptoms of&nbsp;cystitis, without needing to visit your GP first.\nContinuous antibiotics are taken for several months to prevent further episodes of cystitis. These may be prescribed:\n- if cystitis usually occurs after having sex – you may be given a prescription for antibiotics to take within 2 hours of having sex\n- if cystitis is not related to having sex – you may be given a low-dose antibiotic to take for a trial period of 6 months\nYour doctor may also recommend some measures you can take to prevent cystitis, although it&#8217;s not clear how effective these are."

The condition can either be present at birth or develop later in life.\nDeafblindness from birth is known as congenital deafblindness.\nIt can be caused by:\n- problems associated with&nbsp;premature birth (birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy)\n- an infection picked up during pregnancy, such as&nbsp;rubella (German measles),&nbsp;toxoplasmosis or&nbsp;cytomegalovirus (CMV)\n- genetic conditions, such as&nbsp;CHARGE syndrome&nbsp;or Down&#8217;s syndrome\n- cerebral palsy&nbsp;–&nbsp;a problem with the brain and nervous system that mainly affects movement and co-ordination\n- foetal alcohol syndrome&nbsp;–&nbsp;health problems caused by drinking alcohol in pregnancy\nIn most cases, deafblindness develops later in life. This is known as acquired deafblindness.\nA person&nbsp;with acquired deafblindness&nbsp;may be&nbsp;born without a hearing or sight&nbsp;problem and then later loses part or all of both senses. Alternatively, someone may be born with either a hearing or vision problem,&nbsp;and then later loses part or all of the other sense later on.\nProblems that can&nbsp;contribute to&nbsp;acquired deafblindness include:\n- age-related&nbsp;hearing loss\n- Usher syndrome – a genetic condition that affects hearing, vision and balance\n- eye problems associated with&nbsp;increasing age, such as&nbsp;age-related macular degeneration (AMD),&nbsp;cataracts and&nbsp;glaucoma\n- diabetic retinopathy&nbsp;– a complication of diabetes where the cells&nbsp;lining the back of the eye&nbsp;are damaged by high blood sugar levels\n- damage to the brain, such as from meningitis, encephalitis, a&nbsp;stroke or&nbsp;severe head injury\nSense has further information about the causes of deafblindness.\nDeafblindness may be detected soon after a baby is born, or after tests carried out later in life.\nSpeak to your GP if you have any concerns about your or your child&#8217;s hearing and/or vision at any point.\nIf you&#8217;re worried about a family member or friend, try to encourage them to speak to their GP.\nIf&nbsp;your baby is born deafblind, this will usually be picked up during newborn screening.\nThese are a series of checks carried out to&nbsp;see if your baby has any serious health problems from birth, including any problems with their eyes or hearing.\nIf no problems are picked up at this stage, they may be detected during routine checks as your child gets older.\nIn most cases, deafblindness&nbsp;develops as a person gets older. It can happen gradually, so you may not notice that your vision and/or hearing are getting worse at first.\nIt&#8217;s therefore important to have routine eye tests to check for any problems. Adults should normally have their eyes tested every two years.\nYou can request a hearing test at your GP surgery at any point if you think you may be losing your hearing.\nA person&nbsp;may be diagnosed with deafblindness if&nbsp;tests show they have&nbsp;both hearing and vision problems.\nTheir&nbsp;hearing and vision should continue to be regularly assessed&nbsp;even after they&#8217;ve been diagnosed, as the level of care and support&nbsp;they need will depend on how severely each sense is affected.\nAs soon as deafblindness has been identified, a specialist assessment should be arranged by&nbsp;the local authority.\nThe assessment&nbsp;should only be carried out by a specially trained professional who&nbsp;is able to identify the deafblind person&#8217;s abilities and&nbsp;needs.&nbsp;The assessment should include assessing their&nbsp;needs in relation to:\n- communication\n- one-to-one human contact\n- social interaction\n- emotional wellbeing\n- support with mobility\n- assistive technology\n- rehabilitation\nThe assessment will also take&nbsp;into account the person&#8217;s current needs and those that develop in the future.\nA deafblind person should have access to services suitable to their level of hearing and sight and their individual needs. Mainstream services aimed mainly at blind or deaf people may not always be appropriate.\nRead more about the treatments and services available for deafblind people.\nIt&#8217;s not always possible to treat the underlying causes of deafblindness, but a range of care and support services is available to help people with the condition.\nMost deafblind people will still have some hearing and/or vision. The level of care and support they need will depend on&nbsp;how severe their hearing and vision problems are.\nThe individual abilities and needs of a deafblind person should be assessed soon after they&#8217;re diagnosed. This will allow a tailored care plan to be drawn up.\nThe care plan will aim to:\n- preserve and maximise any remaining sensory functions the person has\n- teach alternative communication methods such as the deafblind manual alphabet (see below)\n- help the person retain as much independence as possible – for example, by recommending they receive training to use a long cane or guide dog or through the provision of a communicator guide\n- for young children,&nbsp;ensure their educational needs are met\nRead further information\n- Sense:&nbsp;Benefits and money\n- Sense:&nbsp;Support for disabled children and young people\nAs deafblindness can make communicating by speech and writing difficult, alternative forms of communication may be necessary.\nThe main communication systems&nbsp;used by deafblind people include:\n- clear speech – speaking clearly is one of the most effective and common ways of communicating with deafblind people who have some remaining vision and hearing\n- deafblind manual alphabet –&nbsp;a tactile form of communication where words are spelt onto the deafblind person&#8217;s hand using set positions and movements\n- block alphabet – a simple tactile form of communication where a word is spelt out in capital letters that are drawn onto the deafblind person&#8217;s palm\n- hands-on signing – an adapted version of British Sign Language (BSL)&nbsp;where&nbsp;the deafblind person feels what&#8217;s being signed by placing their hands on top of the signer&#8217;s hand\n- visual frame signing – an adapted version of BSL where&nbsp;the signs are adapted to be signed in a smaller space to match the position and size of a deafblind person&#8217;s remaining sight\n- braille – a system that uses&nbsp;a series of raised dots to represent letters or groups of letters\n- moon –&nbsp;similar to Braille, but uses raised, adapted capital letters that are simpler to feel\nRead further information:\n- Sense:&nbsp;Ways of communicating\nFor some&nbsp;deafblind people, it may be possible to improve vision using low vision aids, such as glasses, magnifying lenses and task lights.\nSpecially designed items, such as telephones and keyboards, may also help someone who is visually impaired.\nThe&nbsp;Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB)&nbsp;has more information about everyday living with vision loss,&nbsp;including advice about the technology available&nbsp;to help with everyday tasks.\nMany libraries stock a selection of large-print books and &#8216;talking books&#8217;, where the text is read aloud and recorded onto a CD. The RNIB also offer a talking book subscription service, where books can be ordered and delivered directly to your home for a small annual fee.\nRead further information:\n- RNIB: Assistive aids and technology\nSome deafblind people may benefit from wearing a&nbsp;hearing aid. There are various hearing aid styles available to suit different types of hearing loss and personal preference.\nHearing aids use microphones to collect the sound from the environment, amplify it and deliver it into the ear canal of the wearer so that it can be processed by the auditory system. An audiologist (hearing specialist) will be able to recommend the most suitable type of aid after testing your hearing.\nFor some people, hearing aids that deliver the sound into the ear canal are not appropriate. In these cases, hearing may be improved using a surgically implanted hearing system, such as a cochlea implant or bone conducting hearing implant.\nWhile these still use a microphone to collect the sound initially, they then covert that sound into either an electrical signal or vibration, passing it to the inner or middle ear for processing by the auditory system.\n- Sense:&nbsp;Assistive technology for people with hearing loss\n- RNID: Hearing aids\nEvery deafblind person is entitled to help from a&nbsp;specially trained one-to-one support worker if they need it.\nDepending on the person&#8217;s situation, this may be a:\n- communicator guide –&nbsp;someone who works with people who have become deafblind later in life, to offer the support the person needs to live independently\n- interpreter –&nbsp;someone who acts as a communication link between the deafblind person and other people, using the deafblind person&#8217;s preferred method of communication\n- intervenor –&nbsp;someone who&nbsp;works with&nbsp;children and adults who were born deafblind, to help them experience and join in the world around them as much as possible\nSome conditions that affect hearing and vision can be treated using medication or surgery. For example:\n- cataracts&nbsp;can often be treated by surgically implanting an artificial lens in the eye\n- glaucoma&nbsp;can often be treated using eye drops&nbsp;or laser surgery – read more about treating glaucoma\n- diabetic retinopathy can be treated in the early stages using laser surgery\nSome&nbsp;causes of temporary hearing loss are also treatable, such as a&nbsp;build-up of earwax or middle ear infections."

        "disease": "Deep vein thrombosis",
        "description": "Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot that develops within a vein, usually in the leg. Each year, DVT affects around 1 person in every 1000 in the UK.\nSwelling is one of the main symptoms of DVT. It may not always be easy to notice. Swelling can happen in any part of your leg, but usually happens in the back of the leg.\nOther symptoms of DVT include:\n- tenderness\n- throbbing pain – if the clot is in your leg, pain is usually in the calf or thigh when walking or standing up, and pain may be worse when you bend your foot upwards towards your knee\n- a heavy ache in the affected area\n- red or darkened skin around the painful area – depending on your skin tone this may be difficult to see\n- warm skin around the painful area\n- swollen veins that are hard or sore when you touch them\nThese symptoms can also happen in your arm or tummy if that&#8217;s where the blood clot is.\nYou have symptoms of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), like pain and swelling, as well as:\nDo not drive yourself to A&amp;E. Ask someone to take you to A&amp;E or phone 999 for an ambulance.Bring any medicines you take with you.\nAnyone can develop DVT, but the risk increases with age. You&#8217;re also more likely to get DVT if you:\n- are inactive for long periods – for example, after an operation or during a long journey\n- have had DVT, a pulmonary embolism or a blood clot before\n- have a family history of DVT, pulmonary embolism or blood clots\n- you have damaged blood vessels – for example, due to injury or a condition like varicose veins\n- are pregnant or have given birth in the last 6 weeks\n- take the contraceptive pill or hormone replacement therapy (HRT)\n- are receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy\n- have cancer\n- have heart or lung disease\n- smoke\n- are overweight or obese\nSometimes DVT can happen for no obvious reason.\nIf your doctor thinks that you have DVT, you will need to have some tests. These include a specific blood test called a D dimer, and/or an ultrasound. An ultrasound scan shows if blood is flowing normally through the veins or if there are any clots.\nYou may also need an X-ray of the vein (venogram). For this, you&#8217;ll be injected with a dye to show where the clot is.\nThere are a few ways to treat DVT. Your healthcare team will decide the best way to treat your symptoms.\nAnticoagulant medicines are used to treat DVT. These can include warfarin or apixaban.\nAnticoagulants are often referred to as &#8220;blood-thinning&#8221; medicines, but they don&#8217;t actually thin the blood. They alter proteins within it, which prevents clots forming so easily.\nYou may need to take an anticoagulant medicine like warfarin for at least 3 months.\nYou&#8217;ll be prescribed compression socks to treat DVT. These are knee-high elastic socks that help your blood circulation.\nCompression socks can improve the symptoms of DVT, including pain and swelling. They can also help to prevent complications of DVT.\nOnce you&#8217;ve been prescribed compression socks, your healthcare team may advise you to walk regularly. This can help to prevent symptoms of DVT and reduce or prevent complications.\nSome people may need surgery to treat DVT.\nYou may need to be fitted with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter to treat your symptoms. These are small mesh devices that can be placed in a vein. They can be used to help prevent blood clots developing.\nIf you have DVT in your leg, you may be advised to raise it whenever you&#8217;re resting. This helps to relieve pressure in the veins of the calf and stops blood and fluid pooling in the calf.\nWhen raising your leg, make sure your foot is higher than your hip. To do this, you can put a cushion underneath your leg whilst you&#8217;re lying down.\nYou can help reduce your risk of getting DVT by making changes to your lifestyle.\nFind out more about healthy living\nIf you need to go into hospital for surgery, your healthcare team will assess your risk of developing DVT.\nIf you&#8217;re at risk of developing DVT, you may be given treatment to prevent it. For example, you may need to wear compression socks or take medicine.\nYou may need to continue these treatments after you leave hospital as there&#8217;s still a risk that you could develop DVT.\nWhilst in hospital, try to move as much as you can. Your healthcare team may give you exercises to do.\nIf you need to travel a long distance, or for more than 3 hours, there are steps you can take to help avoid getting DVT.\nYou should:\n- drink plenty of water\n- practice some leg exercises, such as flexing your ankles\n- take regular short walking breaks\n- avoid drinking lots of alcohol\n- wear compression socks\nSpeak to a healthcare professional if you&#8217;re planning any long-distance travel and have had DVT in the past, or if you&#8217;re at risk of it.\nDVT can be very serious as blood clots can travel to the lungs. This is called a pulmonary embolism. A pulmonary embolism can be life-threatening and needs to be treated quickly.\nIf you’ve had a DVT, you can develop long-term symptoms like pain and swelling. This is known as post-thrombotic syndrome."

        "description": "This information may be useful for those who have been medically diagnosed with degenerative cervical myelopathy. People who are experiencing new or ongoing symptoms should visit their healthcare professional for assessment, diagnosis or treatment.\nRead about managing a neck problem\nDegenerative cervical myelopathy is a condition that is caused by age related changes to the bones, ligaments and discs of the neck. This can sometimes cause pressure on the spinal cord which can affect function of the nerves.\nIt’s common to experience one or multiple symptoms.\nThe most common symptoms include:\n- pain or stiffness in the neck\n- tingling or numbness in the arms or legs (often starting in fingertips or toes) or less commonly in the body\n- change or loss in the manual coordination or dexterity in the hands (e.g. fastening buttons or tying shoelaces)\n- pain, weakness or heaviness in the arms or legs\n- imbalance or feeling unsteady which may lead to falls\n- difficulty walking\n- change of bladder or bowel function, such as increased urgency or incontinence\nMany people have a combination of neck pain, arm pain, numbness and weakness. These symptoms can be distressing, but don’t necessarily require urgent medical attention.\nSometimes symptoms can progress suddenly, early recognition and treatment can prevent further deterioration.\nIf you feel that your symptoms are gradually worsening over time you should contact your healthcare professional to discuss this.\nIn order for degenerative cervical myelopathy to be diagnosed you’ll need an assessment from a healthcare professional.\nThey’ll ask you questions about your symptoms and then carry out a physical examination. This may include checking your strength, movement and nerve function.\nDepending on the examination you may then be offered an MRI scan.\nYou may sometimes need to have a further examination to rule out other causes of these symptoms.\nDegenerative cervical mylopathy is a condition that causes pressure on the spinal cord which can affect function of the nerves. There are a number of reasons this pressure can happen including:\n- age related narrowing\n- significant changes to the bones, ligaments or discs in the neck\nAs we get older, aging in the spine can cause narrowing and a reduction of space for the spinal nerves leading to compression.\nThe treatments for degenerative cervical myelopathy depend on your assessment and investigation by your healthcare professional.\nSome peoples symptoms are able to be managed with self-management and modifications to their activities.\nYour healthcare professional may discuss whether surgery is an option for you.\nA neck problem can sometimes mean you need to take some time off work to help recovery. How long you’re off will depend on the nature of your condition and your role at work.\nThis is a long term condition and it&#8217;s a good idea to discuss with your employer or occupational health what support you need to return to or remain at work.\nWhen dealing with any health condition it’s important to also look after your mental wellbeing as this can impact your recovery."

        "description": "Dehydration is when your body loses more fluid than you take in. It can be serious if it isn’t treated.\nDrinking fluids (such as water, diluted squash or fruit juice) regularly can prevent dehydration.\nSymptoms of dehydration include:\n- feeling thirsty\n- having dark yellow, strong-smelling pee (urine)\n- peeing less often than usual (less than 3 or 4 times a day)\n- feeling dizzy or lightheaded\n- headache\n- feeling tired\n- a&nbsp;dry mouth, lips and eyes\n- sunken eyes\nA baby may be dehydrated if they have:\n- a sunken soft spot (fontanelle) on their head\n- sunken eyes\n- few or no tears when they cry\n- a dry mouth\n- fewer wet nappies\n- dark yellow pee\n- drowsiness or are irritable\n- fast breathing\n- cold and blotchy-looking hands and feet\nIf your GP practice is closed, phone 111.\nIf your GP suspects dehydration, you may have a&nbsp;blood test&nbsp;or a urine test to check the balance of salts in your body.\nDehydration is caused by not drinking enough fluid or by losing more fluid than you take in.\nFluid is lost through sweat, vomit, pee or diarrhoea.\nCauses of dehydration include:\n- illness – for example&nbsp;gastroenteritis, where you lose fluid through&nbsp;diarrhoea&nbsp;and&nbsp;vomiting\n- sweating too much – for example due to a fever, exercise, or manual work in high temperatures\n- drinking too much alcohol because it makes you pee more – a hangover headache is a sign you’re dehydrated\n- diabetes – high levels of glucose in your blood makes you pee more\nAnyone can become dehydrated but those more at risk are:\n- babies and infants – their low body weight makes them sensitive to even small amounts of fluid loss\n- older people – they may be less aware they’re becoming dehydrated and need to drink fluids\n- people with a long-term health condition – such as&nbsp;diabetes&nbsp;or alcoholism\n- athletes – they can lose a large amount of body fluid through sweat when exercising for long periods\nIt’s possible to become overhydrated while exercising. Overhydration is caused by low salt levels in the blood. It can occur if you drink too much water over a short period of time.\nIt sometimes affects athletes if salt is lost through sweat and diluted by drinking large amounts of water.\nSymptoms of overhydration include feeling sick, vomiting and headache. In serious cases, the brain can swell, causing confusion, seizures, coma and, in rare cases, death.\nIf you’re worried that you may be overhydrated, seek medical advice.\nIf you’re dehydrated, drink plenty of fluids such as water, diluted squash or fruit juice. These are better than tea, coffee or fizzy drinks.\nIf you’re finding it difficult to keep water down because you’re vomiting, try drinking small amounts more often.\nWhen you’re dehydrated, you lose sugar and salts, as well as water. Oral rehydration solutions can help treat this. These are powders that you mix with water and then drink. They contain a mixture of potassium and sodium salts, as well as glucose or starch.\nAsk your pharmacist or GP for advice about the right rehydration solution for you or your child.\nGive your baby plenty of liquids, such as breastmilk or formula. It can be better to give them smaller amounts of fluid more often.\nDon’t dilute your baby’s formula (if you use it). Babies who are formula-fed and those on solids can be given extra water.\nAvoid giving your baby fruit juice, particularly if they have diarrhoea and vomiting, because it can make it worse.\nGiving your baby regular sips (a few times an hour) of oral rehydration solution as well as their usual feed (breastmilk, formula milk and water) will help to replace lost fluids, salts and sugars. Ask your pharmacist for advice.\nInfants and children who are dehydrated shouldn’t only be given water. It can dilute the already low level of minerals in their body and make the problem worse. Instead, they should have diluted squash or oral rehydration solution. Ask your pharmacist for advice.\nIf your child is finding it difficult to keep fluid down because of vomiting, take small amounts more often. You may find it easier to use a spoon or a syringe into their mouth to give your child small amounts of fluid.\nIf severe dehydration is not treated immediately, it can lead to serious complications. Severe dehydration needs hospital treatment. You’ll be put on a drip to quickly replace fluid in your body."

        "disease": "Delirium",
        "description": "Delirium (acute confusional state) is when someone’s mental function has a sudden change. It comes on quickly, often over hours or days.\nAs well as showing confusion, people with delirium can be sleepy, agitated, have altered beliefs or see hallucinations.\nDelirium is often triggered by:\n- illness\n- the side affects of medication\n- an injury\n- having surgery\nPeople with delirium may experience symptoms that include:\n- being confused (or more confused than normal)\n- being sleepy and less responsive\n- being very agitated or restless\n- a change in sleeping pattern (like being awake at night and sleeping during the day)\n- suspiciousness or a loss of trust\n- seeing or hearing things that aren’t real\nSometimes these symptoms are worse in the evenings or overnight.\nMost delirium lasts a few days but in some cases it can persist for weeks or even months.\nDelirium can continue even when all triggers have been addressed. In this situation, you should get ongoing supportive care and help. In other cases, the delirium will slowly improve.\nUnfortunately, not all patients recover to the same mental function they had before their delirium.\nDelirium is caused by a change in the way the brain functions. There are many things that can trigger this, including:\n- an infection – including&nbsp;urinary tract infections (UTIs)&nbsp;and chest infections\n- prescription medicine – delirium can be a side effect or an effect of sudden withdrawal\n- dehydration\n- constipation\n- injuries (for example hip fractures)\n- low blood sugar level, for example in people with diabetes\n- alcohol withdrawal\n- surgery\n- severe psychological stress\nAnyone can get delirium but some things can increase the risk, including:\n- being over 65\n- having dementia\n- being frail\n- hearing or sight loss\n- having had delirium before\n- alcohol misuse\nDelirium is one of the most common medical emergencies. It’s found in around 1 in 7 adults in hospital and about half of patients in intensive care.\nRelatives and carers are often the first to notice signs of delirium. The key change is in the person’s normal mental function.\nHealthcare staff identify delirium by assessing the core symptoms. They will often do this using the 4A’s test or&nbsp;4AT.4AT is a quick test where a healthcare professional will ask their patient some orientation questions. For example, they could ask what year it is. They could also ask them to give the months of the year in reverse order.\nThe test helps to show if the patient has a different mental function to normal.\nThere are different aspects to the treatment of delirium.\nDelirium is usually caused by one or more triggers. Treatment starts by working out what the triggers are. Healthcare professionals can then treat these as effectively as possible. For example, if the person has a chest infection then treating it would help the delirium.\nOften more than one trigger may cause delirium. For example a person with a chest infection may also be dehydrated or have a low blood oxygen level. These would also trigger or make the delirium worse.\nAnother important part of delirium care is treating the symptoms of delirium.\nMany people become distressed due to feeling disorientated. They may also have paranoia, hallucinations or feel like they’re losing control.\nThese symptoms can improve with repeated reassurance and by explaining carefully what’s happening. Occasionally, healthcare professionals may use anti-psychotic drugs or other treatments.\nOnce the triggers and symptoms have been managed, the next step is to help the patient recover.\nThe aim is to get the person back to their usual self through:\n- rehabilitation\n- engagement with them\n- hydration\n- nutrition\nSome complications of delirium can include:\n- immobility\n- falls\n- pressure sores\n- isolation\nWhen caring for someone with delirium, it’s helpful to:\n- ensure hearing aids, glasses and dentures are within reach\n- have a gentle and friendly approach – smile and provide reassurance\n- talk and keep the person informed in short, simple sentences\n- try to make sure someone the person knows well is with them\n- keep a calendar or clock (or both) within view\n- bring in some familiar objects from the person’s home to keep next to their bedside, for example photographs\n- if it’s safe to do so, help the person to eat and drink (check with care staff if you have any doubts)\nCaring for someone else can be stressful. Try to ensure you are sleeping and eating and try to create a support network.\nAfter recovering from delirium, there’s an increased risk of dementia. People living with dementia who develop delirium may be worse after delirium.\nPeople who have experienced distress during delirium may develop post traumatic stress symptoms. This includes intrusive memories of delirium and symptoms of anxiety and depression.\nDelirium is very common in people in their last days of life, affecting up to half of people in this situation.\nIt’s important to identify the delirium and, where possible, consider if there are easily treatable triggers. However, the main focus of care is in managing the symptoms.\nRead more about palliative care\nDelirium comes on over hours or days and, in most cases, it will get better in a few days. Dementia develops over months or years and is nearly always irreversible.\nDelirium and dementia symptoms can sometimes overlap, for example disorientation is usual in both conditions. However people with delirium are more likely to:\n- be drowsy\n- be agitated\n- be paranoid\n- have hallucinations\nThe 2 conditions often co-exist, especially in older people. People with dementia are much more likely to develop delirium. In hospital at least half of older people with delirium will also have dementia."

        "disease": "Dental abscess",
        "description": "A dental abscess is a collection of pus that can form inside the teeth, in the gums, or in the bone that holds the teeth in place. It’s caused by a bacterial infection.\nAn abscess at the end of a tooth is called a periapical abscess. An abscess in the gum is called a periodontal abscess.\nDental abscesses are often painful, but aren’t always. In either case, they should be looked at by a dentist.\nYou should get help as soon as possible, because abscesses don’t go away on their own. They can sometimes spread to other parts of the face and neck and make you ill.\nSymptoms of an abscess in your tooth or gum may include:\n- an intense, throbbing pain in the affected tooth or gum that may come on suddenly and gets gradually worse\n- pain that spreads to your ear, jaw and neck on the same side as the affected tooth or gum\n- pain that’s worse when lying down, which may disturb your sleep\n- redness and swelling in your face\n- a tender, discoloured and/or loose tooth\n- shiny, red and swollen gums\n- sensitivity to hot or cold food and drink\n- bad breath and/or an unpleasant taste in your mouth\nIf the infection spreads, you may also develop a high temperature (fever) and feel generally unwell. In severe cases, you may find it hard to fully open your mouth and have difficulty swallowing or breathing.\nWhile you’re waiting to see a dentist, painkillers can help control your pain.\nIbuprofen is the preferred painkiller for dental abscesses. If you’re unable to take it for medical reasons, you can take paracetamol instead.\nAspirin shouldn’t be given to children under 16.\nIf one painkiller doesn’t relieve the pain, taking both paracetamol and ibuprofen at the doses shown in the medicine leaflet may help. This is safe for adults, but not for children under 16.\nIt may also help to:\n- avoid hot or cold food and drink if it makes the pain worse\n- try eating cool, soft foods if possible, using the opposite side of your mouth\n- use a soft toothbrush\nThese measures can help relieve your symptoms temporarily, but you shouldn’t use them to delay getting help from a dentist.\nDental abscesses are treated by removing the source of the infection and draining away the pus.\nDepending on the location of the abscess and how severe the infection is, possible treatments include:\n- removing the affected tooth (extraction) – this may be necessary if root canal treatment isn’t possible\n- root canal treatment – a procedure to remove the abscess from the root of an affected tooth before filling and sealing it\n- incision and drainage – where a small cut (incision) is made in the gum to drain the abscess (this is usually only a temporary solution)\nLocal anaesthetic will usually be used to numb your mouth for these procedures. More extensive operations may be carried out under general anaesthetic (where you’re asleep).\nAntibiotics aren’t routinely prescribed for dental abscesses, but may be used if the infection spreads or is particularly severe.\nYour mouth is full of bacteria, which form a sticky film on your teeth called plaque.\nIf you don’t keep your teeth clean, acids produced by the bacteria in plaque can damage your teeth and gums, leading to tooth decay or gum disease.\nThe following can increase your chances of developing a dental abscess:\n- poor oral hygiene – plaque can build-up on your teeth if you don’t brush and clean in between your teeth regularly\n- too much sugary food and drink – these cause growth of bacteria in plaque and may lead to decay that can result in an abscess\n- an injury or previous surgery to your teeth or gums – bacteria can get into any damaged parts of the teeth or gums\n- having a weakened immune system – this includes people with certain underlying health conditions, such as diabetes, and those having treatment, including steroid medication or chemotherapy\nYou can reduce your risk of developing dental abscesses by keeping your teeth and gums as healthy as possible.\n\n- use an interdental brush or floss at least once a day to clean between your teeth and under the gum line\n- brush your teeth with a fluoride toothpaste twice a day &ndash; spending at least 2 minutes each time\n- avoid rinsing your mouth with water or mouthwash after brushing because this washes the protective toothpaste away\n- cut down on sugary food and drinks &ndash; particularly between meals or shortly before going to bed\n- visit your dentist regularly &ndash; your dentist can suggest how often you should have a check-up, based on your oral health\n\nRead more on how to keep your teeth clean and dental check-ups."

        "disease": "Depression",
        "description": "Everyone has spells of feeling down, but depression is more than just spending a few days feeling sad or unhappy. Depression can make you feel persistently sad and down for weeks or months at a time.\nWhile some people believe that depression is trivial or not a genuine health problem, it&#8217;s actually a real condition that affects around one in 10 people over the course of their lives. It impacts people of all genders and ages – including children. Studies show that around 4% of children in the UK between the ages of five and 16 are depressed or anxious.\nWith the right support and treatment, most people recover fully from depression.\nDepression has a range of different symptoms, and it can affect everybody differently. The symptoms include feeling very tearful, feeling hopelessness and sadness, and losing interest in things you enjoyed before. It&#8217;s also common for people with depression to have symptoms of anxiety.\nPhysical symptoms happen with depression too – these can include feeling tired all the time, getting poor sleep, losing your sex drive, losing your appetite, and feeling aches and pains.\nIf the symptoms are mild, you might simply experience a persistent low mood. It&#8217;s common to feel stressed, sad or anxious during difficult times in your life, and a low mood can get better after a short time, rather than being a symptom of depression.\nSevere symptoms of depression can make people feel suicidal – as if life is no longer worth living. Read more about depression symptoms here.\nBig changes in your life, like bereavement, losing a job, or even having a baby, can cause symptoms of depression. You&#8217;re also more likely to experience depression if you have a family history of depression. However, it&#8217;s also possible to become depressed without there being an obvious reason.\nYou can learn more about depression causes here.\nSymptoms of depression can be very different from person to person. However, as a general rule, if you are depressed you feel hopeless, sad and lacking interest in things that used to make you feel happy.\nDepression symptoms are bad enough to interfere with work, social life and family life, and can persist for weeks or months.\nDoctors describe depression in one of three ways, depending on how serious it is:\n- mild depression – it has some impact on daily life\n- moderate depression – it has a significant impact on your daily life\n- severe depression – this makes it nearly impossible to get through your life day to day\nA few people with severe depression may have symptoms of psychotic depression.\nBelow is a list of depression symptoms – it&#8217;s unlikely that one person would have all of them.\n- continuous sadness or low mood\n- losing interest in things\n- losing motivation\n- not getting any enjoyment in life\n- feeling tearful\n- feeling guilty\n- feeling anxious\n- feeling irritable\n- finding it hard to make decisions\n- feeling intolerant of other people\n- feeling helpless\n- feeling hopeless\n- low self-esteem\n- feeling worried\n- thinking about suicide\n- thinking about harming yourself\n- speaking or moving slower than usual\n- aches and pains that can&#8217;t be explained\n- losing, or sometimes gaining, appetite or weight\n- constipation\n- loss of interest in sex\n- disturbed sleep (having trouble falling asleep, for example, or waking up very early)\n- loss of energy\n- changes in your menstrual cycle (the time of the month when you get your period)\nSocial symptoms are common too. These include:\n- avoiding talking to or spending time with your friends\n- taking part in fewer social activities\n- neglecting interests and hobbies\n- doing poorly at work\n- difficulties with your family or home life\nIt&#8217;s not always possible to tell that you&#8217;re having symptoms of depression right away – it can start and progress gradually. A lot of people don&#8217;t realise they&#8217;re ill and try to carry on and cope with their symptoms. Sometimes it takes a friend or family member to notice that there&#8217;s a problem.\nDepression and grief have a lot of the same features, and it can be hard to tell them apart. However, they&#8217;re different in many important ways. Depression is an illness – grief is a completely natural response to loss.\nIf you&#8217;re grieving, you may find your feelings of sadness and loss come and go, but it&#8217;s still possible to enjoy things in life and look forward to the future.\nPeople with depression feel sad persistently, find it difficult to be positive about the future, and don&#8217;t get enjoyment from anything.\nThere are different types of depression, and there are some conditions where depression is a symptom. These conditions include:\n- Bipolar disorder – people with bipolar disorder, which is also known as &#8220;manic depression&#8221;, experience times of depression, where the symptoms are similar to clinical depression. They also go through phases when they have excessively high moods (known as &#8220;mania&#8221;). Bouts of mania can include harmful behaviour like unsafe sex, spending sprees and gambling.\n- Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is also called &#8220;winter depression&#8221;. It&#8217;s depression that is related to weather, usually winter, so it happens seasonally.\n- Postnatal depression happens to some women after they&#8217;ve had a baby. It&#8217;s treated similarly to other types of depression, with antidepressant medication and talking therapy.\nLearn more about how depression is diagnosed here.\nDepression doesn&#8217;t have one single cause – it can have a range of triggers, and there are many different reasons a person can develop the condition. Some people are affected after a stressful life event, like a bereavement or divorce. Other people experience depression related to illness, job loss, or money worries.\nDifferent reasons can combine and trigger depression. If you&#8217;re feeling low after a job loss or health issues, and then experience something traumatic, like a bereavement, you can develop depression.\nIt&#8217;s common to hear about depression being brought on by a &#8220;downward spiral&#8221; – one thing causing other problems that combine to cause depression. For example, losing your job could make you feel sad, so you spend less time with family and friends and maybe drink more alcohol. These things all make you feel worse, which triggers depression.\nThere are studies that suggest people are more likely to become depressed when they get older. There&#8217;s also evidence that depression is more common for people whose economic and social circumstances are difficult.\nLong-lasting or life-threatening conditions like cancer or coronary heart disease can put you at higher risk of developing depression.\nMany people don&#8217;t know that head injuries can cause depression, and a severe head injury can lead to emotional problems and mood swings.\nUnderactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) can happen as a result of immune system problems. It&#8217;s also possible, although rare, for a minor head injury to damage the pituitary gland. This is a gland the size of a pea which sits at the base of the brain and produces hormones that stimulate the thyroid. Damage to the pituitary gland can cause symptoms, including severe tiredness and a lack of interest in sex, which can then cause people to develop depression.\n&#8220;Drowning your sorrows&#8221; is actually a bad idea when it comes to depression. Alcohol is categorised as a &#8220;strong depressant&#8221; which can make depression worse, and drinking or taking drugs to cope can lead to a downward spiral by having a negative affect on other parts of your life.\nThere&#8217;s evidence that cannabis can cause depression, particularly in teenagers, even if it helps you relax.\nThere are a number of things that can lead to developing depression.\n- Stressful events – big changes in your life, like bereavement, the end of a relationship or the loss of a job, can be difficult to deal with. When these things happen, it&#8217;s important to keep seeing friends and family instead of trying to deal with problems alone – this increases your risk of developing depression.\n- Giving birth – pregnancy and birth can make some people vulnerable to depression. Postnatal depression can happen as the result of physical changes, hormonal changes, and the responsibility of taking care of a new baby.\n- Loneliness – your risk of depression gets higher if you aren&#8217;t in contact or spending time with family and friends.\n- Personality – some personality traits can put you at a higher risk of developing depression. These include low-self esteem or a habit of criticising yourself too much. These personality traits can come from your genes, which you get from your parents, or they can be as a result of experiences in your early life.\n- Family history – it&#8217;s more likely for someone to develop depression if a family member, like a sibling or parent, has experienced it before.\nThere&#8217;s no physical test for depression.\nIf you experience depression symptoms most of the day, every day, for more than two weeks, you should visit your GP. This is especially important if:\n- you have symptoms of depression that aren&#8217;t getting any better\n- you have thoughts of self-harm or suicide\n- your work, relationships with friends and family, or interests are affected by your mood\nIt can be hard for people with depression to imagine that anything can help them – but the sooner you seek help, the sooner the symptoms start to get better.\nYour GP may examine you and perform blood or urine tests to make sure there isn&#8217;t another condition causing your depression symptoms, like an underactive thyroid.\nWhen you see your GP, they&#8217;ll try to find out if you have depression by asking you questions. These are likely to be about your health, how you&#8217;re feeling, and how that is affecting you mentally and physically.\nTelling your doctor your symptoms and the affect they are having on you will help your GP to tell if you have depression, and how severe the condition is. It&#8217;s important to be as open as possible.\nYour conversation with your GP will be confidential. This rule can only be broken if your GP thinks there is a significant risk of harm to you or others, and that telling a family member or carer would make that risk lower.\nThe first place to go is your GP – they will refer to you local talking treatments for depression that are available on the NHS.\nYou may also have the option to self-refer, depending on where you live, so you can go directly to a professional therapist if you&#8217;d rather not talk to your GP.\nThere are a number of talking therapies for depression.\nCBT helps you make sense of your thoughts and behaviour and the affect they have on you. Part of it&#8217;s recognising that past events may have played a part in making you who you are, but the main focus is changing how you feel, behave and think now.\nYou can use CBT to learn how to overcome negative thoughts – this can help you to tackle feelings of hopelessness, for example.\nMost people have a course of six to eight CBT sessions that goes over 10 to 12 weeks. Sessions are one-to-one, between you and a CBT-trained counsellor. You might also be offered group CBT.\nThis type of CBT is done using a computer instead of face-to-face with the counsellor. It should be supported by a healthcare professional – your GP may prescribe it, and you might have to use the computer in the GP surgery to access it. CCBT involves a series of weekly sessions.\nIPT is focused on your relationships with people around you, and problems that you might be having with them. These can include problems communicating, or dealing with a bereavement.\nThere&#8217;s evidence that suggests IPT can be as effective for depression as CBT or medication, but more research needs to be done.\nThis is also known as psychoanalytic psychotherapy. You&#8217;ll work with a therapist who encourages you to say whatever you&#8217;re thinking. This helps you to find hidden patterns and meanings in your words and behaviour that could be contributing to your depression.\nRead more about psychotherapy here.\nCounselling is a type of therapy that works really well if you have good mental wellbeing overall but need help coping with a crisis that&#8217;s currently going on in your life. These can include anger, bereavement, infertility, relationship problems, job loss and serious illness.\nOn the NHS, counselling usually takes place over six to 12 sessions, each an hour long. The sessions are confidential.\nA counsellor helps you to think about what&#8217;s going on in your life and find new ways of dealing with the problems. They&#8217;ll offer practical advice, support you, and help you find solutions, but they don&#8217;t tell you what to do.\nAntidepressants are medicines that treat depression symptoms. There are almost 30 different types of antidepressant that can be prescribed to you.\nMost people who have moderate or severe depression notice improvement when they take antidepressants, but this isn&#8217;t the case for everyone. One type of antidepressant might not work for you, but another one could. It can take two or more different treatments to find the right one for you.\nSide effects vary between different people and different antidepressants, but the different types of antidepressant all work around as well as each other.\nIf you&#8217;re prescribed antidepressants, you should see your GP or specialist nurse regularly while you first start taking the medication – every week or two for at least four weeks. This is so your treatment provider can see how the antidepressants are working.\nIf the medication is working for you, you should continue taking them at the same dose for at least four to six months after the depression symptoms have eased. People who have had depression in the past might have to take antidepressants for up to five years, maybe longer.\nAntidepressants aren&#8217;t addictive. However, you might have withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking them suddenly or miss a dose. You can read more about withdrawal symptoms below.\nIf your GP thinks you would benefit from taking an antidepressant, you&#8217;ll usually be prescribed a modern type called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Examples of commonly used SSRI antidepressants are Seroxat (paroxetine), Prozac (fluoxetine) and Cipramil (citalopram).\nThey help increase the level of a natural chemical in your brain called serotonin, which is thought to be a &#8220;good mood&#8221; chemical.\nSSRIs work just as well as older antidepressants and have fewer side effects.\nThey can, however, cause nausea and headaches, as well as a dry mouth and problems having sex. However, all these negative effects usually improve over time.\nSome SSRIs aren&#8217;t suitable for children under the age of 18. Research shows that the risk of self-harm and suicidal behaviour may increase if they&#8217;re taken by under-18s. Fluoxetine is the only SSRI that can be prescribed for under-18s, and even then only when a specialist has given the go-ahead.\nThis group of antidepressants is used to treat moderate to severe depression.\nTCAs, which includes Imipramil (imipramine) and amitriptyline, have been around for longer than SSRIs.\nThey work by raising the levels of the chemicals serotonin and noradrenaline in your brain. These both help lift your mood.\nThey&#8217;re generally quite safe, but it&#8217;s a bad idea to smoke cannabis if you are taking TCAs because it can cause your heart to beat rapidly.\nSide effects of TCAs may include a dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, problems passing urine, sweating, light-headedness and excessive drowsiness, but vary from person to person.\nThe side effects usually ease after seven to 10 days, as your body gets used to the medication.\nNew antidepressants, such as Efexor (venlafaxine), Cymbalta or Yentreve (duloxetine) and Zispin Soltab (mirtazapine), work in a slightly different way from SSRIs and TCAs.\nVenlafaxine and duloxetine are known as SNRIs (serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors). Like TCAs, they change the levels of serotonin and noradrenaline in your brain.\nStudies have shown that an SNRI can be more effective than an SSRI, though they&#8217;re not routinely prescribed as they can lead to a rise in blood pressure.\nAntidepressants are not addictive in the same way that illegal drugs and cigarettes are, but when you stop taking them you may have some withdrawal symptoms, including:\n- upset stomach\n- flu-like symptoms\n- anxiety\n- dizziness\n- vivid dreams at night\n- sensations in the body that feel like electric shocks\nIn most cases these are quite mild and last no longer than a week or two, but occasionally they can be quite severe. They seem to be most likely to occur with paroxetine (Seroxat) and venlafaxine (Efexor).\nWithdrawal symptoms occur very soon after stopping the tablets, so can easily be told apart from symptoms of depression relapse, which tend to occur after a few weeks.\nThere is a range of other treatments that people are given for depression.\nSt John&#8217;s Wort is a herbal treatment that you can buy from pharmacies and health food shops. Some people take it for depression. There&#8217;s some evidence that it can help the symptoms of mild-to-moderate depression, but doctors don&#8217;t recommend St John&#8217;s Wort because the amount of active ingredients change depending on the brand and batch. This means that you can never be sure what kind of effect it will have.\nIf you take St John&#8217;s Wort with other medications, like anticonvulsants, anticoagulants, antidepressants and the contraceptive pill, it can cause serious problems. St John&#8217;s Wort can interact with the contraceptive pill and reduce its effectiveness at preventing pregnancy.\nYou shouldn&#8217;t take St John&#8217;s Wort while pregnant or breastfeeding, as we can&#8217;t be certain that it&#8217;s safe.\nIf you have severe depression and other treatments, like medication, haven&#8217;t worked, ECT might be recommended for you.\nWhen receiving ECT, you will be given an anaesthetic and medication that relaxes your muscles to begin with. Electrodes will be placed on your head that give an electrical &#8220;shock&#8221; to your brain.\nECT is given over a series of sessions, normally twice a week for three to six weeks.\nECT can cause side effects including nausea, headaches, aches in the muscles and memory problems.\nMost people find that ECT is good for relieving severe depression, but the beneficial effects tend to wear off when several months have passed.\nIf you&#8217;ve tried several different antidepressants and had no improvement, your doctor may offer you a type of medication called lithium in addition to your current treatment.\nThere are two types of lithium: lithium carbonate and lithium citrate. Both are usually effective, but if you&#8217;re taking one that works for you, it&#8217;s best not to change.\nIf the level of lithium in your blood becomes too high, it can become toxic. You&#8217;ll therefore need blood tests every three months to check your lithium levels while you&#8217;re on the medication.\nYou&#8217;ll also need to avoid eating a low-salt diet because this can also cause the lithium to become toxic. Ask your GP for advice about your diet.\nThere&#8217;s a lot of advice available for living with depression and feeling better.\nYou can find support and insight by talking about depression with another person or a group. According to research, talking can help you to recover and deal better with stress.\nIf you don&#8217;t feel comfortable talking about your symptoms and feelings with other people, you can write about how you feel or use poetry or art to express yourself – doing this can also help you to feel better.\nIt might feel like cigarettes and alcohol are helpful, but in the long run they can make you feel worse.\nIf you have depression it&#8217;s especially important to be careful when it comes to cannabis. Research has shown there&#8217;s a strong connection between mental health problems and cannabis use.\nAccording to the evidence, if you smoke cannabis while dealing with depression:\n- your symptoms get worse\n- you feel less interested in things\n- you&#8217;re more likely to have earlier and more frequent relapses of depression\n- you&#8217;re less likely to recover fully from depression\n- you feel more tired\n- you won&#8217;t respond as well to antidepressants\n- you&#8217;re more likely to stop taking antidepressants\nYou can get advice and support from your GP on cutting down or stopping drinking, smoking, and drug use.\nLearn more about stopping smoking here\nLearn more about help to cut down or stop drinking alcohol here\nYou might need to take time off work if your depression is caused by working too much, or if the symptoms are making it hard for you to do your job. However, research has shown that taking a long time off work can make depression worse, and that going back to work can help you to get better.\nWhen you&#8217;re dealing with depression it&#8217;s important to avoid as much stress, work-related and otherwise, as you can. If you&#8217;re working you might be able to change to shorter hours, or work more flexibly. This is especially true if pressure at work causes you to experience depression symptoms.\nThe Equality Act means that employers need to make reasonable adjustments to make it possible to employ people with disabilities – this can include people who have been diagnosed with depression and other mental health conditions.\nYou can find more information about dealing with stress at work here.\nIf your depression means you are unable to work, there are benefits you may be eligible to claim. These include:\n- Attendance Allowance\n- Carer&#8217;s Allowance\n- Council Tax Benefit\n- Personal Independence Payment (PIP)\n- Housing Benefit\n- Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)\n- Statutory Sick Pay\nYour depression can be triggered by losing someone who is close to you. The emotional blow suffered when a person you care about dies is powerful – it might feel like you will never recover from the loss.\nAlong with time, the right help and support can make it possible to start living your life again.\nIf you&#8217;re close to someone with depression, their condition can affect you too. Your relationship, and family life in general, can be strained, and you might not know what to do or how to help.\nTalking about the situation can help. Finding a support group, or talking to other people in a similar situation, can make it easier to cope. If the condition is causing difficulties in your relationship with your partner, you could contact a relationship counsellor who can talk things through with both of you.\nWhen suffering from depression, men are less likely to ask for help than women. They&#8217;re also more likely to turn to drugs and alcohol to cope with the symptoms.\nThe majority of suicide cases are linked with mental disorders, and most of them are triggered by severe depression.\nWarning signs that someone with depression may be considering suicide are:\n- making final arrangements, like giving away their things, making a will or saying goodbye to friends\n- talking about death or suicide – this may be with direct statements, like &#8220;I wish I was dead&#8221;, but often depressed people talk about the subject indirectly, saying things like: &#8220;I think dead people must be happier than us&#8221; or &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t it be nice to go to sleep and never wake up&#8221;\n- self-harm, like cutting their arms or legs, or burning themselves with cigarettes\n- a sudden lifting of mood, which could mean that a person has decided to commit suicide and feels better because of this decision\nIf you&#8217;re feeling suicidal or are in a crisis of depression, contact your GP as soon as possible. They will be able to help you.\nIf you can&#8217;t or don&#8217;t want to contact your GP, call the Samaritans on 116 123, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Alternatively, visit the Samaritans website or email&nbsp;jo@samaritans.org.\nIf you see any of the above warning signs:\n- get professional help for the person\n- let them know they&#8217;re not alone and that you care about them\n- offer your support in finding other solutions to their problems\nIf you feel there is an immediate danger, stay with the person or have someone else stay with them, and remove all available means of committing suicide, such as medication.\nOver-the-counter drugs such as painkillers can be just as dangerous as prescription medication.\nAlso, remove sharp objects and poisonous household chemicals such as bleach.\nSome people who have severe depression will also experience symptoms of psychosis – these are hallucinations and delusional thinking.\nDepression with psychosis is known as psychotic depression.\nPeople who have severe clinical depression feel sad and hopeless for most of the day, and feel no interest in anything. They feel this way practically every day, and getting through the day feels nearly impossible for them.\nOther symptoms include:\n- fatigue (exhaustion)\n- losing pleasure in things\n- inability to concentrate\n- difficulty making decisions\n- sleep disturbance\n- appetite changes\n- feeling guilty\n- feeling that they&#8217;re worthless\n- having thoughts about suicide, or death\nRead more about the different types of depression symptoms here.\nMoments of psychosis are known as psychotic episodes. The person experiencing a psychotic episode will have:\n- Delusions – beliefs or thoughts that are likely to be false.\n- Hallucinations – hearing, seeing or sometimes smelling, feeling or tasting things that aren&#8217;t there. Hearing voices is a common type of hallucination.\nHallucinations and delusions almost always reflect the deeply depressed mood of the person experiencing them. They may believe they have committed a crime or that they are to blame for something.\nPeople with psychosis also commonly experience something called psychomotor agitation. People experiencing this cannot sit still or relax, and fidget all the time.\nThe opposite symptom can also happen – psychomotor retardation can cause a person&#8217;s thoughts and the movement of their body to slow down.\nPeople who have psychotic depression are at a higher risk of thinking about suicide.\nWe don&#8217;t fully understand what causes psychotic depression yet. However, we know that depression doesn&#8217;t have one single cause, and that the condition has a lot of different triggers.\nBig, stressful events like divorce, serious illness, financial worries, or bereavement can trigger depression for some people.\nSevere depression can run in families, which suggests genes might play a role in depression, but the reason some people develop psychosis as part of severe depression is not known.\nMany people who have psychotic depression have experienced a difficult time in childhood, like a traumatic event.\nLearn more about causes of clinical depression\nTreatment for psychotic depression has three main parts:\n- medication – taking a combination of antipsychotics and antidepressants can help to relieve psychosis symptoms\n- psychological therapies – cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a talking therapy done one-to-one with a trained counsellor, and it has succeeded in helping some people with psychosis\n- social support – support with social needs like employment, education and accommodation\nPeople with psychotic depression may have to spend some time in hospital to receive treatment.\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT, or electric shock treatment) is sometimes recommended if other treatments, including antidepressants, haven&#8217;t worked for severe depression.\nAlthough treatment for psychotic depression is usually very effective, people with the condition still need follow-up appointments with their treatment team so they can be continuously monitored.\nOften friends, relatives, or carers have to seek help for a person with psychotic depression. This is because people with psychosis often don&#8217;t know they&#8217;re acting and thinking strangely.\nIf you&#8217;re worried about someone you know and think they may be experiencing psychosis, and they&#8217;ve been diagnosed with a mental health condition before, contact their community mental health team or social worker.\nIf they&#8217;ve never shown signs of a mental health condition and you think they may be experiencing psychotic depression, contact their GP or take them to Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E).\nIf you think the person&#8217;s symptoms are putting them at risk, you can:\n- take them to the nearest A&amp;E, if they agree\n- phone their GP\n- phone the local out-of-hours GP\n- phone 999 and ask for an ambulance\nVisit the SANE website or the Mind website for more information, support and advice about psychotic depression.\nLearn more about psychosis here\nPart of treating and living with depression is learning healthy thought patterns and coping skills that can help when you’re feeling depressed.&nbsp;\nOur mental health self-help guides are based on&nbsp;Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)&nbsp;and have proven highly successful in helping people with depression and other mental health issues.\nWork through a self-help guide for depression that uses Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)."

        "disease": "Dermatitis herpetiformis",
        "description": "Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an autoimmune skin condition that can be linked to&nbsp;coeliac disease.\nDH affects around 1 in 10,000 people.\nDH can appear at any age, but is most commonly diagnosed in those between the ages of 15 and 40.\nIt&#8217;s more common in men than women and is rare in children.\nPeople with DH can have:\n- red, raised patches often with blisters that burst with scratching\n- severe itching and often stinging\nThe rash can affect any area of the skin but is most commonly seen on the:\n- elbows\n- knees\n- buttocks\nThe rash usually occurs on both sides of the body, for example on both elbows.\nMost people with DH will have the same kind of gut damage seen with coeliac disease, but may not complain of gut symptoms like:\n- diarrhoea\n- constipation\n- stomach pain\n- bloating\nJust over half (60%) of people with DH don&#8217;t have gut symptoms.\nDH is caused by the body&#8217;s immune system reacting to a protein called gluten in foods containing wheat, barley and rye. This reaction causes a skin rash to develop.\nA diagnosis of DH is confirmed by a skin test called a skin biopsy. A skin biopsy is a procedure where a sample of skin is removed to be tested.\nAs DH is strongly linked to coeliac disease, blood tests may be taken for this condition as well.\nDuring a skin biopsy test, a specialist skin doctor called a dermatologist will take a small sample of skin from an area without the rash. Samples of skin taken from the area with the rash don&#8217;t always give an accurate result.\nThe skin sample is then tested. If you test positive for DH you&#8217;ll be referred to a specialist gut doctor called a gastroenterologist to be tested for coeliac disease.\nTo ensure an accurate skin test is taken first time, it&#8217;s important to keep eating foods with gluten before and during diagnosis.\nIf you&#8217;ve already removed gluten from your diet, you must reintroduce it in more than one meal every day. You should do this for at least 6 weeks before having the tests.\nThe treatment for DH is a lifelong gluten-free diet.\nA gluten-free diet is when all gluten-containing foods are removed from your diet\nGluten is found in wheat, barley and rye and sometimes people are sensitive to oats too.\nA gluten free diet should only start once the diagnosis of DH is given and a referral to a dietitian has been made.\nFind out how to live with a gluten-free diet\nThe length of time it takes for the skin to heal varies from person to person but it can take up to 2 years or more.\nSome patients will be given medication to help them over this period of recovery.\nMedication will only be given to control the skin itching and blisters and doesn&#8217;t treat any other symptoms.\nThe drug most likely to be used is called Dapsone.\nDapsone is taken in tablet form and must be swallowed.\nIt helps ease the itching and controls the development of blisters. It should work within a few days.\nIf you stop taking Dapsone before the gluten-free diet has taken effect, the rash will return.\nThe most common side effect of Dapsone is anaemia.\nLess common side effects are headaches and depression, while nerve damage is rare.\nYou&#8217;ll always be prescribed the lowest effective dose to help prevent these side effects.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nDH should be monitored once the drug dose has been reduced.\nSome people can&#8217;t tolerate Dapsone. If you&#8217;re one of these people, the following drugs can also be taken to clear the rash:\n- Sulphapyridine\n- Sulphamethoxypyridazine\nDH can cause the same conditions and complications as coeliac disease.&nbsp;\nSome potential complications of DH include:\n- osteoporosis\n- certain kinds of gut cancer\n- an increased risk of other autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes and thyroid disease\nAs with coeliac disease, the risk of developing these is reduced by following a gluten-free diet."

        "disease": "Diabetic retinopathy",
        "description": "Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes, caused by high blood sugar levels damaging the back of the eye (retina). It can cause blindness if left undiagnosed and untreated.\nHowever, it usually takes several years for diabetic retinopathy to reach a stage where it could threaten your sight.\nTo minimise the risk of this happening, people with diabetes should:\n- ensure they control their blood sugar levels, blood pressure and cholesterol\n- attend diabetic eye screening appointments – annual screening is offered to all people with diabetes aged 12 and over to pick up and treat any problems early on\nThe retina is the light-sensitive layer of cells at the back of the eye that converts light into electrical signals. The signals are sent to the brain&nbsp;and the&nbsp;brain turns them into the images you see.\nThe retina needs a constant supply of blood, which it receives through a network of tiny blood vessels. Over time, a persistently&nbsp;high blood sugar level can damage these blood vessels in three main stages:\n- tiny bulges develop in the blood vessels, which may bleed slightly but don’t usually affect your vision – this is known as background retinopathy\n- more severe and widespread changes affect the blood vessels, including more significant bleeding into the eye&nbsp;– this is known as pre-proliferative retinopathy\n- scar tissue and new blood vessels, which are weak and bleed easily, develop on the retina&nbsp;– this is known as proliferative retinopathy and it can result in some&nbsp;loss of vision\nHowever, if a problem with your eyes is picked up early, lifestyle changes and/or treatment can stop&nbsp;it getting worse.\nRead about the&nbsp;stages of diabetic retinopathy\nAnyone with&nbsp;type 1 diabetes or&nbsp;type 2 diabetes is potentially at risk of developing diabetic retinopathy.\nYou&#8217;re at a greater risk if you:\n- have&nbsp;had diabetes for a long time\n- have a persistently high blood sugar (blood glucose)&nbsp;level\n- have high blood pressure\n- have high cholesterol\n- are pregnant\n- are of Asian or Afro-Caribbean background\nBy keeping your blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol levels under control, you can reduce your&nbsp;chances&nbsp;of developing diabetic retinopathy.\nYou won&#8217;t usually notice diabetic retinopathy in the early stages, as&nbsp;it doesn&#8217;t tend to have&nbsp;any obvious symptoms until&nbsp;it&#8217;s more advanced.\nHowever, early signs of the condition can be picked up by taking photographs of the eyes during&nbsp;diabetic eye screening.\nContact your optician immediately if you experience:\n- gradually worsening vision\n- sudden vision loss\n- shapes floating in your field of vision (floaters)\n- blurred or patchy vision\n- eye pain or redness\nThese symptoms don&#8217;t necessarily mean you have diabetic retinopathy, but it&#8217;s important to get them checked out.&nbsp;Don&#8217;t wait until your next screening appointment.\nEveryone with diabetes who is 12 years old or over&nbsp;is invited for eye screening once a year.\nScreening is&nbsp;offered because:\n- diabetic retinopathy doesn&#8217;t tend to cause any symptoms in the early stages\n- the condition can cause permanent blindness if not diagnosed and treated promptly\n- screening can detect problems in your eyes before they start to affect your&nbsp;vision\n- if problems are caught early, treatment can help prevent or reduce vision loss\nThe screening test involves examining the back of the eyes and taking photographs. Depending on your result, you may be advised to return for another appointment a year later, attend more regular appointments, or discuss treatment options with a specialist.\nRead more about diabetic eye screening\nYou can reduce your risk of developing diabetic retinopathy, or help prevent it getting worse, by:\n- controlling your blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol levels\n- taking your diabetes medication as prescribed\n- attending all your screening appointments\n- getting medical&nbsp;advice quickly if you notice any changes to your vision\n- maintaining a healthy weight, eating a healthy, balanced diet, exercising regularly and stopping smoking\nRead more about how to prevent diabetic retinopathy.\nTreatment for diabetic retinopathy is only necessary if screening detects significant problems that mean your vision is at risk.\nIf the condition hasn&#8217;t reached this stage, the above advice on managing your diabetes is recommended.\nThe main treatments for more advanced diabetic retinopathy are:\n- laser treatment\n- injections of medication into your eyes\n- an operation to remove blood or scar tissue from your eyes\nRead more about the treatment of diabetic retinopathy\nDiabetic retinopathy develops in stages over time.\nIf you&#8217;re diagnosed with&nbsp;diabetic retinopathy after diabetic eye screening, lifestyle changes and/or treatment can reduce the chances of the problem progressing.\nThe main stages of diabetic retinopathy are described below. You won’t necessarily experience all of these.\nThis means that tiny bulges (microaneurysms) have&nbsp;appeared in the blood vessels in the back of&nbsp;your eyes (retina), which&nbsp;may leak small amounts of blood. This is very common in people with&nbsp;diabetes.\nAt this stage:\n- your sight isn&#8217;t affected, although you&#8217;re at a higher risk of developing vision problems in the future\n- you don&#8217;t need treatment,&nbsp;but you&#8217;ll need to take care to prevent the problem getting worse – read more about preventing diabetic retinopathy\n- the chances of&nbsp;it progressing to the stages below within three years is over 25% if both of your eyes are affected\nThis means that more severe and widespread changes are seen in the retina, including bleeding into the retina.\nAt this stage:\n- there&#8217;s a high risk that your vision could eventually be affected\n- you&#8217;ll usually be advised to have more frequent screening appointments every three or six months to monitor your eyes\nThis means that new blood vessels and scar tissue have formed on your retina, which can cause significant bleeding and lead to&nbsp;retinal detachment (where the retina pulls away from the back of the eye).\nAt this stage:\n- there&#8217;s a very high risk you could lose your vision\n- treatment&nbsp;will be offered to stabilise your vision as much as possible, although it won&#8217;t be possible to restore any&nbsp;vision you&#8217;ve lost\nIn some cases, the blood vessels in the part of the eye called the macula (the central area of the retina) can also become leaky or blocked. This is known as&nbsp;diabetic maculopathy.\nIf this is detected:\n- there&#8217;s a high risk that your vision could eventually be affected\n- you may be advised to have more frequent specialised testing to monitor your eyes\n- you may be referred to&nbsp;a hospital specialist to discuss treatments that can help&nbsp;stop the problem getting worse\nRead more about treating diabetic retinopathy\nDiabetic retinopathy usually only requires specific treatment when it reaches an advanced stage and there&#8217;s a risk to your vision.\nIt&#8217;s&nbsp;typically offered if&nbsp;diabetic eye screening&nbsp;detects stage three (proliferative) retinopathy, or if you have symptoms caused by diabetic maculopathy.\nAt all stages, managing your diabetes is crucial.\nRead about the&nbsp;stages of diabetic retinopathy&nbsp;for more information about what these terms mean.\nThe most important part of your treatment is to keep your diabetes under control.\nIn the early stages of diabetic retinopathy, controlling your diabetes can help prevent vision problems developing.\nIn the more advanced stages, when your vision is affected or at risk, keeping your diabetes under control can help stop the condition getting worse.\nRead about what you can do to reduce the risk of diabetic retinopathy progressing\nFor diabetic retinopathy that is threatening or affecting your sight, the main treatments are:\n- laser treatment&nbsp;–&nbsp;to treat the growth of new blood vessels at the back of the eye (retina) in cases of proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and to stabilise some cases of maculopathy\n- eye injections&nbsp;–&nbsp;to treat severe maculopathy that&#8217;s threatening your sight\n- eye surgery – to remove blood or scar tissue from the eye if&nbsp;laser treatment isn&#8217;t possible because&nbsp;retinopathy is too advanced\nLaser treatment is used to treat new blood vessels at the back of the eyes in the advanced stages of diabetic retinopathy. This is done because the new blood vessels tend to be very weak and often cause bleeding into the eye.\nTreatment&nbsp;can help stabilise the changes in your eyes caused&nbsp;by your diabetes and stop your vision getting any worse, although&nbsp;it won&#8217;t usually improve your sight.\nLaser treatment:\n- involves shining a laser into your eyes – you&#8217;ll be given local anaesthetic drops to numb&nbsp;your eyes; eye drops are used to widen your pupils and special contact lenses are used to hold your eyelids open and focus the laser onto your retina\n- normally takes around 20-40 minutes\n- is usually&nbsp;carried out&nbsp;on an outpatient basis, which&nbsp;means you won&#8217;t need&nbsp;to stay in hospital overnight&nbsp;\n- may&nbsp;require&nbsp;more than one&nbsp;visit to a laser treatment clinic\n- isn&#8217;t usually painful, although you may feel a sharp pricking sensation when certain areas of your&nbsp;eye are being treated\nAfter treatment, you may have some side effects for a few hours. These can include:\n- blurred vision&nbsp;–&nbsp;you won&#8217;t be able to drive until this passes, so you&#8217;ll need to arrange for a&nbsp;friend or relative to drive you home, or take public transport\n- increased sensitivity to light&nbsp;– it might help to&nbsp;wear sunglasses until&nbsp;your eyes&nbsp;have adjusted\n- aching or discomfort&nbsp;–&nbsp;over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol, should help\nYou should be told about the risks of treatment in advance. Potential complications include:\n- reduced night or peripheral (side) vision&nbsp;–&nbsp;some people may have to stop driving as a result of this\n- bleeding into the eye or&nbsp;objects floating in your vision (floaters)\n- being able to &#8220;see&#8221; the pattern made by the laser on the back of your eye&nbsp;for a few months\n- a&nbsp;small, but permanent, blind spot close to the centre of your vision\nGet medical advice if&nbsp;you notice that your sight gets worse&nbsp;after treatment.\nIn some cases of diabetic maculopathy, injections of a medicine called anti-VEGF may be given directly into your eyes to prevent new blood vessels forming at the back of the eyes.\nThe main medicines used are called ranibizumab (Lucentis)&nbsp;and aflibercept (Eylea). These can help stop the problems in your eyes getting worse, and may also lead to an improvement in your vision.\nDuring treatment:\n- the skin around your eyes&nbsp;will be cleaned and&nbsp;covered with a sheet\n- small clips will be used to keep your eyes open\n- you&#8217;ll be given local anaesthetic&nbsp;drops to numb your eyes\n- a&nbsp;very fine&nbsp;needle is carefully guided into your eyeball and the injection&nbsp;is given\nThe injections are usually given once a month to begin with. Once your vision starts to stabilise, they&#8217;ll be stopped or given less frequently.\nInjections of steroid medication may sometimes be given instead of anti-VEGF injections, or if the anti-VEGF injections don&#8217;t help.\nPossible risks and side effects of anti-VEGF injections include:\n- eye irritation or discomfort\n- bleeding inside the eye\n- floaters or a feeling of having something in your eye\n- watery or dry,&nbsp;itchy&nbsp;eyes\nThere&#8217;s also a risk that the injections could cause blood clots to form, which could lead to a heart attack or stroke. This risk is small, but it should be discussed with you before you give your consent to treatment.\nThe main risk with steroid injections is increased pressure inside the eye.\nSurgery may be carried out to remove some of the&nbsp;vitreous humour from the eye. This is&nbsp;the transparent, jelly-like substance that fills the space behind the lens of the eye.\nThe operation, known as vitreoretinal surgery, may be needed if:\n- a large amount of blood has collected in your eye\n- there&#8217;s extensive scar tissue&nbsp;that&#8217;s likely to cause, or has already caused,&nbsp;retinal detachment\nDuring the procedure, the surgeon will make a small incision in your eye before removing some of the vitreous humour, removing any scar tissue and using a laser to prevent a further deterioration in your vision.\nVitreoretinal surgery is usually carried out under local anaesthetic and sedation. This means you will not experience any pain or have any awareness of the surgery being performed.\nYou should be able to go home on the same day or the day after your surgery.\nFor the first few days, you may need to wear a&nbsp;patch over&nbsp;your&nbsp;eye.&nbsp;This is because activities such as reading and watching television can quickly tire your eye to begin with.\nYou will probably have blurred vision after the operation. This should improve gradually, although it may take several months for your vision to fully return to normal.\nYour surgeon will advise you about any activities you&nbsp;should avoid during your recovery.\nPossible risks of vitreoretinal surgery include:\n- developing a&nbsp;cataract\n- further bleeding into the eye\n- retinal detachment\n- fluid build-up in the cornea (outer layer at the front of the eye)\n- infection in the eye\nThere&#8217;s also a small chance that you will need further retinal surgery afterwards. Your surgeon will explain the risks to you.\nYou can reduce your risk of developing diabetic retinopathy, or help stop it getting worse, by keeping your blood sugar levels, blood pressure and cholesterol levels under control.\nThis can often be done by making healthy lifestyle choices, although some people will also need to take medication.\nAdopting a few lifestyle changes can improve your general health and reduce your risk of developing retinopathy. These include:\n- eating a healthy, balanced diet – in particular, try to cut down on salt, fat and sugar\n- losing weight if you&#8217;re overweight – you should aim for a BMI of 18.5-24.9\n- exercising regularly – aim to do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity, such as walking or cycling, a week; doing 10,000 steps a day can be a good way to reach this target\n- stopping smoking if you smoke\n- not exceeding the recommended alcohol limits –&nbsp;men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14&nbsp;alcohol units a week\nYou may also be prescribed medication to help control your blood sugar level (such as insulin or metformin), blood pressure (such as ACE inhibitors) and/or cholesterol level (such as statins).\nIt can be&nbsp;easier to keep your blood sugar levels, blood pressure and cholesterol levels under control if you know what level they are and monitor them regularly.\nThe lower you can keep them, the lower your chances of developing retinopathy are. Your diabetes care team can let you know what your target levels should be.\nIf you check your blood sugar level at home, it should be 4 to 10mmol/l. The level can vary throughout the day, so try to check it at different times.\nThe check done at your GP surgery is a measure of your average blood sugar level over the past few weeks. You should know this number, as it is the most important measure of your diabetes control.&nbsp;\nIt’s called HbA1c, and for most people with diabetes it should be around 48 mmol/l or 6.5%.\nRead about&nbsp;treating type 1 diabetes&nbsp;and&nbsp;treating type 2 diabetes\nYou can ask for a&nbsp;blood pressure test at your GP surgery, or you can buy a blood pressure monitor to use at home. Blood pressure is measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg) and is given as two figures.\nIf you have diabetes, you&#8217;ll normally be advised to aim for a blood pressure reading of no more than 140/80mmHg, or less than 130/80mmHg if you have diabetes complications, such as eye damage.\nRead more about high blood pressure\nYour cholesterol level can be measured with a simple blood test carried out at your GP surgery. The result is given in&nbsp;millimoles per litre of blood (mmol/l).\nIf you have diabetes, you&#8217;ll normally be advised to aim for a total blood cholesterol level of no more than 4 mmol/l.\nRead more about high cholesterol\nEven if you think your diabetes is well controlled, it&#8217;s still important to&nbsp;attend your annual diabetic eye screening&nbsp;appointment, as this can&nbsp;detect signs of a problem before you notice anything is wrong.\nThe earlier that retinopathy is&nbsp;detected, the greater the chance of effectively treating&nbsp;it and stopping it getting worse.\nYou should also contact your optician immediately if you develop any problems with your eyes or vision, such as:\n- gradually worsening vision\n- sudden vision loss\n- shapes floating in your field of vision (floaters)\n- blurred vision\n- eye pain or redness\nThese symptoms don&#8217;t necessarily mean you have diabetic retinopathy, but it&#8217;s important to get them checked out straight away."

A bowel infection (gastroenteritis) is a common cause in both adults and children.&nbsp;\nGastroenteritis can be caused by:&nbsp;\n- a virus – such as norovirus or rotavirus&nbsp;\n- bacteria – such as campylobacter and Escherichia (E. coli), which are often picked up from contaminated food&nbsp;\n- a parasite – such as the parasite that causes giardiasis, which is spread in contaminated water&nbsp;\nThese infections can sometimes be caught during travelling abroad, particularly to areas with poor standards of public hygiene. This is known as travellers&#8217; diarrhoea.&nbsp;\nDiarrhoea can also be the result of anxiety, a food allergy, medication, or a long-term condition, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\nMost cases of diarrhoea clear up after a few days without treatment.\nYou should drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration. Drink small sips of water often. It&#8217;s very important that babies and children do not become dehydrated.\nYour pharmacist may suggest you use an oral rehydration solution (ORS) if you or you child are particularly at risk of dehydration.\nYou should eat solid foods as soon as you feel able to. If you&#8217;re breastfeeding or bottle feeding your baby and they have diarrhoea, you should try to feed them as normal.\nStay at home until at least 48 hours after the last episode of diarrhoea to prevent spreading any infection to others.&nbsp;\nMedications to reduce diarrhoea, such as loperamide, are available. However, these are not usually necessary.

        "disease": "Discoid eczema",
        "description": "Discoid eczema is a long-term skin condition that causes skin to become itchy, reddened, swollen and cracked in circular or oval patches.\nIt&#8217;s also known as discoid dermatitis.\nThe patches&nbsp;can be a few millimetres&nbsp;to a few centimetres in size and can affect any part of the body, although they don&#8217;t usually affect the face or scalp.\nThe patches are often swollen, blistered (covered with small fluid-filled pockets) and ooze fluid at first, but become&nbsp;dry, crusty, cracked and flaky over time.\nThe patches may clear up on their own eventually, but this can&nbsp;take weeks, months or even years if not treated, and they can recur.\nRead more about the symptoms of discoid eczema.\nYou should see your pharmacist or GP if you think you may have discoid eczema.\nYour GP should be able to make a diagnosis just by examining the affected areas of skin. In some cases they may also ask questions or arrange some tests to rule out other conditions.\nYour GP may refer you to a dermatologist (a doctor who specialises in managing skin conditions) if they are unsure of the diagnosis or if you need patch testing.\nYour GP or specialist can recommend suitable treatments.\nThe cause of discoid eczema is unknown, although it is often accompanied by dry skin and is thought&nbsp;to be triggered by irritation of the skin.\nDiscoid eczema&nbsp;tends to affect adults and is rare in children. It is more common among men aged from 50 to 70 and women&nbsp;in their teens or twenties.\nSome people with discoid eczema may also have other types of eczema, such as&nbsp;atopic eczema.\nRead more about the causes of discoid eczema.\nDiscoid eczema is usually a long-term problem, but medications are available to help relieve the symptoms and keep the condition under control.\nTreatments used include:\n- emollients –&nbsp;moisturisers applied to the skin to stop it becoming dry\n- topical corticosteroids&nbsp;– ointments and creams applied to the skin that can help relieve severe symptoms\n- antihistamines&nbsp;– medications that can reduce itching and help you sleep better\nThere are also things you can do yourself to help, such as avoiding all the irritating chemicals in soaps, detergents, bubble baths and shower gels.\nAdditional medication can be prescribed if your eczema is infected or particularly severe.\nRead more about treating discoid eczema.\nDiscoid eczema causes distinctive circular or oval patches of eczema.\nThe patches can appear anywhere on the body, including the:\n- lower legs\n- forearms\n- trunk (torso)\n- hands\n- feet\nThe face and scalp are not&nbsp;normally affected.\nThe&nbsp;first sign of discoid eczema is&nbsp;usually a group of small red spots or bumps on the skin. These then quickly join up to form larger&nbsp;pink, red or brown patches that can range from a few millimetres to several centimetres in size.\nInitially, these patches are often swollen, blistered (covered with small fluid-filled pockets) and ooze fluid. They also tend to be very itchy, particularly at night.\nOver time, the patches may become dry, crusty, cracked and flaky.&nbsp;The centre of the patch also sometimes clears, leaving a ring of&nbsp;discoloured skin that can be mistaken for&nbsp;ringworm.\nYou may just have one patch of discoid eczema, but most people have several patches. The skin between the patches&nbsp;is often dry.\nPatches of discoid eczema can last for weeks, months or even years if not treated, and they can keeping recurring – often&nbsp;in the same area that was affected previously.\nOccasionally, areas of skin affected by discoid eczema can be left permanently discoloured after the condition has cleared up.\nPatches of discoid eczema can sometimes become infected. Signs of an infection can include:\n- the patches oozing a lot of fluid\n- a yellow crust developing over the patches\n- the skin around the patches becoming red, hot, swollen, and tender or painful\n- feeling sick\n- chills\n- a general sense of feeling unwell\nYou should see your GP or pharmacist if you think you may have discoid eczema, as the condition can take a long time to improve without treatment and it may keep recurring.\nYou should also seek medical advice if you think your skin may be infected, as you may need to use&nbsp;antibiotic cream or, in very severe cases, take antibiotics tablets.\nRead more about diagnosing discoid eczema.\nThe cause of discoid eczema is unknown, although it may occur as a result of having particularly dry skin.\nDry skin means your skin cannot provide an effective barrier against substances that come into contact with it, which could allow&nbsp;a previously harmless substance, such as soap, to irritate (damage) your skin.\nIt&#8217;s important to look carefully at all the chemicals in cosmetics and toiletries that may have come into contact with your skin.\nContact dermatitis, a type of eczema caused by coming into contact with a particular irritant, may therefore have a role in discoid eczema.\nSome people with discoid eczema also have a history of&nbsp;atopic eczema, which often occurs in people who are prone to asthma and hay fever. However, unlike atopic eczema, discoid eczema does not seem to run in families.\nAn outbreak of discoid eczema may sometimes be triggered by a minor skin injury, such as an&nbsp;insect bite or a burn.\nSome medicines may also be associated with discoid eczema, as patches of eczema can appear in people taking:\n- interferon and ribavirin – when they are used together to treat hepatitis C&nbsp;\n- tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) blockers – which are used to treat some types of arthritis\n- statins&nbsp;(cholesterol-lowering medication), which can cause dry skin and rashes\nDry environments and cold climates can make discoid eczema worse and sunny or humid (damp) environments may make your symptoms better.\nThere is no simple cure for discoid eczema, but there are medications that can help ease the symptoms.\nThese include:\n- emollients – to use all the time\n- soap substitutes – to replace irritating soaps and cleaning products\n- topical corticosteroids – for flare-ups\n- oral corticosteroids – for severe flare-ups\n- antibiotics&nbsp;– for infected eczema\n- antihistamines – for severe itching\nThere are many different preparations for each type of medication and it is worth taking time with your pharmacist to find the best one for you.\nA range of emollient products, soap substitutes and some topical corticosteroids can be bought from pharmacies without a prescription. Some of them are cheaper to buy this way than with a prescription.\nAsk your pharmacist for advice on the different products and how to use them. See your GP if your eczema does not improve after using an over-the-counter preparation.\nThere are also some self-help tips&nbsp;that may help to control symptoms of discoid eczema, such as:\n- avoiding soaps and detergents, including liquid soaps, bubble bath, shower gels and wet wipes – even if these do not obviously irritate your skin; you should use an emollient soap substitute instead\n- protecting your skin from minor cuts (for example, by wearing gloves) as they may trigger discoid eczema\n- taking daily lukewarm baths or showers – using an emollient when washing may reduce your symptoms, and remember to apply your treatments soon afterwards\n- not scratching the patches – keeping your hands clean and your fingernails short may help reduce the risk of skin damage or infection from unintentional scratching\n- making sure you use and apply your treatments as instructed by your GP or pharmacist\nIf you suspect your skin is infected, for example because there is excessive weeping or tenderness in the patches of eczema, see your GP. Infection can spread quickly, and the use of topical corticosteroid creams can mask or further spread the infection.\nEmollients are moisturising treatments applied directly to the skin to reduce water loss and cover it with a protective film. They are often used to help manage dry or scaly skin conditions such as eczema.\nSeveral different emollients are available. You may need to try a few to find one that works for you. You may also be advised to use a mix of emollients, such as:\n- an ointment for very dry skin\n- a cream or lotion for less dry skin\n- an emollient to use instead of soap\n- an emollient to add to bath water or use in the shower\n- one emollient to use on your face and hands, and a different one to use on your body\nThe difference between lotions, creams and ointments is the amount of oil they contain. Ointments contain the most oil so they can be quite greasy, but are the most effective at keeping moisture in the skin. Lotions contain the least amount of oil so are not greasy, but can be less effective. Creams are somewhere in between.\nCreams and lotions tend to be more suitable for red, inflamed (swollen) areas of skin. Ointments are more suitable for areas of dry skin that are not inflamed.\nIf you have been using a particular emollient for some time, it may eventually become less effective or may start to irritate your skin. If this is the case, your GP will be able to prescribe another product.\nUse your emollient all the time, even if you are not experiencing symptoms as they can help limit the return of your condition. Many people find it helpful to keep separate supplies of emollients at work or school.\nTo apply the emollient:\n- use a large amount\n- don&#8217;t rub it in, smooth it into the skin in the same direction that the hair grows instead\n- for very dry skin, apply the emollient every two to three hours\n- after a bath or shower, gently dry the skin and then immediately apply the emollient while the skin is still moist\nIf you are exposed to irritants at work, make sure you apply emollients regularly during and after work.\nDon&#8217;t share emollients with other people.\nOccasionally, some emollients can irritate the skin. If you have discoid eczema, your skin will be sensitive and can react to certain ingredients in over-the-counter emollients. If your skin reacts to the emollient, stop using it and speak to your GP, who can recommend an alternative product.\nEmollients added to bath water can make your bath very slippery, so take care getting in and out of the bath.\nTo treat the patches of discoid eczema, your GP may prescribe a topical corticosteroid (corticosteroid medication that is applied directly to your skin) to reduce the inflammation.\nYou may be concerned about using medication that contains steroids. However, corticosteroids are not the same as anabolic steroids, which are sometimes used by bodybuilders and athletes. When used as instructed by your pharmacist or doctor, corticosteroids are a safe and effective treatment for discoid eczema.\nThere are different strengths of topical corticosteroids that can be prescribed depending on the severity of your eczema. Discoid eczema usually needs a stronger type of corticosteroid than other types of eczema.\nYou might be prescribed a cream to be used on visible areas, such as face and hands, and an ointment to be used at night or for more severe flare-ups.\nWhen using corticosteroids, apply the treatment accurately to the affected areas. Unless instructed otherwise by your doctor, you should follow directions on the patient information leaflet that comes with the corticosteroid.\nDo not apply the corticosteroid more than twice a day. Most people will only have to apply it once a day.&nbsp;\nTo apply the topical corticosteroid, take the following steps:\n- apply your emollient first and ideally wait around 30 minutes before applying the topical corticosteroid, until the emollient has soaked into your skin\n- apply a&nbsp;good amount of the topical corticosteroid to the affected area&nbsp;&nbsp;\n- use the topical corticosteroid until the inflammation has cleared up, unless otherwise advised by your GP\nSpeak to your prescriber if you have been using a topical corticosteroid and your symptoms have not improved.\nTopical corticosteroids may cause a mild and short-lived burning or stinging sensation as you apply them. In rare cases, they may also cause:\n- thinning of the skin\n- changes in skin colour\n- acne (spots)\n- increased hair growth\nMost of these side effects will improve once treatment stops.\nGenerally, using a stronger topical corticosteroid, or using a large amount of topical corticosteroid, will increase your risk of getting side effects. For this reason, you should use the weakest and smallest amount possible to control your symptoms.\nIf you have a severe flare-up, your doctor may prescribe corticosteroid tablets to take for up to a week.\nIf corticosteroid tablets are taken often or for a long time, they can cause a number of side effects, such as:\n- reduced growth rate in children\n- high blood pressure (hypertension)\n- osteoporosis (brittle bones)\n- diabetes\nFor this reason, your doctor is unlikely to prescribe repeat courses of corticosteroid tablets without referring you to a specialist.\nIf your eczema becomes infected, you may also be prescribed an antibiotic.\nIf you have an extensive area of infected eczema, you may be prescribed an antibiotic to take by mouth. This is most commonly flucloxacillin, which is usually taken for one week. If you are allergic to penicillin, you might be given an alternative such as clarithromycin.\nIf you have a small amount of infected eczema, you will normally be prescribed a topical antibiotic, such as fusidic acid. This means&nbsp;the medicine is applied directly to the affected area of skin, in the form of an ointment or cream.\nSome topical antibiotics are available in creams or ointments that also contain topical corticosteroids.\nTopical antibiotics should normally be used for&nbsp;up to 2&nbsp;weeks as necessary.\nAntihistamines are a type of medicine that work by stopping the effects of a substance in the blood called histamine. Your body often releases histamine when it comes into contact with an irritant. Histamine can cause a wide range of symptoms, including sneezing, watery eyes and itching.\nAntihistamines may be prescribed during flare-ups of discoid eczema to cope with the symptom of itching, particularly if it is interfering with your sleep. However, they will not treat the damaged skin.\nMany older types of antihistamines can make you drowsy, which can be useful if your symptoms affect the quality of your sleep. Otherwise, ask your pharmacist or GP to recommend one of the more modern “non-sedating” antihistamines.\nIf the treatments prescribed by your GP are not successfully controlling your symptoms, they may refer you for assessment and treatment by a dermatologist (specialist in treating skin conditions).\nFurther treatments that may be available from your dermatologist include:\n- phototherapy – where the affected area of skin is exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light to help reduce inflammation\n- bandaging – where medicated dressings are applied to your skin\n- immunosuppressant therapy – medicines that reduce inflammation by suppressing your immune system"

        "disease": "Diverticular disease and diverticulitis",
        "description": "Diverticular disease and diverticulitis are related digestive conditions that affect the large intestine (colon).\nIn&nbsp;diverticular disease,&nbsp;small bulges or pockets (diverticula) develop in the lining of the intestine. Diverticulitis is when these pockets&nbsp;become inflamed or infected.\nSymptoms of diverticular disease include:\n- lower abdominal pain\n- feeling bloated\nThe majority of people with diverticula will not have any symptoms; this is known as diverticulosis.\nSymptoms of diverticulitis tend to be more serious and include:\n- more severe abdominal pain, especially on the left side\n- high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above\n- diarrhoea or frequent bowel movements\nRead more about the symptoms of diverticular disease and diverticulitis.\n&#8216;Diverticula&#8217; is the medical term used to describe the small bulges that stick out of the side of the large intestine (colon).\nDiverticula are common and associated with ageing. The large intestine becomes weaker with age, and the pressure of hard stools passing through the large intestine&nbsp;is thought to&nbsp;cause the bulges to form.\nRead more about the causes of diverticula.\nIt&#8217;s estimated that&nbsp;5% of people have diverticula by the time they are 40 years old, and at least 50% of people have them by the time they are 80 years old.\n1&nbsp;in 4&nbsp;people who develop diverticula will experience symptoms, such as abdominal pain.\nHaving symptoms associated with diverticula is known as diverticular disease.\nDiverticulitis describes infection that occurs when bacteria becomes trapped inside one of the bulges, triggering more severe symptoms.\nDiverticulitis can lead to complications, such as an abscess next to&nbsp;the intestine.\nRead more about the&nbsp;complications of diverticulitis.\nA high-fibre diet can often ease&nbsp;symptoms of diverticular disease, and&nbsp;paracetamol can be used to relieve pain&nbsp;– other painkillers such as aspirin or ibuprofen are not recommended for regular use, as they can cause stomach upsets. Speak to your GP if paracetamol alone is not working.\nMild diverticulitis can usually be treated at home with antibiotics&nbsp;prescribed by your GP. More serious cases may need hospital treatment to prevent and treat complications.\nSurgery to remove the&nbsp;affected section of the intestine is sometimes recommended if there have been serious complications, although this is rare.\nRead more about treating diverticular disease and diverticulitis.\nDiverticular disease is one of the most common digestive conditions.\nBoth sexes are equally affected by diverticular disease and diverticulitis, although the condition is more likely to appear at a younger age (under 50) in men than in women. Overall, symptoms of diverticulitis are most likely to occur in people over 70 years old.\nDiverticular disease is often described as a &#8216;Western disease&#8217; because the rates are high in European and North American countries, and low in African and Asian countries.\nA combination of genetics and diet is thought to be the reason for this and the fact that people in Western countries tend to&nbsp;eat less fibre.\nPeople aged 50 to 70 who eat a high-fibre diet (25g a day) have a 40% lower chance of admission to hospital with complications of diverticular disease – compared to others in their age range with the lowest amount of dietary fibre.\nSymptoms of diverticular disease and diverticulitis include abdominal pain, bloating and a change in normal bowel habits.\nIf diverticula have been discovered during a camera test for another reason (colonoscopy) or during a CT scan, you may be worried about what this means.\nHowever, if you have never had abdominal pain or bouts of diarrhoea, there is a 70% to 80% chance that you will never have any symptoms from them.\nDiverticula&nbsp;are&nbsp;extremely common over the age of 70 and they do not increase your risk of cancer.&nbsp;It&#8217;s thought that a high-fibre diet is likely to reduce the risk of any symptoms developing.\nThe most common symptom of diverticular disease is intermittent (stop-start) pain in your lower abdomen (stomach), usually in the lower left-hand side.\nThe pain is often worse when you are eating, or shortly afterwards. Passing stools and breaking wind (flatulence) may help&nbsp;relieve the pain.\nOther long-term symptoms of diverticular disease include:\n- a change in your normal bowel habits, such as&nbsp;constipation or diarrhoea, or episodes of constipation that are followed by diarrhoea – a classic pattern is multiple trips to the toilet in the morning to pass stools like &#8216;rabbit pellets&#8217;\n- bloating\nAnother possible symptom of diverticular disease is&nbsp;bleeding dark purple blood from your rectum (back passage). This usually occurs after diarrhoea-like cramping pain, and often leads to hospital admission, but fortunately this is&nbsp;an uncommon complication.\nDiverticular disease does not cause weight loss, so if you are losing weight, seeing blood in your stools or experiencing frequent bowel changes, see your GP.\nDiverticulitis shares&nbsp;most of the symptoms of diverticular disease (see above). However, the&nbsp;pain associated with diverticulitis is constant and severe, rather than intermittent. It is most likely to occur if you have previously had symptoms of diverticular disease, and develops over a day or 2.\nOther symptoms of diverticulitis can include:\n- a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above\n- a general feeling of being tired and unwell\n- feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting)\nThe pain usually starts below your belly button, before moving to the lower left-hand side of your abdomen.\nIn Asian people, the pain may move to the lower right-hand side of your abdomen. This is because East Asian people tend to develop diverticula in a different part of their colon for genetic reasons.\nContact your GP as soon as possible if you think you have symptoms of diverticulitis.\nIf you have symptoms of diverticular disease and the condition has previously been diagnosed, you do not usually need to contact your GP as&nbsp;the symptoms can be treated at home.&nbsp;\nRead more about the&nbsp;treatment of&nbsp;diverticular disease.\nIf you have not been diagnosed with the condition, contact your GP so they can rule out other conditions with similar symptoms, such as:\n- a stomach ulcer\n- pancreatitis\n- cholecystitis\n- bowel cancer\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) can also cause similar symptoms to diverticular disease.\nDiverticular disease is caused by small bulges in the large intestine (diverticula) developing and becoming inflamed. If any of the diverticula become infected, this leads to symptoms of diverticulitis.\nThe exact reason why diverticula develop is not known, but&nbsp;they&nbsp;are associated with not eating enough fibre.\nFibre makes your stools softer and larger, so less pressure is needed by your large intestine to push them out of your body.\nThe pressure of moving hard, small pieces of stools through your&nbsp;large intestine creates weak spots in the outside layer of muscle. This allows the inner layer (mucosa)&nbsp;to squeeze through these weak spots, creating the diverticula.\nThere is currently no clinical evidence to fully prove the link between fibre and diverticula. However, diverticular disease and diverticulitis are both much more common in Western countries, where many people do not eat enough fibre.\nIt is not known why only 1&nbsp;in 4&nbsp;people with diverticula go on to have symptoms of diverticulitis. Diverticular disease may be chronic low-level diverticulitis. The symptoms are very similar to&nbsp;irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)&nbsp;and may overlap.\nHowever,&nbsp;factors that appear to increase your risk of developing diverticular disease include:\n- smoking\n- being overweight or obese \n- having a history of constipation \n- use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)&nbsp;painkillers, such as&nbsp;ibuprofen or naproxen\n- having a close relative with diverticular disease, especially if they developed it under the age of 50\nExactly how these lead to developing diverticular disease is unclear.\nDiverticulitis is caused by an infection of one or more of the diverticula.\nIt is thought an infection develops when a hard piece of stool or undigested food&nbsp;gets trapped in one of the pouches. This gives bacteria in the stool the chance to multiply and spread, triggering an infection.\nDiverticular disease can be difficult to diagnose from the symptoms, alone because there are other conditions that cause similar symptoms, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\nAs a first step, your GP may recommend&nbsp;blood tests to rule out other conditions such as&nbsp;coeliac disease (a condition caused by an abnormal immune response to gluten) or bowel cancer.\nIn some cases, you may be offered treatment for IBS and diverticular disease at the same time.\nTo make sure there is not a more serious cause of your symptoms, your GP may refer you for a colonoscopy, where a&nbsp;thin tube with a camera at the end (a colonoscope) is inserted into your rectum and guided into your colon. Before the procedure begins, you will be given a laxative to clear out your bowels.\nA colonoscopy is not usually painful,&nbsp;but it&nbsp;can feel uncomfortable. You may be&nbsp;offered painkilling medication&nbsp;and a&nbsp;sedative beforehand to make you feel more relaxed and help&nbsp;reduce any discomfort.\nAnother technique for confirming the presence of diverticula is a computerised tomography (CT scan). A CT scan uses X-rays and a computer to create detailed images of the inside of the body.\nAs with a colonoscopy, you will be given a laxative to clear out your bowels before you have the CT scan.\nUnlike a regular CT scan, the colonography scan involves a tube being inserted into your rectum, which is used to&nbsp;pump some air&nbsp;up into your rectum. The CT scan is then taken with you lying on your front, and again lying on your back.\nYou may need to have an injection of contrast dye before the scan, but this is not always necessary.\nIf you have had a previous history of diverticular disease, your GP will usually be able to diagnose diverticulitis from your symptoms and a&nbsp;physical examination. A blood test may be taken, because a high number of white blood cells indicates infection. If your symptoms are mild, your GP will treat it at home and you should recover within 4&nbsp;days.\nFurther tests will be needed if you have no previous history of diverticular disease.\nIf you are unwell, your GP may refer you to hospital for blood tests and investigations. This is to look for complications of diverticulitis and to rule out other possible conditions, such as gallstones or a hernia.\nAn&nbsp;ultrasound scan may be used, as well as a CT scan.\nA CT scan may also be used if your symptoms are particularly severe. This is to check whether a complication, such as a perforation or an&nbsp;abscess, has occurred.\nTreatment options for diverticular disease and diverticulitis depend on how severe your symptoms are.\nMost cases of diverticular disease can be treated at home.\nThe over-the-counter painkiller paracetamol is recommended to help relieve your symptoms.\nPainkillers known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin and ibuprofen, are not recommended because they may upset your stomach and increase your risk of internal bleeding.\nEating a high-fibre diet may initially help to control your symptoms. Some people will notice an improvement after a few days, although it can take around a month&nbsp;to feel the benefits fully. Read more advice about using diet to improve the symptoms of&nbsp;diverticular disease.\nIf you&nbsp;have constipation, you may be given a bulk-forming laxative. These can cause flatulence (wind) and bloating. Drink plenty of fluids to prevent any obstruction in your digestive system.\nHeavy or constant rectal bleeding occurs in about 1 in&nbsp;20 cases of diverticular disease. This can happen if the blood vessels in your large intestine (colon) are weakened by the diverticula, making them vulnerable to damage. The bleeding is usually painless, but losing too much blood can be potentially serious and may need a blood transfusion.\nSigns that you may be experiencing heavy bleeding (aside from the amount of blood) include:\n- feeling very dizzy\n- mental confusion\n- pale clammy skin\n- shortness of breath\nIf you suspect that you (or someone in your care) is experiencing heavy bleeding, seek immediate medical advice. Contact your GP at once. If this is not possible then phone NHS 24 111 service or your local out-of-hours service.\nMild diverticulitis can often be treated at home. Your GP will prescribe&nbsp;antibiotics for the infection and you should take paracetamol for the pain.&nbsp;It&#8217;s important that you finish the complete course of antibiotics, even if you are feeling better.\nSome types of antibiotics used to treat diverticulitis can cause side effects in some people, including vomiting and diarrhoea.&nbsp;\nYour GP may recommend that you stick to a fluid-only diet for a few days until your symptoms improve. This is because trying to digest solid foods may make your symptoms worse. You&nbsp;can gradually introduce solid foods over the next 2&nbsp;or 3&nbsp;days.\nFor the 3&nbsp;to 4&nbsp;days of recovery, a low-fibre diet is suggested, until you return to the preventative high-fibre diet. This is to reduce the amount of faeces (poo) your large bowel has to&nbsp;deal with&nbsp;while it is inflamed.\nIf you have not been diagnosed with diverticular disease before, your GP may refer you for a test such as a&nbsp;colonoscopy or&nbsp;CT colonography&nbsp;after the symptoms have settled.\nIf you have more severe diverticulitis, you may need to go to hospital, particularly if:\n- your pain cannot be controlled using paracetamol\n- you are unable to drink enough fluids to keep yourself hydrated\n- you are unable to take antibiotics by mouth&nbsp;\n- your general state of health is poor\n- you have a weakened immune system\n- your GP suspects complications\n- your symptoms fail to improve after 2 days of treatment at home\nIf you are admitted to hospital for treatment, you are likely&nbsp;to receive injections of antibiotics and be kept hydrated and nourished using an intravenous drip (a tube directly connected to your vein). Most people start to improve within 2&nbsp;to 3&nbsp;days.\nIn the past, surgery was recommended as a preventative measure for people who had 2&nbsp;episodes of diverticulitis as a precaution to prevent complications.\nThis is no longer the case, as studies have found that in most cases, risks of serious complications from surgery (estimated to be around 1 in 100) usually outweigh the benefits.\nHowever, there are exceptions to this, such as:\n- if you have a history of serious complications arising from diverticulitis\n- if you have&nbsp;symptoms of diverticular disease from&nbsp;a young age (it is thought the longer you live with diverticular disease, the greater your chances of having a serious complication)\n- if you have a weakened immune system or are more vulnerable to&nbsp;infections\nIf surgery is being considered, discuss both&nbsp;benefits and risks carefully with the doctor in charge of your care.\nIn rare cases, a severe episode of diverticulitis can only be treated with emergency surgery. This is when a hole (perforation) has developed in the bowel. This is uncommon, but causes very severe abdominal pain, which needs an emergency trip to hospital.\nSurgery for diverticulitis involves removing the affected section of your&nbsp;large intestine. This is known as a colectomy. There are 2&nbsp;ways this operation can be performed:\n- an open colectomy –&nbsp;where the surgeon makes a large incision (cut) in your abdomen (stomach) and removes a section of your&nbsp;large intestine\n- laparoscopic colectomy – a type of &#8216;keyhole surgery&#8217; where the surgeon makes a number of small incisions in your abdomen and uses special instruments&nbsp;guided by a camera to remove a section of&nbsp;large intestine\nOpen colectomies and laparoscopic colectomies are thought equally effective in treating diverticulitis, and have a similar risk of complications. People who have laparoscopic colectomies tend to recover faster and have less pain after the operation.\nEmergency surgery when the bowel has perforated is more likely to be open and may result in a&nbsp;stoma being formed.\nIn some cases, the surgeon may decide your&nbsp;large intestine needs to heal before it can be reattached, or that too much of your&nbsp;large intestine has been removed to make reattachment possible.\nIn such cases, stoma surgery provides a way of removing waste materials from your body without using all of your&nbsp;large intestine. It is known as &#8216;having a bag&#8217; as a bag is stuck to the skin on your belly and the faeces (poo) are collected in the bag.\nStoma surgery involves the surgeon making a small hole in your abdomen – known as a stoma. There are 2&nbsp;ways this procedure can be carried out.\nAn ileostomy –&nbsp;where a stoma is made in the right-hand side of your abdomen. Your small intestine is separated from your&nbsp;large intestine and connected to the stoma, and the rest of the&nbsp;large intestine is sealed. You will need to wear a pouch connected to the stoma to collect waste material (poo).\nA colostomy –&nbsp;where a stoma is made in your lower abdomen and a section of your&nbsp;large intestine is removed and connected to the stoma. As with an ileostomy, you will need to wear a pouch to collect waste material.\nIn most cases, the stoma will be temporary and can be removed once your&nbsp;large intestine has recovered from the surgery. This will depend on the situation when you had the operation. If it was an emergency operation, you may need a few months to recover before having surgery to reverse the stoma.\nIf a large section of your&nbsp;large intestine is affected by diverticulitis and needs to be removed, or if you have multiple other conditions that make major surgery a risk, you may need a permanent ileostomy or colostomy.\nIn general terms, elective (non-emergency) surgery is usually successful, although it does not achieve a complete cure in all cases. Following surgery, an estimated 1 in 12 people will have a recurrence of symptoms of diverticular disease and diverticulitis.&nbsp;\nIn an emergency setting, the success rate depends on how unwell you are when you require the operation.\nComplications of diverticulitis affect 1&nbsp;in 5&nbsp;people with the condition. Those most at risk are aged under 50.\nAround 15% of people with diverticular disease or diverticulitis experience bleeding,&nbsp;which is usually painless, quick and resolves itself in 70% to 80% of cases.\nHowever,&nbsp;if the bleeding does not resolve itself,&nbsp;an emergency&nbsp;blood transfusion may be required due to excessive bleeding. If the bleeding is severe, you may need to be admitted to hospital&nbsp;for monitoring.\nDiverticulitis can lead to the inflamed part of the bowel&nbsp;being in contact with&nbsp;the bladder.&nbsp;This may&nbsp;cause urinary problems, such as:\n- pain when urinating (dysuria)\n- needing to urinate more often than usual\n- in rare cases, air in the urine\nThe most common complication of diverticulitis is an abscess outside the large intestine (colon). An abscess is a pus-filled cavity or lump in the tissue. Abscesses are usually treated with a technique known as percutaneous abscess drainage (PAD).\nA radiologist (a specialist in the use of imaging equipment, such as computerised tomography (CT) scans) uses an ultrasound or CT scanner to locate the site of the abscess.\nA fine needle connected to a small tube is passed through the skin of your abdomen (stomach) and into the abscess. The tube is then used to drain the pus from the abscess. A PAD is performed under a local anaesthetic.\nDepending on the size of the abscess, the procedure may need repeating several times before all&nbsp;the pus has been drained. If the abscess is very small – usually less than 4cm (1.5 inches) – it may be possible to treat it using antibiotics.\nA&nbsp;fistula is another&nbsp;common complication of diverticulitis. Fistulas are abnormal tunnels that connect 2&nbsp;parts of the body together, such as your intestine and your abdominal wall or bladder.\nIf infected tissues come into contact with each other, they can stick together. After the tissues have healed, a fistula may form. Fistulas can be potentially serious as they can allow bacteria in your large intestine to travel to other parts of your body, triggering infections, such as an infection of the bladder (cystitis).\nFistulas are usually treated with surgery to remove the section of the colon that contains the fistula.\nIn rare cases, an infected diverticulum (pouch in your colon) can split, spreading the infection into the lining of your abdomen (perforation). An infection of the lining of the abdomen is known as peritonitis.\nPeritonitis can be life-threatening, and requires immediate treatment with antibiotics. Surgery may also be required to&nbsp;drain any pus that has built up, and it may be necessary to perform a colostomy.\nIf the infection has badly scarred your&nbsp;large intestine, it may become partially or totally blocked. A totally blocked&nbsp;large intestine is a medical emergency because the tissue of your&nbsp;large intestine will start to decay and eventually split, leading to peritonitis.\nA partially blocked&nbsp;large intestine is not as urgent, but treatment is still needed. If left untreated, it will affect your ability to digest food and cause you considerable pain.\nIntestinal blockage from diverticular disease is very rare. Other causes, such as cancer, are more common. This is one of the reasons your GP will investigate your symptoms.\nIn some cases, the blocked part&nbsp;can be removed during&nbsp;surgery.\nHowever, if the scarring and blockage is more extensive, a temporary or permanent&nbsp;colostomy may be needed.\nEating a high-fibre diet may help prevent diverticular disease, and should improve your symptoms.\nYour diet should be balanced and include at least 5&nbsp;portions of fruit and vegetables a day, plus whole grains. Adults should aim to eat 18g (0.6oz) to 30g (1.05oz) of fibre a day, depending on their height and weight. Your GP can provide a more specific target, based on your individual height and weight.\nIt&#8217;s recommended that you gradually increase your fibre intake over the course of a few weeks. This will help prevent side effects associated with a high-fibre diet, such as bloating and flatulence (wind). Drinking plenty of fluids will also help prevent side effects.\nIf you have established diverticular disease, it may be suggested that you avoid&nbsp;eating&nbsp;nuts, corn and seeds&nbsp;due to&nbsp;the possibility that&nbsp;they could block the diverticular openings and cause diverticulitis. People usually find out themselves if these foods cause symptoms. Probiotics have also been recommended, but evidence is lacking. Overall, there is a lack of good quality scientific evidence on how to prevent diverticular disease.\nGood sources of fibre include\n- fruit\n- vegetables\n- nuts\n- breakfast cereals – but check fibre content as some are very low\n- starchy foods – such as brown bread, rice and pasta\nOnce you have reached your fibre target, stick to it for the rest of your life, if possible.\nGood sources of fibre in fresh fruit (plus the amount of fibre that is found in typical portions) include:\n- avocado pear – a medium-sized avocado pear contains 4.9g of fibre\n- pear (with skin) – a medium-sized pear contains 3.7g of fibre\n- orange – a medium-sized orange contains 2.7g of fibre\n- apple (with skin) – a medium-sized apple contains 2g of fibre\n- raspberries – 2&nbsp;handfuls of raspberries (80g) contain 2g of fibre\n- banana – a medium-sized banana contains 1.7g of fibre\n- tomato juice – 1&nbsp;small glass of tomato juice (200ml) contains 1.2g of fibre\nGood sources of fibre in dried fruit (plus the amount of fibre found in typical portions) include:\n- apricots – 3&nbsp;whole apricots contain 5g of fibre\n- prunes – 3&nbsp;whole prunes contain 4.6g of fibre\nGood sources of fibre in vegetables (plus the amount of fibre found in typical portions) include:\n- baked beans (in tomato sauce) – a half can of baked beans (200g) contains 7.4g of fibre\n- red kidney beans (boiled) – 3&nbsp;tablespoons of red kidney beans contain 5.4g of fibre\n- peas (boiled) – 3&nbsp;heaped tablespoons of peas contain 3.6g of fibre\n- French beans (boiled) – 4&nbsp;heaped tablespoons of French beans contain 3.3g of fibre\n- Brussel sprouts (boiled) – 8&nbsp;Brussel sprouts contain 2.5g of fibre\n- potatoes (old, boiled) – 1&nbsp;medium-sized potato contains 2.4g of fibre\n- spring greens (boiled) – 4&nbsp;heaped tablespoons of Spring greens contain 2.1g of fibre\n- carrots (boiled, sliced) – 3&nbsp;heaped tablespoons of carrots contain 2g of fibre\nGood sources of fibre in nuts (plus the amount of fibre found in typical portions) include:\n- almonds – 20 almonds contain 2.4g of fibre\n- peanuts (plain) – a tablespoon of peanuts contains 1.6g of fibre\n- mixed nuts – a tablespoon of mixed nuts contains 1.5g of fibre\n- Brazil nuts – 10 Brazil nuts contain 1.4g of fibre\nGood sources of fibre in breakfast cereals (plus the amount of fibre found in typical portions) include:\n- All-Bran – a medium-sized bowl of All-Bran contains 9.8g of fibre\n- Shredded Wheat – 2&nbsp;pieces of Shredded wheat contain 4.3g of fibre\n- Bran Flakes – 1&nbsp;medium-sized bowl of Bran flakes contains 3.9g of fibre\n- Weetabix – 2&nbsp;Weetabix contain 3.6g of fibre\n- muesli (no added sugar) – 1&nbsp;medium-sized bowl of muesli contains 3.4g of fibre\n- porridge (milk or water) – 1&nbsp;medium-sized bowl of porridge contains 2.3g of fibre\nNote – the &#8216;own-brand&#8217; equivalents of the cereals mentioned should&nbsp;contain similar levels of fibre.&nbsp;\nGood sources of fibre in starchy food (plus the amount found in typical portions) include:\n- crispbread – 4&nbsp;crispbreads contain 4.2g of fibre\n- pitta bread (wholemeal) – 1&nbsp;piece (75g) contains 3.9g of fibre\n- pasta (plain, fresh-cooked) – 1&nbsp;medium portion of pasta (200g) contains 3.8g of fibre\n- wholemeal bread – 2&nbsp;slices of wholemeal bread contain 3.5g of fibre\n- naan bread – 1&nbsp;piece of naan bread contains 3.2g of fibre\n- brown bread – 2&nbsp;slices of brown bread contain 2.5g of fibre\n- brown rice (boiled) – 1&nbsp;medium portion of brown rice (200g) contains 1.6g of fibre\nFibre supplements – usually in the form of sachets of powder you mix with water – are also available from pharmacists and health food shops. Some contain sweetener. A tablespoon of fibre supplement contains around 2.5g of fibre.&nbsp;If you require long-term fibre supplements, your GP can prescribe them."

        "disease": "Dry mouth",
        "description": "It&#8217;s normal to occasionally have a dry mouth if you’re dehydrated or feeling nervous. A persistently dry mouth can be a sign of an underlying problem though.\nYou have a dry mouth and:\nThe GP can check what the cause might be and recommend treatment for it.\nA dry mouth can happen when the salivary glands in your mouth do not produce enough saliva.\nThis is often the result of&nbsp;dehydration.&nbsp;This means you do not have enough fluid in your body to produce the saliva you need. It&#8217;s also common for your mouth to become dry if you&#8217;re feeling anxious or nervous.\nA dry mouth can sometimes be caused by an underlying problem or medical condition, such as:\n- medication – many different medications can cause a dry mouth including&nbsp;antidepressants, antihistamines and diuretics\n- a blocked nose – breathing through your mouth while you sleep can cause it to dry out\n- diabetes – a lifelong condition that causes a person&#8217;s blood sugar level to become too high\n- radiotherapy&nbsp;to the head and neck – this can cause the salivary glands to become inflamed (mucositis)\n- Sjögren&#8217;s syndrome&nbsp;– a condition where the immune system attacks and damages the salivary glands\nIf you contact your dentist or GP, tell them about any other symptoms you&#8217;re experiencing. Also tell them about any treatments you’re having. This will help them work out why your mouth is dry.\nSaliva plays an important role in keeping your mouth healthy. If you have a dry mouth, you may experience some other problems, such as:\n- a burning sensation or soreness in your mouth\n- dry lips\n- bad breath (halitosis)\n- a reduced or altered sense of taste\n- mouth infections that keep coming back, such as&nbsp;oral thrush\n- tooth decay&nbsp;and&nbsp;gum disease\n- difficulty speaking, eating or swallowing\nIt’s important to maintain good&nbsp;oral hygiene&nbsp;if you have a dry mouth. This can reduce the risk of dental problems. You should also see a dentist regularly, so they can identify and treat any problems early on.\nIf your doctor or dentist is able to find out what&#8217;s causing your dry mouth, treating this may help your symptoms.\nIf medication is suspected as a cause, for example, your doctor may lower your dose or suggest trying a different treatment.\nSome of the conditions mentioned have specific treatments, like:\n- nasal&nbsp;decongestants&nbsp;for a blocked nose\n- insulin for diabetes\nThere are things you can do to help relieve your symptoms.\nIf the measures above don’t help, your dentist, GP or specialist may suggest using an artificial saliva substitute. An artificial saliva substitute will help keep your mouth moist. This may come in the form of a spray, gel or lozenge. Use it as often as you need to, including before and during meals.\nIf your dry mouth is caused by radiotherapy or Sjögren&#8217;s syndrome, a medication called pilocarpine may be prescribed. This is taken as a tablet several times a day. It helps to stimulate your salivary glands to produce more saliva."

        "disease": "Dysphagia (swallowing problems)",
        "description": "Dysphagia is the medical term for swallowing difficulties.\nSome people with dysphagia have problems swallowing certain foods or liquids, while others can&#8217;t swallow at all.\nOther signs of dysphagia include:\n- coughing&nbsp;or choking when eating or drinking\n- bringing food back up, sometimes through the nose\n- a sensation that food is stuck in your throat or chest\n- persistent drooling of saliva&nbsp;\nOver time, dysphagia can also cause symptoms such as weight loss and repeated chest infections.\nYou should see your GP if you have swallowing difficulties.\nDysphagia is usually caused by another health condition, such as:\n- a condition that affects the nervous system, such as a stroke, head injury, or dementia\n- cancer&nbsp;– such as mouth cancer&nbsp;or oesophageal cancer&nbsp;\n- gastro-oesophageal reflux disease&nbsp;(GORD)&nbsp;– where stomach acid leaks back up into the&nbsp;oesophagus\nDysphagia can also occur in children&nbsp;as&nbsp;the result of a developmental or learning disability.\nDysphagia can be caused by problems with the:\n- mouth or throat, known as oropharyngeal or &#8216;high&#8217; dysphagia\n- oesophagus (the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach), known as oesophageal or &#8216;low&#8217; dysphagia\nRead more about the causes of dysphagia.\nTreatment usually depends on the cause and type of dysphagia. The type of dysphagia you have can usually be diagnosed after testing your swallowing ability and examining your oesophagus.\nMany cases of dysphagia can be improved with treatment, but a cure isn&#8217;t always possible. Treatments for dysphagia include:\n- speech and language therapy to learn new swallowing techniques&nbsp;\n- changing the consistency of food and liquids to make them safer to swallow\n- alternative forms of feeding, such as tube feeding through the nose or stomach\n- surgery to widen the narrowing of the oesophagus by stretching it or inserting a plastic or metal tube (known as a stent)\nRead more about&nbsp;diagnosing dysphagia and treating dysphagia.\nDysphagia can sometimes lead to further problems. One of the most common problems is coughing or choking when food goes down the &#8216;wrong way&#8217; and blocks your airway.\nIf this occurs frequently, you may avoid eating and drinking because you fear choking, which can lead to malnutrition and dehydration.\nSome people with dysphagia have a tendency to develop chest infections, such as aspiration pneumonia, which require medical treatment.\nDysphagia can also affect your quality of life&nbsp;as it may prevent&nbsp;you enjoying meals and social occasions.\nRead more about the&nbsp;complications of dysphagia.\nAs swallowing is a complex process, there are many reasons why dysphagia can develop.\nThe nervous system is made up of the brain, nerves and spinal cord. Damage to the nervous system can interfere with the nerves responsible for starting and controlling swallowing. This can lead to dysphagia.\nSome neurological causes of dysphagia include:\n- a stroke\n- neurological conditions that cause damage to the brain and nervous system over time,&nbsp;including Parkinson&#8217;s disease,&nbsp;multiple sclerosis, dementia,&nbsp;and motor neurone disease\n- brain tumours\n- myasthenia gravis&nbsp;– a rare condition that causes your muscles to become weak\nThe term &#8216;congenital&#8217; refers to something you&#8217;re born with. Developmental conditions affect the way you develop.\nCongenital or developmental conditions that may cause dysphagia include:&nbsp;\n- learning disabilities&nbsp;– where learning, understanding, and communicating are difficult\n- cerebral palsy&nbsp;– a group of neurological conditions that affect movement and co-ordination\n- a cleft lip&nbsp;and&nbsp;palate&nbsp;– a common birth defect that results in a gap or split in the upper lip or roof of the mouth\nConditions that cause an obstruction in the throat or a narrowing of the oesophagus&nbsp;(the tube that carries food from your mouth to the stomach)&nbsp;can make swallowing difficult.\nSome causes of obstruction and narrowing include:\n- mouth cancer or throat cancer, such as laryngeal cancer or oesophageal cancer – once these cancers are treated, the obstruction may no longer be an issue\n- pharyngeal (throat) pouches, also known as Zenker diverticulum – where a large sac develops in the upper part of the oesophagus, which reduces the ability to swallow both liquids and solids;&nbsp;it&#8217;s a rare condition that mainly affects older people\n- eosinophilic oesophagitis –&nbsp;where a type of white blood cell known as an eosinophil&nbsp;builds up in the lining of the oesophagus as the result of a reaction to foods, allergens, or acid reflux; the build-up damages the lining of the oesophagus and causes swallowing difficulties\n- radiotherapy treatment – this&nbsp;can cause scar tissue, which narrows the passageway in your throat and oesophagus\n- gastro-oesophageal reflux disease&nbsp;(GORD)&nbsp;– stomach acid can cause scar tissue to develop, narrowing your oesophagus&nbsp;\n- infections, such as tuberculosis or thrush – these can lead to inflammation of the oesophagus (oesophagitis)\nAny condition that affects the muscles used to push food down the oesophagus and into the stomach can cause dysphagia,&nbsp;although&nbsp;such conditions are rare.\n2&nbsp;muscular conditions associated with dysphagia are:\n- scleroderma&nbsp;– where the immune system (the body&#8217;s natural defence system) attacks healthy tissue, leading to a stiffening of the throat and oesophagus muscles\n- achalasia – where muscles in the oesophagus lose their ability to relax and open to allow food or liquid to enter the stomach\nAs you get older, the&nbsp;muscles&nbsp;used for swallowing can become weaker. This may explain why dysphagia is relatively common&nbsp;in elderly people. Treatment is available to help people with age-related dysphagia.\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease&nbsp;(COPD) is a collection of lung conditions that make it difficult to breathe in and out properly. Breathing difficulties can sometimes affect your ability to swallow.\nDysphagia can also sometimes develop as a complication of head or neck&nbsp;surgery.\nSee your GP if you&#8217;re having any difficulty swallowing. They&#8217;ll carry out an initial assessment and may refer you for further tests and treatment.\nTests will help determine whether your dysphagia is the result of a problem with your mouth or throat (oropharyngeal, or &#8216;high&#8217; dysphagia), or your oesophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach (oesophageal, or &#8216;low&#8217; dysphagia).\nDiagnosing the specific type of dysphagia can make treatment more effective and reduce your chances of developing complications of dysphagia, such as choking or pneumonia.\nYour GP will want to know:\n- how long you&#8217;ve had dysphagia\n- whether your symptoms come and go, or are getting worse\n- whether dysphagia has affected your ability to swallow solids, liquids, or both\n- whether you&#8217;ve lost weight\nDepending on the suspected cause,&nbsp;you may be referred for further tests with:&nbsp;\n- an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist&nbsp;\n- a speech and language therapist (SLT)\n- a neurologist&nbsp;– a specialist in conditions that affect the brain, nerves, and spinal cord\n- a gastroenterologist&nbsp;– a specialist in treating conditions of the gullet, stomach, and intestines\n- a geriatrician – a specialist in the care of elderly people\nA water swallow test&nbsp;is usually carried out by a speech and language therapist, and&nbsp;can&nbsp;give a good initial assessment of your swallowing abilities. You&#8217;ll be given 150ml of water and asked to swallow it as quickly as possible.\nThe time&nbsp;it takes you to drink all of the water and the number of swallows required will be recorded. You may also be asked to swallow a soft piece of pudding or fruit.\nA videofluoroscopy, or modified barium swallow, is one of the most effective ways of assessing your swallowing ability and finding exactly where the problem is.\nAn X-ray&nbsp;machine records a continuous moving X-ray on to video, allowing your swallowing problems to be studied in detail.\nYou&#8217;ll be asked to swallow different types of food and drink of different consistencies, mixed with a non-toxic liquid called barium that shows up on X-rays.\nA videofluoroscopy usually takes about 30 minutes. You may feel sick after the test, and the barium may cause constipation. Your stools may also be white for a few days as the barium passes through your system.\nA nasendoscopy, sometimes also known as fibreoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES),&nbsp;is a procedure that allows the nose and upper airways to be closely examined using&nbsp;a very small flexible tube known as an endoscope.\nThe endoscope is inserted into your nose so the specialist can look down on to your throat and upper airways. It has a light and camera at the end so images of the throat can be viewed on a television screen. This allows any blockages or problem areas to be identified.\nFEES can also be used to test for oropharyngeal dysphagia after you&#8217;re asked to swallow a small amount of test liquid (usually coloured water or milk).\nBefore the procedure, you may have local anaesthetic spray into your nose, but because the camera doesn&#8217;t go as far as your throat, it doesn&#8217;t cause retching. The procedure is safe and usually only takes a few minutes.\nManometry is a procedure to assess the function of your oesophagus. It involves passing a small&nbsp;tube (catheter) with pressure sensors through your nose and into your oesophagus to monitor its function.\nThe test measures the pressures&nbsp;within your&nbsp;oesophagus when you swallow, which determines how well it&#8217;s working.\nThe 24-hour pH study involves inserting a tube into your oesophagus through your nose to measure the amount of acid that flows back from your stomach. This&nbsp;can help determine the cause of any swallowing difficulties.\nDiagnostic gastroscopy, also known as diagnostic endoscopy of the stomach,&nbsp;or oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD), is an internal examination using an endoscope.\nThe endoscope&nbsp;is passed down your throat and into your oesophagus, and images of the inside of your body are transmitted to a television screen. It can often detect cancerous growths or scar tissue.\nRead more about treating dysphagia.\nIf dysphagia has affected your ability to eat, you may need a nutritional assessment to check that you&#8217;re not lacking nutrients (malnourished). This could involve:\n- measuring your weight\n- calculating your&nbsp;body mass index (BMI) to check whether you&#8217;re a healthy weight for your height&nbsp;\n- carrying out&nbsp;blood tests\nMost swallowing problems can be treated, although the treatment you receive will depend on the type of dysphagia you have.\nTreatment will depend on whether your swallowing problem is in the mouth or throat (oropharyngeal, or &#8216;high&#8217; dysphagia), or in the oesophagus (oesophageal, or &#8216;low&#8217; dysphagia).\nThe cause of dysphagia is also considered when deciding on treatment. In some cases, treating the underlying cause, such as mouth cancer or oesophageal cancer,&nbsp;can help relieve swallowing problems.\nTreatment for dysphagia may be managed by a&nbsp;group of specialists known as a multidisciplinary team (MDT). Your MDT may include&nbsp;a speech and language therapist (SLT), a surgeon, and a dietitian.\nHigh dysphagia is swallowing difficulties caused by problems with the mouth or throat.\nIt can be difficult to treat if it&#8217;s caused by a condition that&nbsp;affects the nervous system.&nbsp;This is because these problems can&#8217;t usually be corrected using medication or surgery.\nThere are 3&nbsp;main treatments&nbsp;for high dysphagia:\n- swallowing therapy\n- dietary changes&nbsp;\n- feeding tubes\nYou may be referred to a speech and language therapist (SLT) for swallowing therapy if you have high dysphagia.\nAn SLT is a healthcare professional trained to work with people with feeding or swallowing difficulties.\nSLTs use a range of techniques that can be tailored&nbsp;for your specific problem, such as&nbsp;teaching you swallowing exercises.\nYou may be referred to a dietitian (specialist in nutrition)&nbsp;for advice about changes to your diet to make sure&nbsp;you receive a healthy, balanced diet.\nAn SLT&nbsp;can give you advice about&nbsp;softer foods and thickened fluids that you may find easier to swallow. They may also try to ensure you&#8217;re getting the support you need at meal times.\nFeeding tubes can be used to provide nutrition while you&#8217;re recovering your ability to swallow. They may also be required in severe cases of dysphagia that put you at risk of malnutrition and dehydration.\nA feeding tube&nbsp;can also make it easier for you to take the medication you may need for other conditions.\nThere are 2&nbsp;types of feeding tubes:\n- a nasogastric tube – a tube that is passed down your nose and into your stomach\n- a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube –&nbsp;a tube that is implanted directly into your stomach\nNasogastric tubes are designed for short-term use. The tube will need to be replaced and swapped to the other nostril after about a month. PEG tubes are designed for long-term use and last several months before they need to be replaced.\nMost people with dysphagia prefer to use a PEG tube because it can be hidden under clothing. However, they carry a greater risk of complications compared&nbsp;with nasogastric tubes.\nMinor complications of PEG tubes include tube displacement, skin infection, and a blocked or leaking tube. 2&nbsp;major complications of PEG tubes are infection and internal bleeding.\nResuming normal feeding may be more difficult with a PEG tube compared with using a nasogastric tube. The convenience of PEG tubes can make people less willing to carry out swallowing exercises and dietary changes than those who&nbsp;use nasogastric tubes.\nYou should discuss the pros and cons of both types of feeding tubes with your treatment team.\nLow dysphagia is swallowing difficulties&nbsp;caused by&nbsp;problems with the oesophagus.\nDepending on the cause of low dysphagia, it may be possible to treat it with medication. For example, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) used to treat indigestion may improve symptoms caused by narrowing or scarring of the oesophagus.&nbsp;\nBotulinum toxin&nbsp;can sometimes be used to treat achalasia. This is a condition where the muscles in the oesophagus become too stiff to allow food and liquid to enter the stomach.\nIt can be used to paralyse the tightened muscles that prevent food from reaching the stomach. However, the effects only last for around 6&nbsp;months.\nOther cases of low dysphagia can usually be treated with surgery.\nEndoscopic dilation is widely used to treat dysphagia caused by obstruction. It&nbsp;can also be used to stretch your&nbsp;oesophagus if it&#8217;s scarred.\nEndoscopic dilatation will be carried out during an&nbsp;internal examination of your oesophagus (gastroscopy)&nbsp;using an endoscopy.\nAn endoscope is passed down your throat and into your&nbsp;oesophagus, and&nbsp;images of the inside of your body are transmitted to a television screen.\nUsing the image as guidance, a small balloon or a bougie (a thin, flexible medical instrument) is passed through the narrowed part of your oesophagus to widen it. If a balloon is used, it will be gradually inflated to widen your oesophagus before being deflated and removed.\nYou may be given a mild sedative before the procedure to relax you. There&#8217;s a small risk that the procedure could cause a tear or perforate your oesophagus.\nIf you have&nbsp;oesophageal cancer&nbsp;that can&#8217;t be removed, it&#8217;s usually recommended that you have a&nbsp;stent inserted instead of endoscopic dilatation. This is because, if you have cancer,&nbsp;there&#8217;s a higher risk of perforating your oesophagus if it&#8217;s stretched.\nA stent (usually a metal mesh tube)&nbsp;is inserted&nbsp;into your&nbsp;oesophagus during an endoscopy or under X-ray&nbsp;guidance.\nThe stent then gradually expands to create a passage wide enough to allow food to pass through. You&#8217;ll need to follow a particular diet to keep the stent open without having&nbsp;blockages.\nIf your baby is born with difficulty swallowing (congenital dysphagia), their treatment will depend on the cause.\nDysphagia caused by cerebral palsy&nbsp;can be treated with speech and language therapy. Your child will be taught how to swallow, how to adjust the type of food they eat, and how to use feeding tubes.&nbsp;\nCleft lip and palate&nbsp;is a facial birth defect that can cause dysphagia. It&#8217;s usually treated with surgery.&nbsp;\nNarrowing of the oesophagus may be treated with a type of surgery called dilatation to widen the oesophagus.&nbsp;\nDysphagia caused by&nbsp;gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)&nbsp;can be treated using special thickened feeds instead of your usual breast or formula milk. Sometimes medication may also be used.\nIf you&#8217;re having difficulty bottle feeding or breastfeeding your baby, see your midwife, health visitor or GP.\nThe main complication of dysphagia is coughing and choking, which can lead to pneumonia.\nIf you have dysphagia, there&#8217;s a risk of food, drink or saliva going down the &#8216;wrong way&#8217;. It can block your airway, making it difficult to breathe and causing you to cough or choke.\nRead more information and advice about what to do if someone is choking.\nIf you have dysphagia, you may also develop a fear of choking. However, it&#8217;s very important you don&#8217;t avoid eating and drinking, as it could cause dehydration and malnutrition.\nIf you often choke on your food&nbsp;because of&nbsp;dysphagia, you may also be at an increased risk of developing a&nbsp;condition called aspiration pneumonia.\nAspiration pneumonia is a chest infection that can develop after accidentally inhaling something, such as a small piece of food. It causes irritation in the lungs, or damages them. Older people are particularly at risk of developing aspiration pneumonia.\nThe symptoms of aspiration pneumonia include:\n- a cough – this may be a dry&nbsp;cough, or you may produce phlegm that&#8217;s yellow, green, brown, or bloodstained\n- a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or over\n- chest pain\n- difficulty breathing – your breathing may be rapid and shallow and you may feel breathless, even at rest\nContact your treatment team immediately if you&#8217;re being treated for dysphagia and you develop these symptoms. If this isn&#8217;t possible, contact your local out-of-hours service or phone NHS 24 111 service.\nSymptoms of aspiration pneumonia can range from mild to severe, and it is usually treated with antibiotics. Severe cases will require hospital admission and treatment with intravenous antibiotics (through a drip). Read more about&nbsp;treating pneumonia.\nIn particularly old or&nbsp;frail people, there&#8217;s a chance the infection could lead to their lungs becoming filled with fluid, preventing them working properly. This is known as&nbsp;acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\nYour chances of developing pneumonia as a result of&nbsp;dysphagia are higher if you have&nbsp;a weakened immune system,&nbsp;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or if your oral and dental hygiene is poor.\nIf children with long-term dysphagia&nbsp;aren&#8217;t eating enough, they may not get the essential nutrients they need for physical and mental development.\nChildren who have difficulty eating may also find meal times stressful, which may lead to behavioural problems."

        "disease": "Dystonia",
        "description": "Dystonia is a neurological movement disorder. People with dystonia experience involuntary muscle spasms and contractions.\nMovements are often repetitive and cause unusual, awkward and sometimes painful postures. Tremor (shaking) is often associated with some types of dystonia.\nDystonia can be a condition on its own (primary dystonia). Some people experience dystonia as a symptom of another condition (secondary dystonia).\nSymptoms of dystonia can include:\n- uncontrolled muscle spasms\n- parts of your body twisting into unusual positions – like your neck being pulled to the side or your feet turning inwards\n- shaking (tremors)\n- excessive blinking\nThe symptoms may be continuous or come and go. They may be triggered by voluntary movements.\nThere are different types of dystonia.\nGeneralised dystonia affects all parts of the body.\nIf you have focal dystonia, only one muscle group is affected.\nThe most common type of focal dystonia is neck dystonia, also known as cervical dystonia. This usually causes the head to be pulled in one direction. This can then affect movement and cause pain.\nOther types of focal dystonia can impact:\n- your voice (laryngeal dystonia)\n- the muscles around your eyes (blepharospasm)\n- limbs (like writer’s cramp)\nDystonia is thought to be caused by a problem with the part of the brain that controls movement.\nPrimary and secondary dystonia may have different underlying causes.\nPrimary dystonia often begins in childhood. This type of dystonia is more likely to have a recognised genetic cause.\nYou might experience dystonia as a symptom of another condition.\nSecondary dystonia might be caused by:\n- Parkinson’s disease\n- cerebral palsy\n- certain medications (like some antipsychotics and some anti sickness medications)\n- injury to the brain\n- stroke\nIf your GP thinks you have dystonia, they may refer you to a specialist neurologist.\nYou may need to have tests to confirm whether you have primary or secondary dystonia.\nDepending on your symptoms, you might have a blood test or scan.\nThere are treatments that can control the involuntary movements and spasms of dystonia.\nYou might need to try several treatment options to find out which one works best.\nIf you have focal dystonia, you might be offered botulinum toxin.\nBotulinum toxin is injected into the affected muscles. It blocks the neurotransmitters within the nerve, reducing muscle spasms.\nThe effects of the injection can last from around 3 months to 6 months.\nOral medications, like tablets, can be effective for some people with generalised dystonia.\nThe following are medications which might be used to treat dystonia:\n- anticholinergics\n- baclofen\n- muscle relaxants\nDepending on the type of dystonia you have, physiotherapy might help you improve your range of movement.\nYou might have surgery if your dystonia symptoms don&#8217;t improve with other treatments.\nDeep brain stimulation (DBS) is a type of brain surgery. It&#8217;s offered to some people with dystonia where other treatments haven&#8217;t been successful.\nThe surgeon will place a small device, like a pacemaker, under the skin of your chest or tummy.\nThe device sends electrical signals along wires placed in the part of the brain that controls movement.\nIt&#8217;ll be several weeks or months before you begin to feel the benefit of DBS.\nRead more about deep brain stimulation"

        "description": "Self Help Guide\nLast Updated: \nNext Review Date: \nSearch for a service near you by entering your postcode below.\nPlease input your postcode in the following format: A12 1BC\nNHS inform has more information on this condition.\nYou said:  \nBased on the information you gave us, we made the following recommendation: \nEarache is a common problem, particularly in children. It can be worrying, but it’s usually only caused by a minor infection and will often get better in a few days without treatment.\nEarache can be a sharp, dull or burning ear pain that comes and goes or is constant. One or both ears may be affected.\nComplete our self-help guide to check your symptoms and find out what to do next.\nYou do not always need to see a GP as earache will usually get better on its own within a few days.\nSpeak to your pharmacist for advice and treatment if you have earache. Your pharmacist may recommend that you speak to your GP practice if required.\nYou or your child have earache and:\nIf your GP practice is closed, phone 111.\nYou or your child:\nIf you or your child has an ear infection, you should avoid putting objects in the ear, such as cotton buds, or getting the affected ear wet.\nIf the cause of earache is an ear infection, there may be a watery or pus-like fluid coming out of the ear.\nOuter ear infections (infections of the tube connecting the outer ear and eardrum) and middle ear infections (infections of the parts of the ear behind the eardrum) are very common causes of earache.\nMany ear infections clear up on their own without treatment in a few days or weeks, but in some cases your GP may prescribe eardrops or antibiotics.\nGlue ear (also known as otitis media with effusion, or OME) is a build-up of fluid deep inside the ear, which commonly causes some temporary hearing loss. The condition tends to be painless, but sometimes the pressure of this fluid can cause earache.\nGlue ear will often clear up on its own, although this can take a few months. If the problem is persistent, a minor procedure to place small tubes called grommets in the ear may be recommended to help drain the fluid.\nRead more about glue ear\nEarache can sometimes result from injury to the inside of the ear. For example, by scraping earwax from the ear canal using a cotton bud, or poking a cotton bud too far into your ear, which can puncture the eardrum.\nThe ear canal is very sensitive and can easily become damaged. The ear should heal on its own without treatment, but it can take up to 2 months for a perforated eardrum to heal. If you have a perforated eardrum, eardrops shouldn’t be used.\nA build-up of earwax or an object stuck inside the ear can sometimes cause earache.\nIf there is something in your or your child’s ear that seems be causing pain, don’t attempt to remove it yourself. You may push it further inside and you may damage the eardrum.\nIf you have a build-up of earwax in your ear, your pharmacist will be able to recommend eardrops to soften it so it falls out naturally. In some cases, your GP will organise for removal of the wax (once softened with eardrops) by flushing the ear with water. This is known as ear irrigation.\nIf there is an object in the ear, your GP may need to refer you or your child to a specialist to have it removed.\nIf you find it painful to swallow and you have a sore throat, your earache could be a symptom of a throat infection such as tonsillitis or quinsy. Quinsy is an abscess on the back of your throat, which can sometimes make it very difficult to swallow.\nSome types of tonsillitis will clear up after a few days without the need for antibiotics. But if you have quinsy, you will need to see your GP as soon as possible for treatment. You may have quinsy if your sore throat gets worse very quickly.\nEarache is occasionally caused by a problem with the joint of your jaw bone (where the jaw meets the skull). This is known as temporomandibular joint pain and can be caused by problems such as arthritis or teeth grinding.\nJaw pain can often be treated with painkillers, warm or cold compresses, and trying not to clench your jaw and grind your teeth.\nA dental abscess is a collection of pus that can form in your teeth or gums as a result of a bacterial infection. The main symptom is pain in your affected tooth, which can be intense and throbbing, although the pain can sometimes spread to your ear.\nIf you think you may have a dental abscess, make a dentist appointment as soon as possible. They may need to remove the abscess and drain the pus.\nRead more about treating dental abscesses"

        "disease": "Early miscarriage",
        "description": "An early miscarriage is the loss of your pregnancy before the 12th week of pregnancy. This is the most common type of miscarriage.\nA miscarriage between 12 and 24 weeks is known as a late miscarriage.\nThe signs of early miscarriage can be mistaken for normal symptoms of pregnancy. They can include:\n- vaginal bleeding\n- stomach pain or cramping\n- pregnancy symptoms suddenly stopping\nExperiencing these miscarriage symptoms does not mean that you&#8217;re definitely having an early miscarriage. But, you should speak with your GP, local early pregnancy service or 111 if you&#8217;re concerned.\nVaginal bleeding can vary. It may be light spotting or brown discharge. It can also be a heavier bleed that&#8217;s similar to (or heavier than) your normal period.\nLight bleeding and spotting before 12 weeks of pregnancy is common. It&#8217;s often not a sign of miscarriage. But you should always seek help if you have bleeding at any point in your pregnancy, whether or not you&#8217;re in pain. Contact your maternity unit, phone 111, or self-refer to an early pregnancy unit.\nIf you&#8217;re bleeding, use a clean sanitary pad or period pants. Do not use tampons or period cups. They can increase the risk of infection.\nIt’s a good idea to monitor the bleeding and make a note of what it&#8217;s like, so you can tell your doctor, nurse or midwife. Think about how much there is, what colour it is, and whether there are any big lumps or clots.\nIt&#8217;s not unusual to experience some stomach pain or light cramps in early pregnancy. They can be caused by:\n- your uterus (womb) expanding\n- your ligaments stretching as your bump grows\n- hormones\n- constipation\n- trapped wind\nHowever, cramping and pain in your lower abdomen (tummy) may be a sign of miscarriage. If you&#8217;re concerned about any pain, contact your maternity unit, phone 111, or self-refer to an early pregnancy unit.\nIf you have a miscarriage, you may find your pregnancy symptoms disappear. For example, you stop feeling sick, or find your breasts are no longer tender.\nHowever, these symptoms can also disappear after your first trimester.\nIf you&#8217;re concerned about your pregnancy symptoms stopping, contact your maternity unit, phone 111, or self-refer to an early pregnancy unit.\n&nbsp;\nIf your GP is closed, phone NHS 24 on 111.\nIt&#8217;s not always possible to tell why a miscarriage happened. It’s unlikely to be caused by anything you did or did not do.\nRead more about the causes of miscarriage\nThere&#8217;s no way to stop a miscarriage once it has started. But there are different treatments available to help manage your miscarriage. The treatment you&#8217;re offered will depend on what type of miscarriage you&#8217;re having.\nThe doctor, nurse or midwife treating you will use an ultrasound scan to confirm what type of miscarriage you&#8217;re having.\nIn a complete miscarriage, the pregnancy comes away from the womb by itself.\nOnce confirmed, you&#8217;ll not need to stay in hospital. You&#8217;ll be able to manage your symptoms at home.\nYou&#8217;ll be given advice on over-the-counter painkillers. It&#8217;s normal to bleed for up to 3 weeks after a miscarriage. This means you&#8217;ll need extra-absorbent sanitary products. External sanitary products, like pads or period pants, are recommended. Internal sanitary products, like tampons, increase the risk of infection.\nIt&#8217;s recommended that you take a pregnancy test 2-3 weeks after your miscarriage. This will make sure that it&#8217;s complete.\nA missed miscarriage happens when you&#8217;ve lost your pregnancy without showing any symptoms. With a missed miscarriage, there&#8217;s a risk that pregnancy tissue is left in the womb.\nAn incomplete miscarriage is when some of your pregnancy is left in your womb.\nIf pregnancy tissue is left in the womb, it can cause infection and make you very unwell.\nThere are 3 options for managing a missed or incomplete miscarriage. Those treating you will talk with you about your options. You&#8217;ll be given time to consider what you&#8217;d like to do.\nYou may wish to have someone with you at this time. This is possible for all types of management, though they may not be able to be with you during surgery if you need or decide on surgical management. Those caring for you will discuss this with you.\nThe 3 options are expectant management, medical management and surgical management.\nExpectant management is when you wait for the miscarriage to finish by itself. This happens in about half of people who have expectant management.\nYou don’t need to stay in hospital for expectant management, but it can take some time for the bleeding to start.\nYou&#8217;ll be given contact details of who to contact if:\n- you have any concerns about your health or the progress of your miscarriage\n- you change your mind about your management option\nYou&#8217;ll also be given information about what you can do with your baby&#8217;s remains.\nYou&#8217;ll be offered prescription painkillers or be given advice on over-the-counter painkillers.\nWhen your miscarriage does start, you’ll feel cramping pain. This may be intense. You&#8217;ll bleed heavily and pass large clots.\nSeek medical advice immediately if:\n- you soak through more than 2 heavy flow sanitary pads per hour, for 3 hours in a row\n- you develop a high temperature (fever)\n- you have severe pain or cramping that you cannot manage with pain relief\nYou’ll be asked to take a pregnancy test after 3 weeks. You may also be offered an ultrasound to check all pregnancy tissue has come away. If the treatment has not worked, you may be offered:\n- continued expectant management\n- medical management\n- surgical management\nExpectant management might not be recommended to you if:\n- you have an increased risk of haemorrhage (severe bleeding)\n- you&#8217;re at increased risk from the effects of haemorrhage (severe bleeding), like if you’re unable to have a blood transfusion\n- you have an infection\nDuring medical management you&#8217;ll be given 2 tablets to take. These are called mifepristone and misoprostal. These tablets help the pregnancy tissue to come away from your uterus (womb).\nMedical management is effective in 85 out of 100 people.\nYou&#8217;ll take mifepristone first. This blocks the hormones that allow pregnancy to continue. 36 to 48 hours after taking mifepristone, you’ll take a dose of misoprostol.\nA few hours after taking misoprostol, you&#8217;ll start bleeding.\nIt’s normal to experience some pain after taking misoprostol. Different people have different experiences, but people often:\n- have cramps that are more intense than your usual period\n- have heavy bleeding\n- pass blood clots\nThe pregnancy sac will pass with the clots.\nYou&#8217;ll be offered pain relief and anti-sickness medication. You may also be able to take ibuprofen or paracetamol up to the recommended safe dose. A hot water bottle or heat pack can also provide some relief.\nIn most cases, you’ll be able to go home while you wait for the miscarriage to complete.\nSeek medical advice immediately if:\n- you soak through more than 2 heavy flow sanitary pads per hour, for 3 hours in a row\n- you develop a high temperature (fever)\n- you&#8217;ve severe pain or cramping that you cannot manage with pain relief\nYou’ll be asked to take a pregnancy test after 3 weeks. If the treatment has not worked, you may be offered more further medical management. You may also be offered surgical management.\nSurgical management means having surgery to remove the pregnancy. It&#8217;s effective in 95 out of 100 people.\nDuring the operation you&#8217;ll be given an anaesthetic. This may be a local anaesthetic, which numbs the area involved but leaves you awake. It may also be a general anaesthetic, which means you&#8217;ll be asleep for the procedure.\nAfter the anaesthetic has worked, your cervix will be gently opened with a small tube. Any remains of your pregnancy will then be removed with a suction device.\nThe surgery is safe, but like any operation, there is a small risk of complications. These include:\n- heavy bleeding\n- infection\n- damage to the womb\nYou should be able to go home the same day, once you&#8217;ve recovered from the anaesthetic.\nYou&#8217;ll be given advice on over-the-counter painkillers.\nIt&#8217;s normal to bleed for up to 3 weeks after a miscarriage. This means you&#8217;ll need extra-absorbent sanitary products. External sanitary products, like pads or period pants, are recommended. Internal sanitary products, like tampons, increase the risk of infection.\nIf your GP practice is closed, phone NHS 24 on 111.\nYou may be advised to have surgical management immediately if:\n- you&#8217;re bleeding heavily and continuously\n- there are signs of infection\n- medicine to remove the pregnancy has been tried without success\nMiscarriage, no matter when it happens, can be a very upsetting experience.\nIt may take some time to recover, physically and emotionally. It’s important to take the time you need. But if you are struggling to cope, talk to your GP. They&#8217;ll help you get more support.\nRead more about coping after a miscarriage"

        "disease": "Earwax build-up",
        "description": "Earwax is made inside your ears to keep them clean. It usually falls out on its own. Sometimes too much can build up and block the ears.\nA build-up of earwax is a common problem. It can often be treated using eardrops bought from a pharmacy.\nA build-up of earwax in your ear can cause:\n- earache\n- hearing loss\n- tinnitus (hearing sounds from inside your body)\n- itchiness in or around the ear\n- ear infections\nThese problems will usually get better once the build up of earwax has been removed.\nDo not try to remove a build-up of earwax yourself with your fingers, a cotton bud or any other object. This can damage your ear and push the wax further down.\nIf the earwax is only causing minor problems, you can try buying some eardrops from a pharmacy. Using drops may make your hearing or symptoms a little worse at first before getting better. These can help soften the earwax so that it falls out naturally.\nThere are several different types of eardrops you can use, including drops containing:\n- sodium bicarbonate\n- olive oil\n- almond oil\nEardrops aren’t suitable for everyone and some can irritate the skin. You shouldn’t use eardrops if you have a hole or tear in your eardrum.\nSpeak to your pharmacist about the right product for you and make sure you read the leaflet that comes with it.\nYour GP or practice nurse will look inside your ears to check if they’re blocked. They might carry out some simple hearing tests.\nIf pharmacy treatment doesn’t work, speak to your GP practice.\nTreatments may include:\n- ear irrigation – a quick and painless procedure where an electric pump is used to push water into your ear and wash the earwax out\n- microsuction – a quick and painless procedure where a small device is used to suck the earwax out of your ear (you may need to be referred for this)\nThese treatments are not suitable for everyone. Your doctor can discuss this with you.\nIf these treatments don’t help, your GP may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist.\nSome people regularly get blocked ears because they naturally produce a lot of earwax.\nOther causes include:\n- producing naturally hard or dry earwax\n- having narrow or hairy ear canals (the tube between the opening of the ear and the eardrum)\n- being elderly, as earwax becomes drier with age\n- bony growths in the outer part of the ear canal\nEarwax can also block your ear if you often insert objects into your ear, such as cotton buds, ear plugs or hearing aids."

        "disease": "Ebola virus disease",
        "description": "Ebola virus disease is a serious illness that originated in Africa, where a large outbreak occurred in 2014&nbsp;to 2015.&nbsp;In June 2016, the outbreak was officially declared over.\nThe 2014&nbsp;to 2015 outbreak of Ebola mainly affected 3 countries in west Africa: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Some cases also occurred in parts of central Africa.\nAround 28,000 cases and more than 11,000 deaths were reported by the World Health Organization. This was the largest known outbreak of Ebola.\nThere&#8217;s still a small chance occasional cases of Ebola may occur in Africa as the virus is present in several countries there, but the risk for people travelling to Africa is minimal.\nPeople who remain most at risk are those who care for infected people or handle their blood or fluid, such as hospital workers, laboratory workers and family members.\nTo find out what the health risks are for an area you&#8217;re planning to visit, check the&nbsp;NHS Fit for Travel destination guide, Travel Health Pro country information&nbsp;or GOV.UK foreign travel advice.\nThe risk of an Ebola outbreak occurring in the UK remains negligible.\nA person infected with Ebola virus will typically develop:\n- a high temperature (fever)\n- a&nbsp;headache\n- joint and muscle pain\n- a&nbsp;sore throat\n- severe muscle weakness\nThese symptoms start suddenly between&nbsp;2 and 21 days after becoming infected.\nDiarrhoea, vomiting, a rash,&nbsp;stomach pain and reduced kidney and liver function can follow. The person may then bleed internally, and may also bleed from the ears, eyes, nose or mouth.\nGet medical advice as soon as possible if you become ill while travelling abroad. Phone 111 or contact your GP if you become ill after returning to the UK.\nIt&#8217;s extremely unlikely you have Ebola, but it could be another serious condition such as&nbsp;cholera or&nbsp;malaria, so it&#8217;s a good idea to get help in case you need tests or treatment.\nAlways remember to mention your recent travel history, as this will help identify what the problem could be.\nSometimes your doctor may want to take a sample of your blood, urine or stools so it can be checked for any infections.\nThe Ebola virus is spread in the blood, body fluids or organs of a person or animal with the infection.\nFor example, it can be spread by:\n- directly touching the body of someone with the infection who has symptoms or&nbsp;recently died – the virus can survive for several days outside the body\n- cleaning up body fluids (blood, stools, urine or vomit) or touching the soiled clothing of an infected person\n- handling unsterilised needles or medical equipment used in the care of the infected person\n- having sex with an infected person without using a condom – studies show traces of Ebola may remain in a man&#8217;s semen many months after he has recovered\n- handling or eating raw or undercooked &#8216;bushmeat&#8217;\nEbola can&#8217;t be caught through routine social contact, such as shaking hands, with people who don&#8217;t have symptoms.\nThere&#8217;s currently no licensed treatment or vaccine for Ebola. Potential new vaccines and drug therapies are being developed and tested.\nAny area affected by an outbreak should be immediately quarantined, and people confirmed to have the infection should be treated in isolation in intensive care.\nDehydration&nbsp;is common, so fluids may be given directly into a vein. Blood oxygen levels and blood pressure also need to be maintained at the right level, and body organs supported while the person&#8217;s body fights the infection.\nHealthcare workers need to avoid contact with the bodily fluids of their infected patients by taking strict precautions, such as wearing protective equipment.\nEbola virus disease is sometimes&nbsp;fatal. The sooner a person is given care, the better the chance they&#8217;ll survive.\nFollow these simple precautions to minimise your risk of picking up potentially serious infections.\nYou can check the advice for an area you&#8217;re planning to visit using the&nbsp;NHS Fit for Travel destination guide, Travel Health Pro country information&nbsp;or GOV.UK foreign travel advice."

        "disease": "Ectopic pregnancy",
        "description": "An ectopic pregnancy happens when a fertilised egg implants in the wrong place. An ectopic pregnancy is almost always unable to survive. Cases where an ectopic pregnancy survives have been reported, but they are exceptionally rare.\nAbout 1 in 80 pregnancies are ectopic. Like any pregnancy loss, an ectopic pregnancy can be deeply upsetting. You may need some time to recover emotionally as well as physically.\nAfter an egg is released by the ovary, it travels along a fallopian tube. There, it can meet a sperm and becomes fertilised.\nAfter fertilisation, it should continue along the fallopian tube into the uterus (womb). Usually, a fertilised egg will then implant in the uterus and start to develop.\nIn an ectopic pregnancy, the fertilised egg either does not reach or does not stop in the uterus. Instead, it implants somewhere it cannot fully develop.\nIn most ectopic pregnancies, the fertilised egg implants in one of the fallopian tubes. Less commonly, the fertilised egg implants in the ovary, cervix, or abdomen. It can also implant in a caesarean scar, or other places in within the womb wall.\nEctopic pregnancy can be life-threatening. Even though it&#8217;s in the wrong place, the egg will still try to develop and get bigger. As it gets bigger, an ectopic pregnancy can rupture (burst), causing damage and internal bleeding. If this happens, a person can lose a lot of blood into their abdomen (tummy) before starting to experience symptoms.\nThe signs of an ectopic pregnancy can vary from person to person, and will depend on where the ectopic pregnancy is.\nSymptoms are commonly experienced around the 6th to 7th week of pregnancy. But, they can appear anywhere between 4 and 12 weeks of pregnancy.\nSymptoms of an ectopic pregnancy might include:\n- pain in your lower abdomen (tummy) &#8211; this might come on quickly or gradually, and can be widespread or on one side only\n- vaginal bleeding &#8211; this might be like your normal period or it may be lighter or heavier or darker than normal\n- upset stomach\n- sudden diarrhoea\n- pain when you pee, that may feel like a urinary tract infection (UTI)\n- pain when you poo, or in your back passage\n- new pain in the tip of your shoulder\nRead more about ectopic pregnancy symptoms\nContact your GP or your local early pregnancy service. If your GP is closed, contact NHS 24 on 111.\nIn an emergency situation, an ectopic pregnancy will be diagnosed quickly. You&#8217;ll receive treatment straight away.\nIf you only have mild symptoms, diagnosing an ectopic pregnancy can take a little longer. Your doctor, nurse or midwife will run tests to see if your pregnancy is ectopic. These tests may include:\n- a pregnancy test, if you&#8217;ve not already done one\n- a physical examination of your abdomen (tummy)\n- a transvaginal ultrasound scan, where a slim ultrasound probe is inserted into your vagina for an internal scan\nMost ectopic pregnancies are diagnosed with a transvaginal ultrasound scan. However, it&#8217;s quite common for your first ultrasound scan will not show where your pregnancy is. This is called having a pregnancy of unknown location (PUL). It can mean that:\n- your pregnancy is not in the right place, but hasn&#8217;t been found\n- your pregnancy is in the right place, but is too small to be seen on an ultrasound\n- you&#8217;ve had an early miscarriage\nYou&#8217;ll be offered blood tests to look for changes in your pregnancy hormones, and may be asked to come back for further ultrasound scans. In these cases, you&#8217;ll usually be diagnosed within 4 days. In rarer cases, it can take a few weeks of follow up for your diagnosis.\nThe treatment you&#8217;re offered will depend on different things, including:\n- how many weeks pregnant you are\n- your symptoms\n- your test results\nYour doctor, nurse or midwife will discuss your options with you, and what it might mean for your health and fertility (ability to get pregnant) in the future. They&#8217;ll work with you to plan your treatment.\nIf your fallopian tube ruptures, you&#8217;ll be offered emergency surgery. This is because you&#8217;re at high risk of severe bleeding, which could be life-threatening. There&#8217;s no other way to treat a ruptured fallopian tube.\nThere are 3 different treatments for ectopic pregnancies that are not an emergency. Depending on your circumstances, you may be offered:\n- expectant management\n- medical treatment\n- surgical treatment\nExpectant management is when you wait and see if the ectopic pregnancy ends by itself. Your doctor, nurse or midwife will use your hormone levels to decide if this is a safe option for you. They&#8217;ll also continue to monitor your hormone levels to make sure it remains a safe option for you.\nIf the ectopic pregnancy does end by itself, you&#8217;re likely to have some bleeding. You should use external period products (like pads) rather than internal period products (like tampons) at this time. This reduces the risk of infection.\nIf expectant management is not effective, you&#8217;ll be offered other options.\nIn some cases, an ectopic pregnancy may be treated by medication. You&#8217;ll receive an injection of a drug called methotrexate. This drug stops the ectopic pregnancy from growing.\nIt&#8217;s most likely that you&#8217;ll only need 1 injection of methotrexate. However, 15% of people who have methotrexate will need a second injection.\nThere&#8217;s a chance you&#8217;ll still need surgical treatment if this doesn&#8217;t work. This is more likely if your pregnancy is further along, or if your pregnancy hormone levels are high.\nAfter the injection, you may need to return to the clinic or ward for blood tests. This is to make sure that the pregnancy has ended.\nIf you have any bleeding after the pregnancy has ended, you should use external period products (like pads) rather than internal period products (like tampons) at this time. This reduces the risk of infection.\nIf this treatment is effective, you&#8217;ll not need to have surgery.\nAn ectopic pregnancy that needs emergency treatment will always require surgery. But surgery is also a treatment option for non-emergency cases.\nThere are 2 types of surgery for ectopic pregnancy. Both types of surgery will remove the ectopic pregnancy.\nWhere possible, surgeons will use keyhole surgery (also called a laparoscopy). In this type of surgery, the surgeons use a tiny camera to work inside your body. This means they only need to make a small cut in your abdomen (tummy).\nIn some cases, like if there&#8217;s internal bleeding, the surgeons may need to make a larger cut. This is called open surgery, or a laparotomy.\nThe type of operation you&#8217;ll be offered will depend on:\n- the urgency of your surgery\n- the damage that your ectopic pregnancy may have caused\n- your plans for a future pregnancy\nSometimes keyhole surgery has to change to open surgery. This can happen for a number of reasons.\nIf your ectopic pregnancy is in the fallopian tube, it is likely that the tube will be damaged. This means your surgeon will need to remove it. This can help to reduce the risk of you having another ectopic pregnancy in the future.\nHaving an ectopic pregnancy does not mean that you&#8217;re unable to have a successful pregnancy in the future. Even if you&#8217;ve had a fallopian tube removed, you have a good chance of getting pregnant again. Your remaining fallopian tube will be able to &#8220;pick up&#8221; an egg from the opposite ovary.\nIt&#8217;s recommended to wait for a while after an ectopic pregnancy before you try to get pregnant again. You should wait:\n- 3 to 6 months after medical management, following the advice of your doctor or midwife\n- until you&#8217;ve had 2 periods after surgical treatment\nIn both cases, you should also wait until you feel emotionally ready to try again.\nAs soon as you know you&#8217;re pregnant, contact your local maternity service. Let them know that you&#8217;ve previously had an ectopic pregnancy. They may offer you additional scans to make sure that the pregnancy is in the right place.\nYou may feel grief and loss, and you may also feel anxiety about getting pregnant again.\nRead more about coping after you&#8217;ve lost a baby\nRead more about getting pregnant again after ectopic pregnancy\nIf you feel you need further support after the loss, talk to your GP. They will be able to offer further guidance on support options."

        "disease": "Elbow (radial head or neck) fracture",
        "description": "Your injury may be referred to as a fracture, break or crack. These terms all mean the same thing.\nWhen you have a fracture, it&#8217;s not just the bone that&#8217;s affected. You&#8217;ll also have injured some of the soft tissues around it. Soft tissues include the:\n- muscles\n- ligaments\n- tendons\n- nerves\nA fracture heals between 3 to 6 weeks after the injury.\nIt&#8217;s normal to have aches and discomfort beyond 3 to 6 weeks. This often happens when you try activities you haven’t done for a while.\nIt&#8217;s also normal for the area to be more sensitive for a while after the injury.\nThere are some things that might affect your recovery.\nSmoking affects all your tissues and slows facture healing times. In some people, it can stop healing altogether.\nStopping smoking as your fracture heals will help to ensure the best recovery.\nGet help to stop smoking.\nSome medical conditions, like diabetes, may slow down the healing.\nEating a healthy diet and keeping yourself active will help your recovery.\nSome medications can slow down fracture healing. If you have concerns about your medication, talk to a healthcare professional.\nAnti-inflammatory medication, like Ibuprofen or Naproxen, has been shown to delay healing.\nThis type of elbow fracture is stable and you can move your joint without causing damage.\nAt first, your elbow will feel stiff and painful. However, it&#8217;s important to continue to move it, even if it hurts.\nYou may be given a collar and cuff or sling for pain relief only. It&#8217;s important that you reduce the use of this as your pain improves to prevent your elbow from becoming stiff. The aim is to stop wearing this support as soon as possible, ideally within a week.\nIt&#8217;s normal to have some discomfort in the areas around your fracture, including:\n- other soft tissues\n- nearby joints\n- areas that have been immobilised\nPain can change from day to day and it doesn’t always depend on what you&#8217;re doing. It&#8217;s common to have pain at rest.\nIt&#8217;s normal to have some pain even when your fracture has healed. Some people also experience discomfort in the fracture site during colder weather.\nYour local pharmacy can give you advice on managing pain after a fracture.\nUse Scotland&#8217;s Service Directory to find your local pharmacy.\nSwelling is the start of healing. It&#8217;s normal to have swelling near the fracture. It can then spread down your arm.\nThe swelling changes with:\n- your position\n- activity\n- the time of day\nEven when your fracture has healed it&#8217;s normal to have some swelling. This can last for several months.\nHaving a lot of swelling can become uncomfortable or limit your movement. However, there are some things you can do to reduce the swelling. You can try to:\n- raise your arm above your heart when resting – you can do this by supporting your elbow with pillows\n- keep the other joints in your hand or arm moving normally\n- avoid too much rest or too much activity\n- massage the swelling\nIt&#8217;s normal to have bruising after a fracture.\nBruising can be widespread and may appear a long way from your fracture. It can be very purple to start with and may change colour as you recover.\nThere are some things you should consider when trying to get back to your normal activities.\nYou should contact your insurance provider before driving. Your injury may affect your insurance.\nOnce you&#8217;re out of your sling, the general advice is that you must be able to perform an emergency stop or manoeuvre safely.\nYou should always be in full control of your vehicle.\nYour return to work will depend on the type of work you do and your employer. It may be possible to discuss a phased return to work or changed duties.\nYou don’t need to see a healthcare professional to return to work.\nIt can take 6 weeks for a radial head or neck fracture to heal completely. During this time, don&#8217;t stress the joint with heavy lifting or weight-bearing.\nDon&#8217;t return to contact sports until:\n- at least 6 weeks after your injury\n- you&#8217;re pain-free when moving\nHowever, keep doing any activities you&#8217;re able to and where your pain allows. Over time, gradually increase what you do.\nReduced flexibility and strength may make things more difficult to start with. This will get better as you slowly build up to all your usual activities.\nFrustration or low mood after an injury is normal. As you get back to normal life this should get better.\nLoss of confidence is common after a fracture.\nGet advice about preventing falls.\nYou may be sent a letter inviting you for a scan of your bone density after a fracture.\nIt&#8217;s routine to be assessed for any further risk of fracture, especially if you:\n- are over the age of 50\n- have increased risk factors for fracture\nThere are movements you can do to help each stage of your recovery\nJust after your injury, you should:\n- maintain your shoulder wrist and hand movements\n- increase movement in your elbow with gentle exercises\n- manage your pain and swelling\nBetween 3 to 6 weeks after your injury, you should:\n- continue your elbow exercises, making sure you&#8217;re aiming for full movement\n- pay particular attention to straightening your elbow and turning your palm upwards &#8211; you can add gentle pressure from your other hand to stretch out these movements\nThe injury should be healed between 6 to 12 weeks but heavy tasks may cause discomfort.\nYou should aim to:\n- return to full function\n- resume normal day to day activity\n- return to higher impact activity\n- try exercises to regain elbow movement\nIt&#8217;s important to start exercises as soon as possible after an injury. This will help your recovery and help you to regain normal function.\nConsider other parts of your arm when moving, like your fingers, wrist and shoulder. There is nothing wrong with them so don&#8217;t let them stiffen as well. Keep all parts moving.\nExercises should be practiced for 3 to 5 minutes every hour. It&#8217;s better to do movements little and often, than to do them once a day for a longer period.\nIf your&nbsp;elbow&nbsp;function hasn’t improved within 6 weeks of following this advice, it’s a good idea to talk to a healthcare professional about your symptoms.\nThe elbow does 4 movements. It turns your hand palm up and palm down. It can also straighten and bend so that your hand touches your shoulder.\nYou should try exercises that practise these movements.\nStop these exercises if they make your symptoms worse, or cause new pain."

        "disease": "Edwards’ syndrome",
        "description": "Edwards&#8217; syndrome (also known as trisomy 18) is a genetic condition that begins to affect babies when they&#8217;re in the womb, and continues to impact their health throughout their life. It&#8217;s a rare but serious condition.\nIn the UK, around 3 in every 10,000 births are affected by Edwards’ syndrome.\nWhen a baby is conceived (made), they inherit genetic material from both their parents. This genetic material is called a chromosome.\nHumans normally have 23 pairs of chromosomes. In each pair, 1 of the chromosomes is inherited from the mother and 1 is inherited from the father.\nIf a baby has Edwards&#8217; syndrome, they have inherited an extra copy of chromosome 18. This extra copy can be present in some or all of the baby&#8217;s cells and can lead to health problems for the baby.\nThere are 3 different forms of Edwards&#8217; syndrome:\nIn full form Edwards&#8217; syndrome, the baby has inherited a complete extra copy of chromosome 18. This extra copy is present in all of the baby&#8217;s cells.\nAround 94% of babies born with Edwards’ syndrome have the full form of the syndrome.\nIn mosaic form Edwards&#8217; syndrome, the baby has inherited a complete extra copy of chromosome 18, but the copy is only present in some of the baby&#8217;s cells.\nIn partial form Edwards&#8217; syndrome, the baby has only inherited part of an extra copy of chromosome 18. This is a very rare form of Edwards&#8217; syndrome.\nMost cases result from a random change in the egg or sperm in healthy parents. This change is not caused by anything the parents did before or during pregnancy.\nYou’ll be offered&nbsp;screening for Edward&#8217;s syndrome&nbsp;when you&#8217;re between 11 and 14 weeks pregnant.\nThe screening test will show if your baby has a high or low chance of having Edwards&#8217; syndrome.\nIf screening shows that there&#8217;s a high chance your baby has Edwards&#8217; syndrome, you can choose to have a further diagnostic test if you wish.\nIf you receive a very high chance result (between &#8220;1 in 2&#8221; and &#8220;1 in 10&#8221; for Edwards&#8217; syndrome, this may affect your options for further screening. This is because NIPT is less accurate if you&#8217;ve received a very high chance result for Edwards&#8217; syndrome or Patau&#8217;s syndrome. Your healthcare professional will discuss the next options with you.\nNo test can tell if your baby has full, mosaic or partial Edward&#8217;s syndrome or how they&#8217;ll be affected.\nAround 7 in 10 (70%) of pregnancies diagnosed with Edwards’ syndrome from screening tests will end in&nbsp;miscarriage&nbsp;or&nbsp;stillbirth.\nThe risk of miscarriage decreases as the pregnancy progresses, but there&#8217;s still a risk of stillbirth.\nIf your baby is affected by Edwards&#8217; syndrome, it is likely they will have associated health conditions (other conditions often found in babies with Edwards&#8217; syndrome). Some of these may be serious. Exactly how your baby is affected will depend on the form of Edwards&#8217; syndrome they have.\nFull form Edwards&#8217; syndrome is considered to be a life-limiting condition. This means it can affect how long a baby can live.\nAround 5 in 10 (52.5%) will live longer than 1 week. Around 1 in 10 (12.3%) will live longer than 5 years.\nBabies born with full form Edwards&#8217; syndrome will have a learning disability which may be severe. They&#8217;re also likely to have a wide range of health conditions, some of which can be serious. Statistically:\n- around 9 in 10 (90%) will have heart issues\n- around 5 in 10 (50%) will have seizures\n- around 5 in 10 (50%) will have hearing loss\n- around 5 in 10 (50%) will have joint contractures (shortening of muscle tissue that can cause a deformity)\n- around 1 in 10 (10%) will have a cleft lip and/or palate\nCurrently we can&#8217;t predict how babies with mosaic or partial forms of Edwards&#8217; syndrome will be affected. This is because it depends on:\n- how many cells contain the extra chromosome (mosaic)\n- how much of the extra chromosome they have (partial)\nSome babies may have severe health problems like those seen in full form Edwards&#8217; syndrome. Other babies may have much less serious health issues. There are even cases where the baby seems to have no health issues at all.\nMany babies with the mosaic form of Edwards&#8217; syndrome will have some form of learning disability and developmental delay (when a child takes longer to start doing certain activities, like walking and talking, than other children their age).&nbsp;\nThe life expectancy for babies with mosaic or partial forms of Edwards’ syndrome is also very variable. Some will live long lives, while others will have a much shorter life expectancy.\nEach child is unique, and Edwards’ syndrome will affect each child differently. Like all children they&#8217;ll have their own personalities, likes and dislikes, and things that make them who they are.\nBabies with full form Edwards&#8217; syndrome usually have a low birthweight and are considered &#8220;medically fragile&#8221;. This means they are at high risk of infections and complications that require treatment in hospital. They may also:\n- have difficulty feeding and may need fed by a tube\n- have difficulty breathing and have apnoea (pauses in their breathing)\nDespite their complex needs, children with Edwards’ syndrome can make progress with their development, although slowly.\nMany children are reported to be able to communicate their needs, show awareness of surroundings, and some can sit and stand supported. There are also cases of older children attending school.\nFeedback from many parents suggests that children with Edwards&#8217; syndrome have a good quality of life and are valued members of the family.\nBabies with Edwards&#8217; syndrome are included in the secure congenital and rare condition (CARDRISS) register. The register is maintained by Public Health Scotland.\nThe register records how many babies have this condition, and some relevant personal information.\nIt&#8217;s also used to support the planning and improvement of health, care, and other public services.\nRead more about CARDRISS\nYou can find out more information about Edwards’ syndrome, including stories from parents of a child with the syndrome, at&nbsp;SOFT UK (Support Organisation for Trisomy 13/ 18)"

        "disease": "Epilepsy",
        "description": "Epilepsy is a condition that affects the brain and is defined by repeated seizures.\nEpilepsy affects more than 600,000 people in the UK. Almost one in every 100 people has the condition.\nThe main symptoms of epilepsy are repeated seizures. There are different types of seizure, depending on which part of the brain it affects.\nThe cells in the brain, known as neurons, conduct electrical signals. They communicate with each other in the brain using chemical messengers. During a seizure, there are abnormal bursts of neurons firing off electrical impulses. This can cause the brain and body to behave strangely.\nThe severity of seizures can differ from person to person. Some people experience an odd feeling with no loss of awareness, or may have a &#8220;trance-like&#8221; state for a few seconds or minutes. Others lose consciousness and have convulsions (uncontrollable shaking of the body).\nSome people might only have a single seizure. If they do not have a high risk of having further seizures, they would not be regarded as having epilepsy.\nIf you see someone having a seizure, there are some things you can do to help. It will not usually be necessary to call an ambulance after a seizure.\nIf you&#8217;re with someone who has a seizure:\n- protect them from injury by removing any dangerous or potentially harmful objects nearby\n- cushion their head with your hands or soft material\n- do not restrain them or attempt to move them (unless they are in immediate danger)\n- do not put anything in their mouth\n- stay calm, and stay with them until they regain consciousness\nWhen the convulsions have stopped, put them into the&nbsp;recovery position&nbsp;until they&#8217;ve recovered.\nStatus epilepticus is the name for any seizure that lasts longer than 5 minutes, or a series of seizures where the person does not regain consciousness in between. This is a medical emergency and requires treatment as soon as possible.\nYou can be trained to treat status epilepticus if you care for someone with epilepsy. It&#8217;s important to phone 999 for an ambulance immediately if you suspect status epilepticus.\nIf you&#8217;ve been trained to treat the condition, you&#8217;ll usually have been advised to use either:\n- a medication called buccal midazolam that comes in liquid form and is given by trickling the liquid onto the inside of the person&#8217;s cheek or up their nose (this is the most common immediate treatment)\n- a medication called diazepam that&#8217;s placed in the person&#8217;s rectum (less commonly used)\nIf you&#8217;ve tried one of these treatments and the seizures are continuing, phone 999 for an ambulance.\nPeople with epilepsy can experience any type of seizure, although most people have a consistent pattern of symptoms.\nSeizures can occur when you&#8217;re awake or asleep.\nThe type of seizure depends on how much of the brain it affects. There are:\n- focal (or partial) seizures – where only a small part of the brain is affected\n- generalised seizures – where most or all of the brain is affected\nSome seizures do not fit into these categories and are known as unclassified seizures.\nThere are two main types of focal seizure.\nFocal aware seizures are where you remain fully conscious throughout.\nSymptoms of a focal aware seizure can include:\n- a general strange feeling that is hard to describe\n- a &#8220;rising&#8221; feeling in your tummy – sometimes likened to the sensation in your stomach when on a fairground ride\n- an intense feeling that events have happened before (déjà vu)\n- experiencing an unusual smell or taste\n- a tingling sensation, or &#8220;pins and needles&#8221;, in your arms and legs\n- a sudden intense feeling of fear or joy\n- stiffness or twitching in part of the body, such as an arm or hand\nThese seizures are sometimes known as &#8220;warnings&#8221; or &#8220;auras&#8221;, because they can be a sign that another type of seizure is on its way. This can give you time to warn people around you and make sure you&#8217;re in a safe place.\nFocal impaired awareness seizures are when you lose your sense of awareness. You won’t remember what happened after this type of seizure.\nThe symptoms of a focal impaired awareness seizure can involve random bodily behaviour, like:\n- smacking your lips\n- rubbing your hands\n- making random noises\n- moving your arms around\n- picking at clothes\n- fiddling with objects\n- adopting an unusual posture\n- chewing or swallowing\nDuring a focal impaired awareness seizure, you’ll not be able to respond to anyone else. You’ll usually have no memory of it.\nThere are 6 main types of generalised seizure.\nAbsence seizures&nbsp;mainly&nbsp;affect children, but they also occur in adults. They cause the person to lose awareness of their surroundings, usually for up to 15 seconds. The person will seem to stare&nbsp;vacantly&nbsp;into space. Some people will flutter their eyes or smack their lips. The person will have no memory of the seizure.\nAbsences can occur several times a day. They may affect a child&#8217;s performance at school. They can be dangerous if they occur at a critical time, like crossing a busy road.\nThese types of seizures cause your arms, legs or upper body to jerk or twitch, as if you have received an electric shock. They often only last for a fraction of a second, and you&#8217;ll normally remain conscious during this time.\nMyoclonic jerks often happen in the first few hours after waking up. They can occur in combination with other types of generalised seizures.\nThese cause the same sort of twitching as myoclonic jerks, except the symptoms will last longer, normally up to 2 minutes. You might lose consciousness during a clonic seizure.\nAtonic seizures cause all your muscles to relax suddenly. There&#8217;s a chance you may fall to the ground and you could injure yourself.\nTonic seizures cause all your muscles to suddenly become stiff. You might lose balance and fall over. Like atonic seizures, there&#8217;s a risk of injury.\nTonic-clonic seizures or convulsions have 2 stages. Your body will initially become stiff and then your arms and legs will begin twitching. You&#8217;ll lose consciousness and some people will wet themselves. The seizure normally lasts a minute, but can last longer.\nThis type of seizure is what most people think of as an epileptic fit.\nMyoclonic-tonic-clonic seizures and Myoclonic-atonic are seizures involving a combination of the generalised seizures above.\nIn some cases of epilepsy a cause cannot be found.\nIf there&#8217;s an identifiable cause, it usually involves the brain being affected by a condition.\nThe brain is a delicate mix of nerve cells, electrical impulses and chemicals, known as neurotransmitters. Any damage has the potential to disrupt the workings of the brain and cause seizures.\nThe categories of epilepsy can be separated by their causes which might be:\nCauses of structural epilepsy can include:\n- cerebrovascular disease (problems with the blood vessels that supply the brain) – such as a&nbsp;stroke&nbsp;or subarachnoid haemorrhage\n- brain tumours\n- severe head injuries\nA genetic abnormality can cause epilepsy. Research has found more genetic causes of epilepsy.\nSometimes epilepsy is hereditary (passed on from one or both parents) or it can be a new gene abnormality.\nInfections like&nbsp;meningitis&nbsp;can cause damage to the brain which can result in epilepsy. Viral infections like HIV can also cause epilepsy.\nSometimes epilepsy is caused by an imbalance of the bodies chemicals. This is very rare.\nAutoimmune conditions that cause encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) can cause someone to develop epilepsy.\nIn many cases, no cause of epilepsy is found. This may be because medical investigations are not advanced enough to identify the cause.\nFor many people with epilepsy, seizures can occur without any obvious trigger. However, certain circumstances or the use of certain substances can sometimes come before a seizure. These include:\n- stress\n- lack of sleep\n- withdrawal from alcohol following heavy drinking\n- some medications\n- illegal drugs\n- your&nbsp;menstrual cycle or period\n- flashing lights (this is an uncommon trigger that affects less than 5% of people with epilepsy, and is known as photosensitive epilepsy)\nKeeping a seizure diary is a good way to help find out what might trigger your seizures. Every time you have a seizure, record it and make a note of what you were doing. Over time, you might notice some avoidable things that seem to trigger your symptoms.\nEpilepsy is usually difficult to diagnose quickly. In most cases, it cannot be confirmed until you have had more than one seizure.\nIt can be difficult to diagnose because many other conditions, like fainting,&nbsp;migraines&nbsp;and&nbsp;panic attacks, can cause similar symptoms.\nIf you&#8217;ve had a seizure, you&#8217;ll be referred to a specialist in epilepsy. This will normally be a neurologist (a doctor who specialises in conditions affecting the brain and nervous system).\nSome of the most important pieces of information needed to diagnose epilepsy are the details about your seizures.\nThe doctor will ask you what you can remember and any symptoms you may have had before it happened&nbsp;&#8211; things like feeling strange before the seizure or experiencing any warning signs. It is extremely useful to talk to anyone who seen your seizure and ask them exactly what they saw, especially if you cannot remember.\nThe doctor will also ask about your medical and personal history. They&#8217;ll ask whether you use any medicines, drugs or alcohol.\nThe doctor may be able to make a diagnosis of epilepsy from the information you give. They might run further tests like an electroencephalogram (EEG) or&nbsp;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.\nEven if these tests don&#8217;t show anything, it&#8217;s still possible that you have epilepsy based on your symptoms and description of your seizures.\nAn&nbsp;MRI scan&nbsp;is a type of scan which uses strong magnetic fields to produce detailed images of the inside of your body.\nIt can be useful in cases of suspected epilepsy. It can often detect possible causes of the condition, such as defects in the structure of your brain.\nAn EEG test can detect unusual brain activity associated with epilepsy. It measures the electrical activity of your brain through electrodes placed on your scalp.\nDuring the test, you may be asked to breathe deeply or close your eyes and you may be asked to look at a flashing light. The test will be stopped immediately if it looks like the flashing light could trigger a seizure.\nIn some cases, an EEG may be carried out while you&#8217;re asleep (sleep EEG). Or you may be given a small, portable EEG recording device to monitor your brain activity over 24 hours (ambulatory EEG).\nYou might be asked to come into the hospital for a few days to have a video telemetry and EEG. During this, an EEG and video will be used to monitor you.\nMost people with epilepsy can be successfully treated with anti-seizure medication (ASMs). ASMs do not cure epilepsy, but can prevent seizures from occurring.\nThere are many different ASMs. They work by changing the levels of the chemicals in your brain that conduct electrical impulses. This reduces the chance of a seizure.\nThe type of ASM recommended for you will depend on a number of factors like:\n- the type of seizures you have\n- your age\n- whether there are any concerns about a certain ASM interacting with other medicines (like the&nbsp;contraceptive pill)\n- whether you&#8217;re thinking of having a baby\nExamples of commonly used ASMs include sodium valproate, carbamazepine, lamotrigine and levetiracetam.\nASMs are available in different forms, including tablets, capsules, liquids and syrups.\nIt&#8217;s important you follow any advice about when to take ASMs and how much to take. Never suddenly stop taking an ASM because it could cause a seizure.\nYou shouldn&#8217;t take any other medicines whilst taking ASMs without speaking to your GP or epilepsy specialist. This includes over-the-counter medicines or complementary medicines such as St John&#8217;s Wort. Other medicines could have a dangerous interaction with your ASM and cause a seizure.\nSodium valproate is not usually prescribed for women of childbearing age. This is because it could cause&nbsp;a baby to have physical defects or developmental problems.\nIt can be used if there is no alternative, or if your specialist has assessed you and it&#8217;s unlikely you&#8217;ll respond to or tolerate other treatments. Your specialist or GP will also need to check you&#8217;re using a reliable form of contraception. Learn more about the&nbsp;risks of valproate medicines during pregnancy.\nSide effects are common when starting treatment with ASMs. They&#8217;re usually short-lived and pass in a few days.\nSpeak to your healthcare team for more information on the side effects.\nIf your epilepsy is still poorly controlled after trying treatment with ASMs, you may be referred to a specialist epilepsy centre. They&#8217;ll assess if you&#8217;re suitable for surgery.\nThis involves having various types of brain scans to find out where the epilepsy is focused. Memory and psychological tests will assess how the surgery might affect you.\nSurgery is only recommended when:\n- a single area of the brain is causing seizures (focal seizures)\n- removing that part of the brain would not cause any significant loss of brain function\nMost people recover from the effects of surgery after a few days. But it could be several months before you&#8217;re feeling fit and able to return to work.\nYour doctor might suggest an alternative procedure if:\n- your epilepsy is still poorly controlled after trying treatment with ASMs\n- brain surgery is not suitable for you\nThis might be vagus nerve stimulation (VNS).\nVNS involves surgically implanting a small electrical device under your skin, near your collarbone. The device is like a&nbsp;pacemaker.\nThe device has a wire that&#8217;s wrapped around one of the nerves in the left side of your neck, known as the vagus nerve. The device passes a regular dose of electricity to the nerve to stimulate it. This can help reduce the frequency and severity of seizures.\nIf you feel the warning sign of a seizure coming on, you can activate an extra &#8220;burst&#8221; of stimulation. This might prevent the seizure from occurring. The stimulation normally occurs every five minutes and lasts for 30 seconds.\nHow and why VNS works is not fully understood. It&#8217;s thought that stimulating the vagus nerve alters the chemical transmissions in the brain.\nMost people who undergo VNS still need to take ASMs.\nThe battery for the VNS device typically lasts up to 10 years. After 10 years you&#8217;ll need another procedure to replace it.\nA ketogenic diet is a diet high in fats and low in carbohydrates and protein. It&#8217;s thought that it may make seizures less likely by altering the chemical composition of the brain.\nA ketogenic diet is sometimes advised for children with seizures that are difficult to control and have not responded to ASMs. This is because it&#8217;s reduces the number of seizures in some children. It should only be used under the supervision of an epilepsy specialist with the help of a dietitian.\nIt can also be effective in adults with certain types of epilepsy.\nRegular exercise and a healthy diet are recommended for everyone. They can help prevent many conditions, including&nbsp;heart disease&nbsp;and many forms of&nbsp;cancer.\nTry to eat a balanced diet, containing all the food groups, to give your body the nutrition it needs. Exercising regularly can increase the strength of your bones, relieve stress and reduce fatigue.\nAlcohol can also interact with anti-seizure medication (ASMs). ASMs can heighten the effects of alcohol. Alcohol also can make the side effects of ASMs worse and make the medication less effective.\nHeavy drinking can disrupt your sleep patterns. This increases your chances of having a seizure. Drinking no more than the&nbsp;recommended daily limits&nbsp;may help reduce this risk.\nRead more about drinking and alcohol\nSome anti-seizure medication (ASMs) can reduce the effectiveness of some types of contraception. This includes:\n- contraceptive injections\n- contraceptive patches\n- the combined oral contraceptive pill&nbsp;– often known as &#8216;the pill&#8217;\n- the&nbsp;progesterone-only pill (POP)&nbsp;or &#8216;mini pill&#8217;\n- contraceptive implants\nIf you&#8217;re sexually active and do not want to become pregnant, ask your GP or epilepsy specialist if your ASMs could affect your contraception.\nYou may need to ensure you or your partner use another form of contraception like a&nbsp;condom&nbsp;or&nbsp;intrauterine device (IUD).\nThe effectiveness of the ASM lamotrigine may be reduced if you&#8217;re taking the combined oral contraceptive pill.\nSome ASMs can make the emergency contraceptive pill less effective. If you need emergency contraception, you may need an IUD. Your GP, family planning clinic or pharmacist should be able to help you.\nThere&#8217;s no reason why women with epilepsy cannot have a healthy pregnancy.\nIt&#8217;s better if the pregnancy is planned because there&#8217;s a slightly higher risk of complications. With forward planning, you can minimise these risks.\nThe main risk is that some ASMs increase the chances of a serious birth defect, like spina bifida, cleft lip or&nbsp;congenital heart disease. The risks depend on the type of ASM and the dose you&#8217;re taking.\nThe&nbsp;UK Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register&nbsp;can provide more information and advice about the use of ASMs during pregnancy.\nIf you&#8217;re planning a pregnancy, talk to your epilepsy specialist. It may be possible to change the ASM you&#8217;re taking to minimise risks. Taking 400&nbsp;micrograms (mcg)&nbsp;of a folic acid supplement each day can also help reduce risks of birth defects. You might be recommended to take more than this by your healthcare team.\nIf you discover you&#8217;re pregnant, do not stop taking your medicine. The risks to your baby from uncontrolled seizures are far higher than any risks associated with your medicines.\nIf you&#8217;re breastfeeding or planned to breastfeed, discuss the medication you&#8217;re taking with your healthcare team or midwife.\nMany children with well-controlled epilepsy can learn and take part in their school’s activities unaffected by their condition. Others may need extra support to get the most out of their time at school.\nMake sure your child’s teachers know about their condition and the medication they need to control it.\nEpilepsy is more common among children with learning disabilities and special educational needs. These children are entitled to extra help to overcome their difficulties.\nYou must tell the Driving and Vehicle Licence Authority (DVLA) if you&#8217;ve had any epileptic seizures or blackouts. You must stop driving right away. If you ignore these regulations, you might be prosecuted.\nThe DVLA may wish to contact your GP or epilepsy specialist.\nThe DVLA may issue a licence if your seizures have never caused you to lose awareness or affected your ability to safely control a vehicle.\nYour GP has a legal responsibility to inform the DVLA if they feel that your driving is putting both you and others at risk.\nRead about epilepsy and driving on the DVLA website\nWhen somebody with epilepsy dies and there&#8217;s no clear cause, it&#8217;s known as sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).\nThe risk of SUDEP for someone with epilepsy is low.\nThe exact causes of SUDEP are unknown. It&#8217;s not possible to predict who it will affect. One theory is that seizures could affect the person&#8217;s breathing and heartbeat.\nThings that may lead to SUDEP include:\n- having seizures which cause loss of consciousness and the body to go stiff and jerk (tonic-clonic seizures)\n- poorly controlled epilepsy, such as not using ASMs prescribed to control seizures\n- having sudden and frequent changes to ASMs\n- being a young adult (in particular male)\n- having sleep seizures\n- having seizures when alone\n- drinking large amounts of alcohol\nIf you&#8217;re worried that your epilepsy is poorly controlled, contact your epilepsy specialist. It may be possible to refer you to a specialist epilepsy centre for further treatment.\nA charity called&nbsp;SUDEP Action&nbsp;can offer advice and support on SUDEP. They have a helpline for people who have lost a loved one as a result of epilepsy."

        "disease": "Erectile dysfunction (impotence)",
        "description": "Erectile dysfunction (ED), also known as impotence, is the inability to get and maintain an erection.\nErectile dysfunction&nbsp;is a very common condition, particularly in older men. It is estimated that half of all men between the ages of 40&nbsp;and 70 will have it to some degree.\nSee your GP if you have erectile dysfunction for more than a few weeks. They will assess your general state of health because the condition can be the first sign of more serious health conditions, such as heart disease (when the heart’s blood supply is blocked or interrupted).\nErectile dysfunction&nbsp;can have a range of causes, both physical and psychological. Physical causes include:\n- narrowing of the blood vessels going to the penis&nbsp;– commonly associated with&nbsp;high blood pressure (hypertension),&nbsp;high cholesterol or&nbsp;diabetes\n- hormonal problems\n- surgery or injury\nPsychological causes of ED include:\n- anxiety\n- depression&nbsp;\n- relationship problems\nSometimes erectile dysfunction only occurs in certain situations. For example, you may be able to get an erection during masturbation, or you may find that you sometimes wake up with an erection but you are unable to get an erection with your sexual partner.\nIf this is the case, it is likely the underlying cause of erectile dysfunction is psychological (stress related). If you are unable to get an erection under any circumstances, it is likely that the underlying cause is physical.\nErectile dysfunction can also be a side-effect of using certain medicines.\nRead more about the causes of erectile dysfunction\nAlthough you may be embarrassed, it&#8217;s important to get a diagnosis&nbsp;so that the cause can be identified.\nYour GP can usually diagnose erectile dysfunction. This will involve answering questions about your symptoms, as well as a physical examination and some simple tests.\nRead more about diagnosing erectile dysfunction\nErectile dysfunction is primarily treated by tackling the cause of the problem, whether this is physical or psychological.\nThe narrowing of the arteries (called atherosclerosis) is one of the most common causes of ED. In these cases&nbsp;your GP may suggest lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, to try to reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease. This may&nbsp;help to relieve your symptoms as well as improving your general health.\nYou may also be given medication to treat atherosclerosis, such as cholesterol-lowering&nbsp;statins and drugs to reduce your blood pressure.\nA number of treatments&nbsp;have&nbsp;been successful in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Medication, such&nbsp;as sildenafil (sold as Viagra),&nbsp;can be used to manage it in at least two-thirds of cases. Vacuum pumps that encourage blood to flow to the penis and cause an erection are also successful in 90% of cases.\nPsychological treatments&nbsp;include&nbsp;cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and sex therapy.\nOverall, treatments for&nbsp;erectile dysfunction&nbsp;have improved significantly in recent years. Most men are eventually able to have sex again.\nRead more about treating erectile dysfunction\nThe main symptom of erectile dysfunction (ED) is the inability to get and maintain an erection for satisfactory intercourse.\nED should not be confused with&nbsp;ejaculation problems such as premature ejaculation, which is a condition where the process of arousal, orgasm and ejaculation occurs very rapidly.\nSometimes ED only occurs in certain situations. For example, you may be able to get an erection during masturbation, or you may find that you sometimes wake up with an erection but you are unable to get an erection with your sexual partner.\nIn these circumstances, it is likely that the underlying cause of ED is primarily psychological (stress related). However, if you are unable to get an erection under any circumstances, it is likely that the underlying cause is primarily physical.\nSee your GP if ED persists for more than a few weeks. They will assess your general state of health because the condition can be the first sign of more serious health conditions, such as&nbsp;heart disease (when the heart’s blood supply is blocked or interrupted).\nMany websites offer treatments for ED but their use is not recommended. The medications that are offered by these sites could be fake and may be dangerous. Even if the medications are genuine, they may not be suitable for you.\nIt is important that you only take medication for ED that your GP has prescribed for you.\nRead more about&nbsp;treating erectile dysfunction\nErectile dysfunction (ED) can have many causes, such as certain medical conditions, medications and stress.\nIt&#8217;s important to identify&nbsp;the cause of erectile dysfunction and treat any underlying conditions.\nWhen&nbsp;a man&nbsp;becomes sexually excited (aroused), his brain sends signals to the nerves in his penis. The nerves increase the blood flow to the penis, causing the tissue to expand and harden.\nAnything that interferes with the nervous system or the blood circulation could lead to&nbsp;erectile dysfunction.\nAnything that affects the level of sexual desire (libido)&nbsp;can also cause&nbsp;erectile dysfunction because a reduced libido makes it more difficult for the brain to trigger an erection. Psychological conditions, such as depression, can reduce libido, as can changes in hormone levels (chemicals produced by the body).\nThere are four main types of health conditions that can cause physical problems resulting in&nbsp;erectile dysfunction. These are:\n- conditions affecting the flow of blood to your penis&nbsp;– vasculogenic\n- conditions affecting your nervous system, which is made up of your brain, nerves and spinal cord – neurogenic\n- conditions affecting your hormone levels – hormonal\n- conditions affecting the physical structure of your penis&nbsp;– anatomical\nPenis injuries or surgical treatment of the penis, pelvis or surrounding areas can sometimes lead to erectile dysfunction.\nErectile dysfunction is also thought to occur in up to 15-25% of people who&nbsp;experience a severe head injury.\nExamples of vasculogenic conditions that cause erectile dysfunction include:\n- cardiovascular disease&nbsp;– a disease of the heart or blood vessels, such as atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries)&nbsp;\n- high blood pressure&nbsp;(hypertension)\n- diabetes&nbsp;–&nbsp;a condition caused by high blood sugar levels. This can affect both the blood supply and the nerve endings in your penis, so it is also a neurogenic condition\nErectile dysfunction&nbsp;is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease. For this reason, it may be one of the first causes your GP considers when&nbsp;making a diagnosis&nbsp;and planning your treatment.\nExamples of neurogenic conditions that cause&nbsp;erectile dysfunction include:\n- multiple sclerosis&nbsp;– a condition that affects the body&#8217;s actions, such as movement and balance&nbsp;\n- Parkinson’s disease&nbsp;– a condition that affects the way that the brain coordinates body movements, including walking, talking and writing\n- a spinal injury or disorder\n- a&nbsp;stroke&nbsp;– a serious condition that occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted\nExamples of hormonal conditions that cause&nbsp;erectile dysfunction include:\n- hypogonadism&nbsp;– a condition that affects the production of the male sex hormone, testosterone, causing abnormally low levels&nbsp;\n- an&nbsp;overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism)&nbsp;– where too much thyroid hormone is produced\n- an&nbsp;underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) – where not enough thyroid hormone is produced&nbsp;\n- Cushing&#8217;s syndrome&nbsp;– a condition that affects the production of a hormone called cortisol\nPeyronie&#8217;s disease, which affects the tissue of the penis, is an example of an anatomical condition that can cause&nbsp;erectile dysfunction.\nIn some men,&nbsp;certain medicines can cause&nbsp;erectile dysfunction, including:\n- diuretics – these increase the production of urine and are often used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension), heart failure and kidney disease&nbsp;\n- antihypertensives&nbsp;– such as beta-blockers, that are used to treat high blood pressure\n- fibrates&nbsp;– medicines used to lower&nbsp;cholesterol levels\n- antipsychotics&nbsp;– used to treat some mental health conditions, such as&nbsp;schizophrenia&nbsp;\n- antidepressants&nbsp;–&nbsp; used to treat depression and some types of pain\n- corticosteroids&nbsp;– medication that contains steroids, which are a type of hormone\n- H2-antagonists&nbsp;– medicines used to treat stomach ulcers\n- anticonvulsants&nbsp;– used to treat&nbsp;epilepsy\n- antihistamines –&nbsp;used to treat allergic health conditions, such as&nbsp;hay fever\n- anti-androgens&nbsp;– medication that suppresses androgens (male sex hormones)&nbsp;\n- cytotoxics&nbsp;– medication used in chemotherapy to prevent cancer cells from dividing and growing\nSpeak to your GP if you are concerned that a prescribed medicine is causing erectile dysfunction. Alternative medication may be available. However,&nbsp;it is important never to&nbsp;stop taking a prescribed medicine unless you are advised to do so by a qualified healthcare professional who is responsible for your care.\nPossible psychological causes of&nbsp;erectile dysfunction include:\n- depression&nbsp;– feelings of extreme sadness that last for a long time\n- anxiety&nbsp;– a feeling of unease, such as worry or fear\nErectile dysfunction can often have both physical and psychological causes. For example, if you have diabetes, it may be difficult for you to get an erection, which may cause you to become anxious about the situation. The combination of diabetes and anxiety may lead to an episode of erectile dysfunction.\nThere are&nbsp;many emotional issues that may also affect your physical ability to get or maintain an erection. These include:\n- relationship problems\n- lack of sexual knowledge\n- past sexual problems\n- past sexual abuse\n- being in a new relationship&nbsp;\nOther possible causes of&nbsp;erectile dysfunction&nbsp;include:\n- excessive alcohol intake&nbsp;\n- tiredness\n- using illegal drugs, such as cannabis, heroin or cocaine\nMen who cycle for more than three hours per week may be recommended to try a period without cycling to see if this helps improve erectile dysfunction.\nRiding in the correct position with a properly fitted seat may also help to prevent regular cycling from leading to erectile dysfunction.\nErectile dysfunction (ED) can often be diagnosed by your GP. They will talk to you about your situation and may carry out a physical examination.\nYour GP may ask you about:\n- your symptoms\n- your overall physical and mental health\n- your alcohol consumption\n- whether you take drugs\n- whether you are currently taking any medication\nIf you do not want to talk to your GP about erectile dysfunction, you can visit a genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic. You can find your nearest GUM clinic on the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV&nbsp;(BASHH) website.\nYou&#8217;ll also be asked&nbsp;about your sexual history. Try not to be embarrassed because&nbsp;erectile dysfunction is a common problem.&nbsp;You can request a male GP at your surgery if you prefer.\nYou may be asked about:\n- your previous and current sexual relationships&nbsp;\n- what your sexual orientation is&nbsp;\n- how long you have been experiencing erectile dysfunction\n- whether you can get any degree of erection with your partner, on your own or when you wake up in the morning&nbsp;\n- whether you have been able to ejaculate or orgasm\n- your libido (your level of sexual desire)\nErectile dysfunction&nbsp;that&nbsp;happens all the time may suggest an underlying physical cause.\nErectile dysfunction that&nbsp;only occurs when you are attempting to have sex may suggest an underlying psychological (mental) cause.\nYour GP may assess your cardiovascular health. Narrowed blood vessels are a common cause of erectile dysfunction and linked with cardiovascular disease (conditions that affect the heart and blood flow).\nYour GP may:\n- measure your blood pressure to see if you have&nbsp;high blood pressure (hypertension)\n- listen to your heart rate to check for any abnormalities\n- measure your height, weight and waist circumference to see if you are a healthy weight for your height&nbsp;\n- ask you about your diet and lifestyle, for example, how much exercise you do\n- test a sample of your blood for glucose (sugar) and lipids (fatty substances), as high levels can indicate conditions affecting your heart or blood vessels\nA&nbsp;physical examination of your penis may be carried out&nbsp;to rule out anatomical causes (conditions that affect the physical structure of your penis).\nIf you have symptoms of an enlarged prostate, such as weak or irregular urination, a&nbsp;digital rectal examination (DRE) may be suggested.&nbsp;\nBlood tests&nbsp;can also&nbsp;check for underlying health conditions. For example, measuring the levels of hormones such as testosterone can rule out hormonal conditions, such as hypogonadism (an abnormally low level of testosterone).\nIn some cases you may be referred to a specialist for further testing. This might be the case if you&nbsp;are unusually young to be experiencing&nbsp;erectile dysfunction as it&#8217;s rare in men under 40 years of age.&nbsp;\nAn intracavernous injection test involves injecting a man-made (synthetic) hormone into your penis to increase the blood flow. This helps&nbsp;assess any&nbsp;abnormalities in your penis and plan surgery.&nbsp;\nIf the injection doesn&#8217;t result in an&nbsp;erection it may indicate a problem with the blood supply to your penis. In some cases, you may also need an ultrasound scan.\nThese specialised tests involve injecting dye into the blood vessels of your penis and studying the dye on a scanner. These are likely to be used if you are being considered for surgery or if a problem has been detected with your blood vessels.\nIf the cause of your erectile dysfunction is thought to be psychological, you may be reffered&nbsp;for a psychological assessment.\nIf you have erectile dysfunction (ED), treatment will depend on what&#8217;s causing it. The various treatments for erectile dysfunction are outlined below.&nbsp;\nIf your&nbsp;erectile dysfunction is caused by an underlying health condition, such as heart disease or diabetes, that condition may need to be treated first. In some cases, treating the underlying cause may also resolve the problem.\nIf you are taking medication that can cause erectile dysfunction, there may be an alternative. It is important never to stop taking a prescribed medication unless you are advised to do so by your GP or another qualified healthcare professional responsible for your care.\nErectile dysfunction can often be improved by making changes to your lifestyle, such as:\n- losing weight if you are overweight&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n- giving up smoking\n- cutting back&nbsp;your alcohol&nbsp;consumption&nbsp;\n- not taking illegal drugs&nbsp;\n- exercising regularly&nbsp;\n- reducing&nbsp;stress&nbsp;\nAs well as helping to improve your&nbsp;erectile dysfunction, these changes can also improve your general health and may help to reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease (conditions that affect your heart and blood vessels).\nRead more about&nbsp;preventing cardiovascular disease&nbsp;&nbsp;\nPhosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors are one of the most widely used and effective types of medication for treating erectile dysfunction. They work by temporarily increasing the blood flow to your penis.\nIn England,&nbsp;four PDE-5 inhibitors are available for treating erectile dysfunction. They are:\n- sildenafil&nbsp;– sold under the brand name Viagra&nbsp;\n- tadalafil&nbsp;– sold under the brand name Cialis\n- vardenafil&nbsp;– sold under the brand name Levitra\n- avanafil&nbsp;– sold under the brand name Spedra\nSildenafil, vardenafil and avanafil work for about eight hours and they are designed to work &#8216;on demand&#8217;. Tadalafil lasts for up to 36 hours and is more suitable if you require treatment for a longer period of time, for example, over a weekend.\nDepending on the type of PDE-5 inhibitor you are taking and the dose, it should take about 30-60 minutes before it starts to work. With sildenafil, vardenafil and avanafil, you should be able to have sex from one to 10 hours after taking the medicine. After taking tadalafil, the effects will last for up to 36 hours.\nIt may take longer to notice the effects if the tablet is taken with food, so it&#8217;s best to take it on an empty stomach. You can then eat after an hour without affecting the medicine.\nOnly take one tablet within a 24-hour period.\nYour GP should explain the benefits of each medication and how it works. The choice may depend on:\n- how often you are sexually active&nbsp;\n- whether you have tried any of the medications before\nThere have been many studies to test the effectiveness of these medications. In general,&nbsp;at least&nbsp;two-thirds of men report having improved erections after taking one of these medicines.\nIf you do not find that PDE-5 inhibitors are effective it may be because:\n- you have not waited long enough after taking the dose\n- you have waited too long after taking the dose\n- the dose is not high enough\n- you have not had enough sexual stimulation\nThese medications are triggered by sexual stimulation, so you also need to be aroused for it to work.\nPDE-5 inhibitors should be used&nbsp;with caution in men who have cardiovascular disease, such as coronary heart disease. However, sexual activity is also likely to be beneficial for your cardiovascular health. You should discuss the risks and benefits with your GP.\nPDE-5 inhibitors should also be used with caution in men who have anatomical problems with their penis, such as Peyronie&#8217;s disease (a condition that affects the tissue of the penis).\nPDE-5 inhibitors should also be used with caution in men who:\n- are at risk of priapism&nbsp;– a painful erection that lasts for several hours\n- are also taking long lasting alpha-blockers – a medication used to treat a number of conditions, such as high blood pressure (hypertension)\nDo not take PDE-5 inhibitors if you are also taking medicines or recreational drugs that contain nitrates. The combination of the two substances can have a dangerous effect on your heart.\nOrganic nitrates are often used to treat angina, and butyl nitrate is a recreational drug that is more commonly known as &#8216;poppers&#8217;.\nYou&nbsp;are&nbsp;also&nbsp;warned&nbsp;not to take PDE-5 inhibitors if you:\n- have been advised not to take part in sexual activity or in activities that widen your blood vessels&nbsp;\n- have&nbsp;low blood pressure (hypotension)&nbsp;\n- have recently had a&nbsp;stroke&nbsp;– a medical emergency that occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted\n- have unstable&nbsp;angina&nbsp;– an underlying heart condition that causes symptoms such as chest pain\n- have had a&nbsp;heart attack&nbsp;– a medical emergency where the blood supply to the heart is suddenly blocked\n- have a history of non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy&nbsp;– an eye condition that causes a sudden loss of vision\nPDE-5 inhibitors can cause some side effects, including:\n- headaches and migraines\n- flushing (redness)&nbsp;\n- indigestion\n- nausea (feeling sick)\n- vomiting (being sick)\n- a blocked or runny nose\n- back pain\n- vision disturbances\n- muscle pain\nA vacuum pump consists of a clear plastic tube that is connected to a pump, which is either hand or battery operated.\nYou place your penis in the tube and pump out all of the air. This creates a vacuum that causes the blood to fill your penis, making it erect. You then place a rubber ring around the base of your penis to keep the blood in place, allowing you to maintain an erection for around 30 minutes.\nIt may take several attempts to learn how to use the pump correctly, but they are usually effective. After using a vacuum pump,&nbsp;nine out of 10 men are able to have sex, regardless of the cause of their ED.\nYou should not use a vacuum pump if you have a bleeding disorder or if you are taking anticoagulant medicines, which reduce the ability of your blood to clot.\nSide effects of vacuum pumps include pain or bruising, although these occur in less than a third of men.\nMen who qualify for NHS prescriptions for erectile dysfunction treatments may be able to get a vacuum pump on the NHS (see above for more details). However,&nbsp;some men will need to buy one.\nIf your&nbsp;erectile dysfunction doesn&#8217;t&nbsp;respond to treatment, or you are unable or unwilling to use PDE-5 inhibitors or a vacuum pump, you may be given a medicine called alprostadil. This is a synthetic (man-made) hormone that helps to stimulate blood flow to the penis.\nAlprostadil is available as:\n- an injection directly into your penis&nbsp;– this is called an intracavernosal injection\n- a small pellet placed inside your urethra (the tube that carries urine from your bladder to the tip of your penis)&nbsp;– this is called urethral application\nYou may be trained to correctly inject or insert alprostadil. If your partner is pregnant,&nbsp;use a condom during sex if you are inserting alprostadil into your urethra.\nAlprostadil will usually produce an erection after five to 15 minutes. How long the erection lasts will depend on the dose.\nIn men who did not respond to PDE-5 inhibitors, alprostadil injections were successful in 85 out of 100 men. Alprostadil inserted into the urethra is successful for up to two-thirds of men.\nAlprostadil should not be used:\n- in&nbsp;men at risk of priapism (a painful erection that lasts for several hours)&nbsp;– for example, those with sickle cell anaemia\n- alongside other&nbsp;erectile dysfunction medications&nbsp;\n- if you have a penile implant or if you have been advised to avoid sexual activity&nbsp;\nUrethral application may also not be used in:\n- some&nbsp;men who have anatomical problems with their penis (conditions that affect the physical structure of the penis)&nbsp;\n- men who have infections of their penis, such as&nbsp;balantis&nbsp;(inflammation of the head of the penis)\nAlprostadil can cause some side effects including:\n- changes in your blood pressure\n- dizziness\n- headache\n- pain in your penis&nbsp;\n- urethral burning or bleeding\n- reactions at the site of the injection, such as swelling\nAs with PDE-5 inhibitors, NHS prescriptions for alprostadil may only be available for&nbsp;men with particular health conditions or those receiving some types of medical treatments. If you need to pay the full prescription cost, a single injection of alprostadil costs around £8 to £22, depending on the dose. A single dose of alprostadil for urethral application is around £10.&nbsp;\nIf a hormonal condition is causing&nbsp;erectile dysfunction, you may be referred to an endocrinologist (who specialises in the treatment of hormonal conditions).\nHormones are chemicals produced by the body. Many hormonal conditions can be treated using injections of synthetic (man-made) hormones to restore normal hormone levels.\nSurgery for&nbsp;erectile dysfunction is usually only recommended if all other treatment methods have failed. It may also be considered in:\n- younger men who have experienced serious injury to their pelvic area&nbsp;– for example, in a car accident\n- men with a significant anatomical problem with their penis\nIn the past, surgery was used if there was clear evidence of a blockage to the blood supply of the penis. The surgeon could unblock the blood vessels to restore a normal supply of blood. However, research now suggests that the long-term results of this type of surgery are poor, so it&#8217;s unlikely to be used.\nPenile implants are a type of surgery that may be considered. These can be:\n- semi-rigid implants – which may be suitable for older men who do not have sex regularly\n- inflatable implants – which consist of two or three parts that can be inflated to give a more natural erection\nPenile implants are not usually available on the NHS and inflatable implants may be very expensive. However, around three-quarters of men report being satisfied with the results of this type of surgery.\nAs with all types of surgery, having penile implants inserted&nbsp;carries a risk of infection. If you take preventative antibiotics, the rate of infection is around&nbsp;two&nbsp;or three&nbsp;in 100. Mechanical problems with the implants may occur within five years in&nbsp;five&nbsp;per cent of&nbsp;cases.&nbsp;\nIf your&nbsp;erectile dysfunction has an underlying psychological cause then you may benefit from a type of treatment called sensate focus.\nIf conditions such as anxiety or depression are causing your&nbsp;erectile dysfunction, you may benefit from&nbsp;counselling&nbsp;(a talking therapy).\nSensate focus is a type of sex therapy that you and your partner complete together. It starts with you&nbsp;both agreeing not to have sex for a number of weeks or months. During this time, you can still touch each other, but not in the genital area (or a woman’s breasts). The idea is to explore your bodies knowing that you will not have sex.\nAfter the agreed period of time has passed, you can gradually begin touching each other’s genital areas. You can also begin to use your mouth to touch your partner, for example, licking or kissing, them. This can build up to include penetrative sex.\nYou can find out more about sensate focus from the College&nbsp;of&nbsp;Sexual and Relationship Therapists (COSRT).\nPsychosexual counselling is a form of relationship therapy where you and your partner can discuss any sexual or emotional issues that may be contributing to your&nbsp;erectile dysfunction. By talking about the issues, you may be able to reduce any anxiety that you have and overcome your&nbsp;erectile dysfunction.\nThe counsellor can also provide you with some practical advice about sex, such as how to make effective use of other treatments for&nbsp;erectile dysfunction to improve your sex life.\nPsychosexual counselling may take time to work and the results achieved have been mixed.\nCognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is another form of counselling that may be useful if you have&nbsp;erectile dysfunction. CBT is based on the principle that the way you feel is partly dependent on the way you think about things. CBT helps you realise that your problems are often created by your mindset. It is not the situation itself that is making you unhappy, but how you think about it and react to it.\nYour CBT therapist can help you to identify any unhelpful or unrealistic thoughts that may be contributing to your erectile dysfunction – for example, to do with:\n- your self-esteem (the way you feel about yourself)&nbsp;\n- your sexuality&nbsp;\n- your personal relationships\nYour CBT therapist will be able to help you to adopt more realistic and helpful thoughts about these issues.\nSome studies have suggested that, in a few cases, it may be beneficial to exercise your pelvic floor muscles. These are a group of muscles around the underside of the bladder and rectum, as well as at the base of the penis.\nPelvic floor muscle exercise involves strengthening and training the muscles used to control the anus (back passage) and urinate. If your GP feels this type of exercise could be beneficial, then you may want to discuss it with a physiotherapist to learn it correctly.\nBy strengthening and training&nbsp;these muscles, you may be able to reduce the symptoms of&nbsp;erectile dysfunction.\nSome complementary therapies, such as acupuncture, have claimed to treat erectile dysfunction. However, there is little evidence they are useful.\nIn some cases, they may even include ingredients that could interact with other medications and cause side effects.\nAlways speak to your GP before using any complementary therapies."

        "disease": "Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157",
        "description": "Escherichia coli O157, sometimes called STEC (Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli), is a bacterial infection. It can cause severe stomach pain, bloody diarrhoea and kidney failure.\nE. coli O157 is found in the gut and faeces of many animals, particularly cattle. It’s an uncommon cause of gastroenteritis but can be caught by:\n- eating contaminated food, such as raw leafy vegetables or undercooked meat – always wash all vegetables, including salad leaves, that will be eaten raw, unless they have been pre-prepared and are labelled ‘ready to eat’ (washing may reduce the risk of infection, but will not eliminate any risk of infection completely)\n- touching infected animals or accidentally coming into contact with their faeces\n- contact with people who have the illness, particularly if you do not wash your hands thoroughly after using the toilet or before handling food\n- drinking water from inadequately treated water supplies\n- swimming or playing in contaminated water, such as ponds or streams\nYou or your child has diarrhoea and:\nYou should contact your GP if you have a child under 12 months and are concerned.\nSymptoms include diarrhoea, stomach cramps and occasionally fever. About half of people with the infection will have bloody diarrhoea.\nPeople usually notice symptoms 3 to 4 days after they have been infected. But symptoms can start any time between 1 and 14 days afterwards.\nThese symptoms can last up to 2 weeks.\nA small number of people with E. coli O157 infection go on to develop a serious condition called haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS). Symptoms of HUS include:\n- peeing less\n- tiredness\n- swelling\n- bruising\nThis can sometimes lead to kidney failure and death, although this is rare. The risk of HUS is highest in children aged under 5 years.\nSome people become infected but don’t develop symptoms.\nFurther information about gastroenteritis\nThere is no specific treatment for E. coli O157 infection. People who are infected can usually be cared for at home and most will get better without medical treatment.\nIt’s important to drink plenty of fluids, as diarrhoea can lead to dehydration.\nAntibiotics are not recommended, and may increase the risk of complications.\nAnti-diarrhoea drugs such as loperamide (Imodium) are also not recommended as they may prolong your exposure to the toxin.\nFind out more about caring for a child with gastroenteritis and caring for an adult with gastroenteritis.\nStrict hygiene measures are essential to stop others getting infected.\nAnyone who has had an E. coli O157 infection should stay away from work or school until they have been completely free of symptoms for 48 hours.\nMost people are no longer infectious after about a week, although some people, particularly children, may carry E. coli O157 for several months after they have got better.\nSome people need to take special care before returning to work or school.\nIf you work in health or social care, or your work involves handling food, you should ask your local authority environmental health officers about when it is safe to return to work. This advice applies to both people who have been infected and those who live in the same household as someone who has.\nIf you have a child under 5 years of age who has had E. coli, or lives with someone who has, you should talk to your GP about when it is safe for your child to return to school or nursery.\nChildren under 5 years of age who have had an E. coli O157 infection should not swim in public swimming pools, or share paddling pools with others, until they have had test results showing that they are no longer an infection risk to others."

        "disease": "Ewing sarcoma",
        "description": "Ewing sarcoma is a rare type of bone cancer.\nThe 3 main types of primary bone cancer are chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma.\nEwing sarcoma most commonly affects people who are 10 to 20 years old.\nA sarcoma is a type of&nbsp;cancer&nbsp;that develops in the body’s supporting tissues. Bone sarcomas and&nbsp;soft tissue sarcomas&nbsp;are the 2 main types.\nEwing sarcoma usually occurs in bone. It most commonly develops in the:\n- pelvis bone&nbsp;(hips)\n- thigh bone&nbsp;(femur)\n- shin bone (tibia)\nHowever,&nbsp;the condition&nbsp;can also develop in the soft tissues surrounding the bone or joint. This type of Ewing sarcoma is known as extraosseous, which means outside the bone.\nThe symptoms of Ewing sarcoma will depend on the size of the cancer and where it is in the body.\nThe main symptoms are pain in the affected area that gets progressively worse, and swelling and tenderness.\nOther possible, but less common, symptoms may include a high temperature (fever), severe tiredness and weight loss.\nIn some cases of Ewing sarcoma, there may not be any symptoms at all. However, as the tumour grows it could weaken the affected bone, increasing the risk of fracture.\nLike&nbsp;other types of bone cancer, the exact cause of Ewing sarcoma is&nbsp;unknown.\nAs the&nbsp;condition tends to predominantly affect older children and teenagers, one theory is&nbsp;that it may be related to fast-growing bones.\nThe rapid growth spurt that&nbsp;happens during puberty&nbsp;may in some way make bone tissue more vulnerable to cancer.\nResearch has also found babies born with an&nbsp;umbilical hernia are 3 times more likely to develop Ewing sarcoma.&nbsp;\nHowever, the increased risk is still small as only 1 in 110,000 children with an umbilical hernia will go on to develop the condition.\nThe Cancer Research UK website has more information about the risks and causes of bone cancer.\nWhen&nbsp;you visit your GP because of bone pain, they’ll ask you about your symptoms and examine the affected area.\nYour GP may refer you for&nbsp;an&nbsp;X-ray&nbsp;to check for anything abnormal. If&nbsp;abnormalities are found, you’ll be referred to an orthopaedic surgeon (a bone specialist).\nThey may recommend that you&nbsp;have a&nbsp;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan&nbsp;to examine the area in closer detail.\nA bone&nbsp;biopsy&nbsp;may be carried out to confirm whether cancer is present. A fine needle&nbsp;is used to remove a sample of bone marrow from the affected area so it can be examined under a microscope. It can either be carried out using a&nbsp;general anaesthetic&nbsp;or a&nbsp;local anaesthetic.\nThe Cancer Research UK website has more information about tests for bone cancer and the stages of bone cancer.\nLike all types of cancer, the earlier Ewing sarcoma is diagnosed, the easier it is to treat.\nEwing sarcoma is usually treated with a combination of&nbsp;chemotherapy,&nbsp;surgery and radiotherapy.\nChemotherapy may be used before surgery to shrink the tumour and make it easier to remove.\nEwing sarcoma also responds well to&nbsp;radiotherapy. It can be used to shrink the tumour after chemotherapy, and before or after surgery to lower the risk of the cancer returning.\nIn some cases, surgically removing Ewing’s sarcoma can be difficult&nbsp;– for example, if it develops in the pelvis. In this case, radiotherapy may be used as the main treatment.\nIf surgery is recommended, the type you’ll have will depend on:\n- the size of the tumour\n- where it is in your body\n- whether it has&nbsp;grown into the tissues surrounding the bone\nYou may have surgery to remove part or all of the bone affected by cancer. This type of surgery is known as resection.\nLimb-sparing surgery&nbsp;involves removing the area of bone on an arm or leg&nbsp;where the cancer is growing. A piece of metal (prosthesis) or a bone graft will be used to replace the piece of bone that is removed.\nIn some cases, your whole arm or leg may need to be removed (amputation).&nbsp;This may be the only option&nbsp;to prevent the cancer returning if it’s spread into the tissues surrounding the bone.\nFor more information about the types of treatment for bone cancer, visit the Cancer Research UK website.\nIf you’re diagnosed with bone cancer, it can be upsetting and&nbsp;frightening.&nbsp;Knowing as much about the type of cancer you have and the best treatment options will help you&nbsp;make decisions.\nThe majority of people who have surgery for bone cancer have a limb-sparing procedure.\nHowever, for some people, having their limb amputated may be the best option. This can be a very difficult situation to cope with and you may experience emotions such as grief and&nbsp;bereavement.\nIt’s important to seek help and talk about how you’re feeling. You could talk to&nbsp;your partner, family, friends or the healthcare professionals in charge of your care. Talking to others will help you come to terms with your condition and treatment.\nThere are&nbsp;also a number of practical issues you’ll need to deal with, such as financial matters&nbsp;and coping with day-to-day activities&nbsp;such as school, college or work.\nThe Cancer Research UK website has more information on coping with bone cancer.\nIf you or your child has&nbsp;Ewing sarcoma, your clinical team will pass information about you/your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).\nThis helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition.

        "disease": "Ewing sarcoma: Children",
        "description": "Ewing sarcoma is a type of bone cancer in children and young people. This information describes Ewing sarcoma, its symptoms, diagnosis and possible treatments.\nMore children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are now new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.\nIt’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer. At times it can feel overwhelming but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.\nUnderstanding more about the cancer your child has, and the treatments that may be used, can often help parents to cope. Your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information and if you have any questions it’s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.\nSarcomas are rare types of cancer that develop in the supporting tissues of the body. There are 2 main types: bone sarcomas and soft tissue sarcomas.\nBone sarcomas can develop in any of the bones of the skeleton, but may also develop in the soft tissue near bones.\nSoft tissue sarcomas can develop in muscle, fat, blood vessels or any of the other tissues that support, surround and protect the organs of the body.\nEwing sarcoma is the second most common primary sarcoma in children and young people. This type of cancer is a bone cancer and most commonly occurs in the long bones, ribs, pelvis and spine (vertebral column).\nIt usually occurs in the teenage years, and is more common in boys.\nAlthough Ewing sarcoma is a type of bone cancer, it can also occur very rarely in the soft tissues. This is called extraosseous Ewing sarcoma. Another type of Ewing sarcoma is a primitive neuroectodermal tumour (PNET). These can be found in either the bone or soft tissue.\nThe exact causes of primary bone cancer are unknown. The development of Ewing sarcoma may be related in some way to times of rapid bone growth, which may explain why more cases are seen in teenagers. Like other cancers, it’s not infectious and cannot be passed on to other people.\nPain is the most common symptom of bone cancer. It is frequently worse at night. However, symptoms may vary depending on the position and size of the cancer. There may be some swelling in the affected area if the tumour is close to the surface of the body and it may become tender to touch. This may cause a limp if in the leg or pelvis. Bone cancer is sometimes discovered when a bone that has been weakened by cancer breaks after the child has a minor fall or accident. Occasionally, there may be fever or weight loss.\nUsually you begin by seeing your GP, who will examine your child and may arrange tests or X-rays. If a sarcoma is suspected, your GP should refer your child directly to a specialist hospital or bone tumour centre. A variety of tests and investigations are needed to diagnose Ewing sarcoma, including an X-ray of the painful part of the bone, a chest X-ray and a blood test. A specialist doctor will remove a small piece of the tumour to look at under a microscope (biopsy). Other tests may be done, such as a bone scan, PET scan, a bone marrow biopsy. An MRI or CT scan may also be done.\nAny tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you.\nA combination of various treatments is used to treat Ewing sarcoma. These include chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy. Treatment will depend on a number of factors, including the size and position of the tumour.\nChemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells.\nThis is a very important component of treatment for the majority of children with Ewing sarcoma and can help make surgery more straightforward. A combination of different chemotherapy drugs are given before surgery and continued afterwards in order to destroy any remaining cancer cells and prevent the sarcoma from spreading. Chemotherapy given in this way is called adjuvant chemotherapy.\nIf surgery is needed, it should be carried out at a specialist orthopaedic bone tumour centre. The aim of surgery is to remove the tumour without causing too much damage. If the tumour is in one of the main bones of the arm or leg, it may be necessary to remove the whole limb (amputation) or part of the affected bone. If only part of the affected bone is removed, this is known as limb-sparing surgery.\nSometimes amputation of the limb is unavoidable if the cancer has affected the surrounding blood vessels and nerves. After amputation, a false limb will be fitted, and this will be regularly adjusted as your child grows. False limbs work very well. It should be possible for your child to join in with normal activities and even sport.\nThere are several ways in which limb-sparing surgery may be done. It may involve:\n- replacing the bone with a prosthesis (a specially designed artificial part)\n- replacing the bone with bone taken from another part of the body (a bone graft)\nAfter limb-sparing surgery, the child is often able to use the limb almost normally. However, it is best not to take part in any contact sports, because any damage to the bone graft or prosthesis may require another major operation to repair or replace it. If the child is growing, the limb prosthesis will need to be lengthened from time to time as the bone grows. This may mean further short stays in hospital, although some prostheses can be lengthened during an outpatient procedure.\nRadiotherapy treats cancer by using high energy rays that destroy cancer cells while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. Ewing sarcoma responds very well to radiotherapy. It’s often used after chemotherapy and before or after surgery. If the tumour is impossible to remove surgically, it’s a good option.\nTreatment often causes&nbsp;side effects. Your child’s doctor will discuss this with you before the treatment starts. Any possible side effects will depend on the actual treatment being used and the part of the body that’s being treated.\nSide effects can include:\n- feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting)\n- hair loss\n- increased risk of infection\n- bruising and bleeding\n- tiredness\n- diarrhoea\nRadiotherapy&nbsp;can cause irritation or soreness of the skin in the area being treated and general tiredness. If your child is having surgery, the surgeon will explain the possible complications of the surgery that your child is having.\nA small number of children may develop other side effects, sometimes many years later. These include a reduction in normal bone growth, reduced fertility, a change in heart function, and a small increase in the risk of developing a second cancer later in life. Your child’s doctor or nurse will explain all of this to you and will monitor your child carefully for any potential late side effects.\nMany children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. Specialist doctors carry out trials for children’s cancers. If appropriate, your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial, and will answer any questions you have. Written information will be provided to help explain things.\nSometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child’s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The&nbsp;Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group&nbsp;(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.\nYour child will have regular follow-up appointments, with x-rays or scans as necessary. Many children with Ewing sarcoma can be cured. Even if the tumour comes back, further treatment may be given successfully. Your child will be checked up on every few months for the first 3 years after treatment and then every 6 months for another 2 years.\nIf you have specific concerns about your child’s condition and treatment, it’s best to discuss them with your child’s doctor who knows the situation in detail.\nAs a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time.\nYour child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer.\nFurther information and advice if your child has cancer"

        "description": "There are a number of different types of cancer that affect the eyes, including:\n- eye melanoma\n- squamous cell carcinoma\n- lymphoma\n- retinoblastoma&nbsp;– a childhood cancer\nCancer can also sometimes develop in the tissues surrounding your eyeball or spread to the eye from other&nbsp;parts of the body, such as the lungs or breasts.\nThis topic focuses on melanoma of the eye, one of the most common types of eye cancer.&nbsp;\nEye cancer doesn’t always cause obvious symptoms and may only be picked up during a routine eye test.\nSymptoms of eye cancer can include:\n- shadows, flashes of light, or wiggly lines in your vision\n- blurred vision\n- a dark patch in your&nbsp;eye that’s getting bigger\n- partial or total loss of vision\n- bulging of one eye\n- a lump on your eyelid or in&nbsp;your eye that’s increasing in size\n- pain in or around your eye, although this is rare\nThese symptoms can also be caused by more minor eye conditions, so they’re not necessarily a sign of cancer. However, it’s important to get the symptoms&nbsp;checked by a doctor as soon as possible.\nMelanoma is cancer that develops from pigment-producing cells called melanocytes. Most&nbsp;melanomas develop in the skin, but it’s also possible for them to occur in other parts of the body, including the eye.\nEye melanoma most commonly affects the eyeball. Doctors sometimes call it&nbsp;uveal or choroidal melanoma, depending on exactly which part of your eye is affected.\nIt&nbsp;can also affect the conjunctiva, the thin&nbsp;layer that covers the front of the eye, or the eyelid.\nEye melanoma occurs when&nbsp;the pigment-producing cells in the eyes divide and multiply too rapidly. This produces a lump of tissue known as a tumour.\nIt’s not clear exactly why this occurs, but the following factors may increase the risk of it happening:\n- lighter eye colour – if you have blue, grey or green eyes, you have a higher risk of developing eye melanoma compared&nbsp;with people who have brown eyes\n- white or pale skin – eye melanoma mostly affects white people and is more common in&nbsp;those with fair skin\n- unusual moles – if you have&nbsp;irregularly shaped or unusually coloured moles, you’re more at risk of developing&nbsp;skin cancer&nbsp;and eye melanoma\n- use of sunbeds –&nbsp;there’s some evidence to suggest that exposing yourself to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunbeds, for example, can increase your risk of eye melanoma\n- overexposure to sunlight – this increases your risk of skin cancer, and may also be a risk factor for eye melanoma\nThe risk of developing eye melanoma also increases with age, with most cases being diagnosed in people in their fifties.\nIf your GP or optician (optometrist) suspects&nbsp;you have a serious problem with your eyes, they will refer you to a specialist eye doctor called an ophthalmologist&nbsp;for an assessment.\nIf they suspect you have melanoma of the eye, they’ll refer you to a specialist centre for eye cancer. There are 4 centres in the UK, located in London, Sheffield, Liverpool, and Glasgow.\nIt’s likely you’ll have a number of different tests at the centre, including:\n- an eye examination –&nbsp;to look at the structures of your eyes in more detail and check for abnormalities\n- an&nbsp;ultrasound scan&nbsp;of your eye –&nbsp;a small probe placed over your closed eye uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your eye; this allows&nbsp;your doctor to&nbsp;find&nbsp;out more about the position of the tumour and its size\n- a&nbsp;fluorescein angiogram – where photographs of the suspected cancer are taken using a special camera after dye has been injected into your bloodstream to highlight the tumour\nOccasionally,&nbsp;a thin needle&nbsp;may be&nbsp;used to remove a small sample&nbsp;of cells from&nbsp;the&nbsp;tumour&nbsp;(biopsy).&nbsp;The genetic information in these cells is analysed to&nbsp;give an indication of the chances of the cancer spreading or coming back.\nTreatment for melanoma of the eye depends on the size and location of the tumour. Your care team will explain each treatment option in detail, including the benefits and any potential complications.\nTreatment will aim to conserve the affected eye whenever possible.\nThe main treatments for eye melanoma are:\n- brachytherapy –&nbsp;tiny plates lined with radioactive material called plaques are inserted near&nbsp;the tumour and left in place for up to a week to kill the cancerous cells\n- external&nbsp;radiotherapy&nbsp;– a machine is used to carefully aim beams of radiation at the tumour to kill the cancerous cells\n- surgery to remove the tumour or part of the eye – this may be possible if&nbsp;the tumour is small and you still have some vision in your eye\n- removal of the eye (enucleation) – this may be necessary if the tumour is large or you’ve lost your vision;&nbsp;the eye will eventually be replaced with an artificial eye that matches&nbsp;your other eye\nChemotherapy&nbsp;is rarely used for eye melanoma, but may be suitable for other types of eye cancer.\nCancer Research UK has more information about the treatment options for eye cancer and the types of eye cancer surgery."

        "disease": "Febrile seizures",
        "description": "A febrile seizure is a fit that can happen when a child has a fever.\nFebrile seizures are also sometimes called febrile convulsions. They are relatively common and, in most cases, aren&#8217;t serious.\nAround one in 20 children will have at least one febrile seizure at some point. They most often occur&nbsp;between the ages of six months and three years.\nDuring a febrile seizure, the child&#8217;s body usually becomes stiff, they lose consciousness and their arms and legs twitch. Some children may wet themselves. This is known as a tonic clonic seizure.\nRead more about the symptoms of febrile seizures\nIf your child is having a febrile seizure, place them in the recovery position. Lay them on their side, on a soft surface, with their face turned to one side. This will stop them swallowing any vomit, keep their airway open and help prevent injury.\nStay with&nbsp;your child&nbsp;and try to make a note of how long the seizure lasts.\nIf it&#8217;s your child&#8217;s first seizure, or it lasts longer than five minutes,&nbsp;take them to the&nbsp;nearest hospital&nbsp;as soon as possible, or dial 999 for an ambulance. While it&#8217;s unlikely that there&#8217;s anything seriously wrong,&nbsp;it&#8217;s best to be sure.\nIf&nbsp;your child has had&nbsp;febrile seizures&nbsp;before and the seizure lasts for less than five minutes, phone your GP or the NHS 24 111 service for advice.\nDon&#8217;t put anything, including medication,&nbsp;in your child’s mouth during a seizure because there&#8217;s a slight chance that&nbsp;they might bite their tongue.\nAlmost all children make a complete recovery after having a febrile seizure.\nRead more about&nbsp;diagnosing febrile seizures&nbsp;and treating febrile seizures\nThere are two main types of febrile seizure.\nA simple febrile seizure is the most common type of febrile seizure, accounting for about eight out of 10 cases. It&#8217;s a fit that:\n- is a tonic clonic seizure (see above)\n- lasts less than 15 minutes\n- doesn&#8217;t reoccur within 24 hours or the period in which your child has an illness\nComplex febrile seizures are less common, accounting for two out of 10 cases. A complex febrile seizure is any seizure that has one or more of the following features:\n- the seizure lasts longer than 15 minutes\n- your child only has symptoms in one part of their body (this is known as a partial or focal seizure)\n- your child has another seizure within 24 hours of the first seizure, or during the same period&nbsp;of illness\n- your child doesn&#8217;t fully recover from the seizure within one hour\nThe cause of febrile seizures is unknown, although they&#8217;re linked to the start of a fever (a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above).\nIn most cases, a high temperature is caused by an infection such as:\n- chickenpox\n- flu (influenza)\n- middle ear infections (otitis media) \n- tonsillitis\nThere may also be a genetic link to febrile seizures because the chances of having a seizure are increased if a close family member has a history of them. Around one in four children affected by febrile seizures has a family history of the condition.\nRead more about the causes of febrile seizures\nFebrile seizures have been linked to an increased risk of epilepsy, as well as other problems.\nRecent research findings may indicate a link between febrile seizures and sudden unexplained death in childhood (SUDC), possibly due to the connection between febrile seizures and epilepsy.\nHowever, this link hasn&#8217;t been proven and SUDC is incredibly rare, affecting around one in 100,000 children which is equivalent to a 0.001% chance.\nIn addition, one of the biggest studies of its kind looked at more than 1.5 million children with a history of febrile seizures and found no evidence of an increased risk of death in later childhood or adulthood.\nMany parents worry that if their child has one or more febrile seizures, they&#8217;ll develop epilepsy when they get older. Epilepsy is a condition where a person has repeated seizures without fever.\nWhile it&#8217;s true that children who have a history of febrile seizures have an increased risk of developing epilepsy, it should be stressed that the risk is still small.\nIt&#8217;s estimated that children with a history of simple febrile seizures have a one in 50 chance of developing epilepsy in later life. Children with a history of complex febrile seizures have a one in 20 chance of developing epilepsy in later life.\nThis is compared to around a one in 100 chance for people who haven&#8217;t had febrile seizures.\nThe main symptom of a febrile seizure is a fit that occurs while a child has a fever.\nFebrile seizures often occur during the first day of a fever, which is defined as a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above.&nbsp;\nHowever, there appears to be no connection between the extent of your child’s fever and the start of a seizure. Seizures can occur even if your child has a mild fever.\nSimple febrile seizures&nbsp;can&nbsp;happen when there&#8217;s a rapid rise in temperature&nbsp;and you may only realise your child is ill when they have a fit.&nbsp;Alternatively,&nbsp;they can occur as your child’s temperature drops from a high level.\nDuring simple febrile seizures:\n- your child’s body will become stiff and their arms and legs will begin to twitch\n- they&#8217;ll lose consciousness and they may wet or soil themselves\n- they&nbsp;may also vomit and foam at the mouth and their eyes may roll back\n- the seizure usually lasts for less than five minutes\n- following the seizure, your child may be sleepy for up to an hour afterwards\nComplex febrile seizures&nbsp;tend to last longer than 15 minutes, and the symptoms may only affect one area of your child&#8217;s body. The seizure sometimes recurs within 24 hours or during the period in which your child is ill.\nYou should take your child to hospital or dial 999 for an ambulance if:\n- your child is having a fit for the first time\n- the seizure lasts longer than five minutes and&nbsp;shows no signs of stopping\n- you suspect the seizure is being caused by another serious illness, for example meningitis\n- your child is having breathing difficulties\nIf your child has previously had febrile seizures, it&#8217;s recommended that you telephone your GP or call the NHS 24 111 service for advice.\nYou should also contact your GP or the NHS 24 111 service if your child shows&nbsp;signs and symptoms of&nbsp;dehydration (a lack of fluid in the body). This includes:\n- a&nbsp;dry mouth\n- sunken eyes\n- a lack of tears when crying\n- a sunken fontanelle – the soft spot usually found at the top of a young child’s head\nFebrile seizures are linked to fevers, but the exact cause is unknown.\nSome researchers think that the biological processes associated with a high temperature may be responsible.\nA high temperature is thought to be caused by a bacterial or viral infection that stimulates the release of cytokines. Cytokines are proteins that affect the parts of the brain and nervous system responsible for regulating the body’s temperature. Their release causes a rise in the body&#8217;s temperature.\nOne theory is that in certain people, high levels of cytokines may temporarily ‘scramble’ the workings of the brain and nervous system, triggering a seizure.\nAlthough&nbsp;febrile seizures are poorly understood, a family history of the conditions is thought to increase the risk.&nbsp;\nIf a child has a first-degree relative (mother, father, sister or brother) with a history of febrile seizures, their risk of having seizures increases. The more relatives affected, the higher the risk.\nThis is probably the result of one or more genetic mutations that a child inherits from their parents, which makes them more susceptible to seizures. A genetic mutation means the instructions carried in certain genes&nbsp;become ‘scrambled’, resulting in some of the body’s processes not working in the normal way.\nMost febrile seizures occur when&nbsp;a child has a high temperature caused by an infection. The three most common infections associated with febrile convulsions are:\n- viral infections, such as&nbsp;chickenpox and flu\n- middle ear infections (otitis media)\n- tonsillitis\nOther infections associated with febrile seizures are:\n- urinary tract infections&nbsp;(UTIs)\n- upper&nbsp;respiratory tract infection&nbsp;– an infection of the mouth, nose and throat, and associated tissues and structures\n- gastroenteritis&nbsp;– an infection of the digestive system\n- lower respiratory tract infections, such as pneumonia (a lung infection) and bronchitis (an infection of the airways that supply the lungs)\nIn rare cases, febrile seizures can occur after a child has a vaccination. Research has shown that your child has a one in 3,000 to 4,000 chance of having a febrile seizure after having the MMR vaccine.\nThe risks are even lower with the DTaP/IPV/Hib vaccine – a one in 11,000 to 16,000.\nFebrile seizures can often be diagnosed from a description of what happened.\nFurther tests may be needed if the cause of the associated infection isn&#8217;t clear.\nIt&#8217;s unlikely that your doctor&nbsp;will see the seizure, so an account of what happened&nbsp;is useful.\nIt&#8217;s useful to know:\n- how long the seizure lasted\n- what happened – body stiffening, twitching of the face, arms and legs, staring and loss of consciousness\n- whether your child recovered within one hour\n- whether they&#8217;ve had a seizure before\nTests to identify the source of the infection will only usually be necessary to rule out rarer conditions which can cause similar symptoms, such as meningitis.\nA blood or urine sample may be needed to test for signs of infection. It can sometimes be difficult to obtain a urine sample from young children, so it may have to be done in hospital.\nRead more about blood tests\nFurther tests may be carried out in hospital if your child’s symptoms are unusual – for example, if they don&#8217;t have a high temperature or their seizures don&#8217;t follow the normal pattern.\nFurther testing and observation in hospital is also usually recommended if your child is having complex febrile seizures.\nYour child may have other tests including an electroencephalogram and lumbar puncture, particularly if they&#8217;re less than 12 months old.\nThese two tests&nbsp;are explained below.\nAn&nbsp;electroencephalogram (EEG) measures your child’s electrical brain activity through electrodes that are placed on their scalp. Unusual patterns of brain activity can sometimes indicate epilepsy.\nHowever, some studies have suggested that an EEG may not be useful in many cases of febrile seizures.\nDuring a lumbar puncture, a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is removed for testing. CSF is a clear fluid that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord.\nA hollow needle is inserted into the base of the spine to obtain the CSF sample. During the procedure, local anaesthetic will be used to numb your child’s back so that they don&#8217;t feel any pain.\nA lumbar puncture can be used to determine whether your child has an infection of the brain or nervous system.\nIn many cases, febrile seizures do not need to be treated, although care should be taken to deal with a seizure as it happens.\nIf your child is having a febrile seizure, place them in the recovery position. Lay them on their side, on a soft surface, with their face turned to one side. This will stop them swallowing any vomit, and will keep their airway open and help prevent injury.\nStay with your child while they&#8217;re having a seizure, and make a note of when the seizure started to keep track of how long it lasts. If the seizure lasts for less than five minutes, phone your GP or call the NHS 24 111 service.\nIf it&#8217;s your child&#8217;s first seizure, or if it lasts longer than five minutes,&nbsp;take your child to the nearest hospital&nbsp;as soon as possible.\nWhile there&#8217;s probably nothing seriously wrong with your child, it&#8217;s best to be sure.\nDon&#8217;t put anything, including medication,&nbsp;in your child’s mouth while they&#8217;re having a seizure. There&#8217;s a slight chance that they might bite their tongue, although any damage isn&#8217;t usually serious and will heal within a few days.\nTrying to stop someone biting their tongue by placing your hand or an object in their mouth could be dangerous both for you and for&nbsp;them.\nReducing a high temperature can help make your child feel more comfortable. Paracetamol&nbsp;and&nbsp;ibuprofen have been shown to be effective in reducing a high temperature. However, they won&#8217;t reduce the&nbsp;chances of your child actually having a seizure.\nRemoving any unnecessary clothes and bedding will also help to lower your child’s temperature.\nAspirin should never be given to children&nbsp;under 16 years of age because there&#8217;s a small risk that the medication could trigger a condition called Reye’s syndrome, which can cause brain and liver damage.\nThe use of cold sponges or fans isn&#8217;t recommended for treating a high temperature. There&#8217;s little evidence that they&#8217;re effective, and they may cause your child discomfort. Your GP will be able to give you additional advice about treating the underlying cause of your child’s high temperature.\nIt&#8217;s also important to prevent&nbsp;dehydration during a fever by making sure your child drinks plenty of fluids.\nAbout one third of children will have a febrile seizure again during a subsequent infection. This often occurs within a year of the first febrile seizure.\nRecurrence is more likely if:\n- the first febrile seizure occurred before your child was 18 months old\n- there&#8217;s a history of seizures or epilepsy in your family\n- before having the first seizure your child had a fever that lasted less than one&nbsp;hour or their temperature was less than 40C (104F)&nbsp;\n- your child has multiple seizures during the same febrile episode (complex febrile seizure)\n- your child attends a day care nursery (this increases their chances of developing common childhood infections, such as the&nbsp;flu or chickenpox)\nIt&#8217;s&nbsp;not recommended that your child is given a prescription of regular medicines to prevent further febrile seizures. This is because the adverse side effects associated with many medicines outweigh any risks&nbsp;of the seizures themselves.\nResearch has shown that the use of medication to control fever&nbsp;isn&#8217;t likely to prevent recurrence of further febrile seizures.\nHowever, there may be exceptional circumstances where medication to prevent recurrent febrile seizures is recommended. For example, children may need medication if they have a low threshold for having seizures during illness, particularly if the seizures are prolonged.\nIn this case, your child may be prescribed medications such as diazepam or lorazepam to take at the start of a fever.\nChildren who&#8217;ve had a febrile seizure following a routine vaccination (which is very rare), are no more at risk of having another seizure compared to children who&#8217;ve had a seizure due to another cause for fever."

You can&#8217;t give them both at the same time, but if one doesn&#8217;t work, you may want to try the other later.\nAntipyretics aren&#8217;t always needed. If your child isn&#8217;t distressed by the fever or underlying illness, there&#8217;s no need to use antipyretics to reduce a fever.\nAlways read the patient information leaflet that comes with the medication.

There&#8217;s no specific test to diagnose the condition.\nThe symptoms of fibromyalgia can vary. The symptoms can be similar to those of several other conditions. Your GP will have to rule out other conditions with similar symptoms.\nYou&#8217;ll be asked about how your symptoms are affecting your daily life. You&#8217;ll be examined to check for signs of other conditions. They&#8217;ll check for swollen joints which might suggest arthritis, rather than fibromyalgia.\nTests to check for some of these conditions include urine and blood tests. You may also have X-rays and other scans. If you&#8217;re found to have another condition, you could still have fibromyalgia as well.\nFor fibromyalgia to be diagnosed, certain criteria usually have to be met. The most widely used criteria for diagnosis are:\n- you have pain in multiple areas of your body\n- your symptoms have stayed at a similar level for at least 3months\n- your symptoms can&#8217;t be explained by any other reason\n- you feel unrefreshed after sleep\n- you have problems thinking or remembering (cognitive difficulties)\n- you experience fatigue\nIt&#8217;s also possible to have other conditions alongside fibromyalgia, like:\n- depression\n- anxiety\n- irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\n- osteoarthritis\n- hypermobility spectrum disorder\nIdentifying all possible conditions will help to guide your treatment.\nFibromyalgia is a long term (chronic) condition.\nThere&#8217;s no cure for fibromyalgia.

Some common symptoms include:\n- an itchy sensation inside the mouth, throat or ears\n- a raised itchy red rash (urticaria,&nbsp;or &#8220;hives&#8221;)\n- swelling of the face, around the eyes, lips, tongue and roof of the mouth&nbsp;(angioedema)\n- vomiting\nRead more about the&nbsp;symptoms of food allergies\nIn the most serious cases, a person&nbsp;has a&nbsp;severe allergic reaction&nbsp;(anaphylaxis), which can be life threatening.\nIf you think someone has the&nbsp;symptoms of anaphylaxis&nbsp;–&nbsp;such as breathing difficulties, lightheadedness, and feeling like they&#8217;re going to faint or lose consciousness&nbsp;–&nbsp;call 999.\nAsk for an ambulance and tell the operator you think the person has anaphylaxis or &#8220;anaphylactic shock&#8221;.\nFood allergies happen when the immune system&nbsp;– the body&#8217;s defence against infection&nbsp;– mistakenly treats proteins found in food as a threat.\nAs a result, a number of chemicals are released. It&#8217;s these chemicals that cause the symptoms of an allergic reaction.\nAlmost any food can cause an allergic reaction, but there are certain foods that are responsible for&nbsp;most food allergies.\nIn children, the foods that most commonly cause an allergic reaction are:\n- milk\n- eggs\n- peanuts\n- tree nuts\n- fish\n- shellfish\nMost children that have a food allergy will have experienced&nbsp;eczema&nbsp;during infancy. The worse the child&#8217;s eczema and the earlier it started, the more likely&nbsp;they are to have a food allergy.\nIn adults, the foods that most commonly cause an allergic reaction are:\n- peanuts\n- tree nuts&nbsp;–&nbsp;such as walnuts, brazil nuts, almonds and hazelnuts\n- fruits&nbsp;– such as apples and peaches\n- fish\n- shellfish –&nbsp;such as crab, lobster and prawns\nIt&#8217;s still unknown why people develop allergies to food, although they often have other allergic conditions, such as&nbsp;asthma,&nbsp;hay fever&nbsp;and eczema.\nRead more information about the&nbsp;causes and risk factors for food allergies\nFood allergies are divided into three types, depending on symptoms and when they occur.\n- IgE-mediated food allergy&nbsp;–&nbsp;the most common type, triggered by the immune system producing an antibody called immunoglobulin E (IgE). Symptoms occur&nbsp;a few seconds or minutes after eating. There&#8217;s a greater risk of anaphylaxis with this type of allergy.\n- non-IgE-mediated food allergy&nbsp;–&nbsp;these allergic reactions aren&#8217;t caused by immunoglobulin E, but by other cells in the immune system. This type of allergy is often difficult to diagnose as symptoms take much longer to develop (up to several hours).\n- mixed IgE and non-IgE-mediated food allergies&nbsp;–&nbsp;some people may experience symptoms from both types.\nRead more information about the&nbsp;symptoms of a food allergy\nSome people experience&nbsp;itchiness in their mouth and throat, sometimes with mild swelling, immediately after eating fresh fruit or vegetables. This is known as oral allergy syndrome.\nOral allergy syndrome&nbsp;is caused by allergy antibodies mistaking certain&nbsp;proteins&nbsp;in fresh fruits, nuts or vegetables for pollen.\nOral allergy syndrome generally doesn&#8217;t cause severe symptoms, and it&#8217;s possible to deactivate the allergens by thoroughly cooking any fruit and vegetables.\nSome people with pollen-food syndrome may have more severe symptoms.\nThe Allergy UK website has more information on oral allergy syndrome.\nThe best way of preventing an allergic reaction is to identify the food that causes the allergy and avoid it.\nResearch is currently looking at ways to desensitise some food allergens, such as peanuts and milk, but this is not an established treatment.\nRead more about&nbsp;identifying foods that cause allergies (allergens)\nAvoid making any radical changes,&nbsp;such as cutting out dairy products,&nbsp;to your or your child&#8217;s diet without first talking to your GP. For some foods, such as milk, you may need to speak to a dietitian before making any changes.\nA type of medication called an&nbsp;antihistamine&nbsp;can help relieve the symptoms of a mild or moderate allergic reaction. A higher dose of antihistamine is often needed to control acute allergic symptoms.\nAdrenaline is an effective treatment for more severe allergic symptoms, such as&nbsp;anaphylaxis.\nPeople with a food allergy are often given a device known as an auto-injector pen, which contains doses of adrenaline that can be used in emergencies.\nRead more about the&nbsp;treatment of food allergies\nIf you think you or your child may have a food allergy, it&#8217;s very important to ask for a professional diagnosis from your GP. They can then refer you to an allergy clinic if appropriate.\nMany parents mistakenly&nbsp;assume their child&nbsp;has a food allergy when their symptoms are actually&nbsp;caused by&nbsp;a completely different&nbsp;condition.\nCommercial allergy testing kits are available, but using them isn&#8217;t recommended. Many kits are based on unsound scientific principles. Even if they&#8217;re reliable, you should have the results looked at by a health professional.\nRead more about&nbsp;diagnosing food allergies\nMost food allergies affect younger children under the age of three. It&#8217;s estimated around&nbsp;1 in every 14 children of this age has at least one food allergy.\nMost children&nbsp;who have&nbsp;food allergies to milk, eggs, soya and wheat in early life will grow out of it by the time they start school.\nPeanut and tree nut allergies are usually more persistent. An estimated four out of&nbsp;five children with peanut allergies remain allergic to peanuts for the rest of their lives.\nFood allergies that develop during adulthood, or persist into adulthood, are likely to be lifelong allergies.\nFor reasons that are unclear, rates of food allergies have risen sharply in the last&nbsp;20 years.\nHowever, deaths from anaphylaxis-related food reactions are now rare.\nThe symptoms of a food allergy&nbsp;almost always develop a&nbsp;few seconds or minutes after eating the food.\nSome people may develop a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), which can be life threatening.\nThe&nbsp;most common type of&nbsp;allergic reaction to food is known as an IgE-mediated food allergy.\nSymptoms include:\n- tingling or itching in the mouth\n- a raised, itchy red rash (urticarial) – in some cases, the skin can turn red and itchy, but without a raised rash\n- swelling of the face, mouth&nbsp;(angioedema), throat&nbsp;or other areas of the body\n- difficulty swallowing\n- wheezing or shortness of breath\n- feeling&nbsp;dizzy and lightheaded\n- feeling sick (nausea) or vomiting\n- abdominal pain or&nbsp;diarrhoea\n- hay fever-like symptoms, such as sneezing or itchy eyes&nbsp;(allergic conjunctivitus)&nbsp;\nThe symptoms of a severe allergic reaction&nbsp;(anaphylaxis)&nbsp;can be sudden and get worse very quickly.\nInitial&nbsp;symptoms of anaphylaxis&nbsp;are often the same as those listed above and can lead to:\n- increased breathing difficulties&nbsp;–&nbsp;such as wheezing and a cough\n- a sudden and intense feeling of anxiety and fear\n- a rapid heartbeat (tachycardia)\n- a sharp and sudden drop in your blood pressure, which can make you feel lightheaded and confused\n- unconsciousness\nAnaphylaxis is a medical emergency. Without quick treatment, it can be life threatening. If you think you or someone you know is experiencing anaphylaxis, dial 999 and ask for an ambulance as soon as possible.\nAnother type of&nbsp;allergic reaction is a non-IgE-mediated food allergy. The symptoms of this type of allergy can&nbsp;take much longer to develop&nbsp;– sometimes&nbsp;up to several days.\nSome symptoms of a non IgE-mediated food allergy&nbsp;may be what you would expect to see in an allergic reaction, such as:\n- redness and itchiness of the skin&nbsp;–&nbsp;although not a raised, itchy red rash&nbsp;(urticarial)\n- the skin becomes itchy, red, dry and cracked&nbsp;(atopic eczema)\nOther symptoms can be much less obvious and are sometimes thought of as being caused by something other than an allergy. They include:\n- heartburn and indigestion caused by stomach acid leaking up out of the stomach&nbsp;(gastro-oesophageal reflux disease)\n- stools (faeces)&nbsp;becoming much more frequent or loose&nbsp;– though not necessarily diarrhoea\n- blood and mucus in the stools\n- in babies&nbsp;–&nbsp;excessive and inconsolable crying, even though the baby is well fed and doesn&#8217;t need a nappy change (colic)\n- constipation&nbsp;\n- redness around the anus, rectum and genitals\n- unusually pale skin\n- failure to grow at the expected rate\nSome children can have a mixed reaction where they experience both IgE symptoms, such as swelling, and non-IgE symptoms, such as constipation.\nThis can happen to children who have a milk allergy.\nA food allergy is caused&nbsp;by your immune system handling harmless proteins in certain foods as a threat. It releases a number of chemicals, which trigger an allergic reaction.\nThe immune system protects the body by producing specialised proteins called antibodies.\nAntibodies identify potential threats to your body, such as bacteria and viruses. They signal your immune system to release chemicals to kill the threat and prevent the spread of infection.\nIn the most common type of food allergy, an antibody known as immunoglobulin E (IgE) mistakenly targets a certain protein found in food as a threat. IgE can cause&nbsp;several chemicals to be released, the most important being histamine.\nHistamine causes most of the typical symptoms that occur during an allergic reaction. For example, histamine:\n- causes small blood vessels to expand and the surrounding skin to become red and swell up\n- affects nerves in the skin, causing itchiness\n- increases the amount of mucus produced in your nose lining, which causes itching and a burning sensation\nIn most food allergies, the release of histamine is limited to certain parts of the body, such as your mouth, throat or skin.\nIn&nbsp;anaphylaxis, the immune system goes into overdrive and releases massive amounts of histamine and many other chemicals&nbsp;into your blood. This causes the wide range of symptoms associated with anaphylaxis.\nThere&#8217;s another type of food allergy known as a non-IgE-mediated food allergy, caused by different cells in the immune system.\nThis is much harder to diagnose as there&#8217;s no test to accurately confirm non-IgE-mediated food allergy.\nThis type of reaction is largely confined to the skin and digestive system, causing symptoms such as heartburn, indigestion and eczema.\nIn babies, a&nbsp;non-IgE-mediated food allergy can also cause diarrhoea and reflux, where stomach acid leaks up into the throat.\nIn children, the foods that most commonly cause an allergic reaction are:\n- eggs\n- milk&nbsp;–&nbsp;if a child has an allergy to cow&#8217;s milk, they&#8217;re probably allergic to all types of milk, as well as infants&#8217; and follow-on formula\n- soya\n- wheat\n- peanuts\nIn adults, the foods that most commonly cause an allergic reaction are:\n- peanuts\n- tree nuts&nbsp;–&nbsp;such as walnuts, brazil nuts, almonds and pistachios\n- fish\n- shellfish&nbsp;– such as crab, lobster and prawns\nHowever, any type of food can potentially cause an allergy. Allergic reactions have been reported in association with:\n- celery or celeriac&nbsp;–&nbsp;this can sometimes cause anaphylactic shock\n- gluten&nbsp;–&nbsp;a type of protein found in cereals\n- mustard\n- sesame seeds\n- fruit and vegetables&nbsp;–&nbsp;these usually only cause symptoms affecting the mouth, lips and throat (oral allergy syndrome)\n- pine nuts (a type of seed)\n- meat&nbsp;–&nbsp;some people are allergic to just one type of meat, while others are allergic to a range of meats; a common symptom is skin irritation\nExactly what causes the immune system to mistake harmless proteins as a threat is unclear. However, a number of risk factors for food allergies have been identified, which are outlined below.\nIf you have a parent, brother or sister with an allergic condition&nbsp;–&nbsp;such as asthma, eczema or a food allergy&nbsp;–&nbsp;you have a slightly higher risk of developing a food allergy. However, you may not develop the same food allergy as your family members.\nChildren who&nbsp;have atopic dermatitis (eczema) in early life are more likely to develop a food allergy.\nThe number of people with food allergies has risen sharply over the past few decades and,&nbsp;although the reason is unclear, other allergic conditions such as atopic dermatitis have also increased.\nOne theory behind the rise is that a typical child&#8217;s diet has changed considerably over the last 30 to 40 years.\nAnother theory is that children are increasingly growing up in &#8220;germ-free&#8221; environments. This means their immune systems may not receive sufficient early exposure to the germs needed to develop properly. This is known as the hygiene hypothesis.\nIt&#8217;s rare for someone to&nbsp;have an&nbsp;allergic&nbsp;reaction to food additives. However,&nbsp;certain additives&nbsp;may cause&nbsp;a flare-up of symptoms in people with pre-existing&nbsp;conditions.\nSulphur dioxide (E220) and other sulphites (E221, E222, E223, E224, E226, E227 and E228) are used as preservatives in a wide range of foods, especially soft drinks, sausages, burgers, and dried fruits and vegetables.\nSulphur dioxide is produced naturally when wine and beer are made, and is&nbsp;sometimes added to wine. Anyone who has&nbsp;asthma&nbsp;or&nbsp;allergic rhinitis&nbsp;may react to inhaling sulphur dioxide.\nA few people with asthma have had an attack after drinking acidic drinks containing sulphites, but this isn&#8217;t thought to be very common.\nFood labelling rules require pre-packed food sold in the UK, and the rest of the European Union, to show clearly on the label if it contains sulphur dioxide or sulphites at levels above 10mg per kg or per litre.\nBenzoic acid (E210) and other benzoates (E211, E212, E213, E214, E215, E218 and E219) are used as food preservatives to prevent yeasts and moulds growing, most commonly in soft drinks. They occur naturally in fruit and honey.\nBenzoates could make the symptoms of asthma and&nbsp;eczema&nbsp;worse in children who already have these conditions.\nIf you think you or your child has a food allergy, make an appointment with your GP.\nThey&nbsp;will ask you&nbsp;some questions about the pattern of your child&#8217;s symptoms, such as:\n- how long did it take for the symptoms to start after exposure to the food?\n- how long did the symptoms last?\n- how severe were the symptoms?\n- is this the first time these symptoms have occurred? If not, how often have they&nbsp;occurred?\n- what food was involved and how much of it did your child eat?\nThey&#8217;ll also want to know about your child&#8217;s medical history, such as:\n- do they have any other allergies or allergic conditions?\n- is there a history of allergies in the family?\n- was (or is) your child breastfed or bottle-fed?\nYour GP may also assess your child&#8217;s weight and size to make sure they&#8217;re growing at the expected rate.\nIf your GP suspects a food allergy, you may be referred to an allergy clinic or centre for testing.\nThe tests needed can vary, depending on the type of allergy:\n- if the symptoms&nbsp;developed quickly (an IgE-mediated food allergy)&nbsp;–&nbsp;you&#8217;ll probably be given a skin-prick test or a&nbsp;blood test\n- if the symptoms developed more slowly (non-IgE-mediated food allergy)&nbsp;–&nbsp;you&#8217;ll probably be put on a food elimination diet\nThere is more information on these tests below.\nDuring&nbsp;a skin-prick test, drops of&nbsp;standardised extracts&nbsp;of&nbsp;foods are placed on the arm. The skin is then pierced with a small&nbsp;lancet, which allows the allergen to come into contact with the&nbsp;cells of your immune system.\nOccasionally, your doctor may&nbsp;perform the&nbsp;test using a sample of the food thought to cause a reaction.\nItching, redness and swelling usually indicates a positive reaction. This test is usually painless.\nA skin-prick test does have a small theoretical chance of causing anaphylaxis, but testing will be carried out where there are facilities to deal with&nbsp;this&nbsp;–&nbsp;usually an allergy clinic, hospital, or larger GP surgery.\nAn alternative to a skin-prick test is a blood test, which measures the amount of allergic antibodies in the blood.\nIn a food elimination diet, the food thought to have caused the allergic reaction is withdrawn&nbsp;from&nbsp;the diet for&nbsp;two to six&nbsp;weeks. The food is then reintroduced.\nIf the symptoms go away when the food is withdrawn&nbsp;but&nbsp;return once the food is introduced again, this normally suggests a food allergy or intolerance.\nBefore starting the diet, you should be given advice from a dietitian on issues such as:\n- the&nbsp;food and drinks you need to avoid\n- how you should interpret food labels\n- if any alternative sources of nutrition are needed\n- how long the diet should last\nDon&#8217;t attempt a food elimination diet by yourself without discussing it&nbsp;with a qualified health professional.\nThere are&nbsp;several shop-bought tests available that claim to detect allergies,&nbsp;but should be avoided.\nThey include:\n- vega testing&nbsp;–&nbsp;claims to detect allergies by measuring changes in your electromagnetic field\n- kinesiology testing&nbsp;–&nbsp;claims to detect food allergies by studying your muscle responses\n- hair analysis&nbsp;–&nbsp;claims to detect food allergies by taking a sample of your hair and running a series of tests on it\n- alternative blood tests (leukocytotoxic tests)&nbsp;–&nbsp;claim to detect food allergies by checking for the &#8220;swelling of white blood cells&#8221;\nMany alternative testing kits are expensive, the scientific principles they are allegedly based on are unproven, and independent reviews have found them to be unreliable. They should therefore be avoided.\nThe advice here is primarily written for parents of a child with a food allergy. However, most of it is also relevant&nbsp;if you&#8217;re an adult with a food allergy.\nThere&#8217;s currently&nbsp;no cure for food allergies, although many children will grow out of certain ones, such as allergies to milk and eggs.\nThe most effective way you can prevent symptoms is to remove the offending food&nbsp;– known as an allergen&nbsp;–&nbsp;from their diet.\nHowever,&nbsp;it&#8217;s important to check with your GP or the doctor in charge of your child&#8217;s care first before eliminating certain foods.\nRemoving eggs or peanuts from a child&#8217;s diet isn&#8217;t going to have much of an impact on their nutrition. Both&nbsp;of these are a good source of protein, but can be replaced by other, alternative sources.\nA milk allergy can have more of an impact as milk is a good source of calcium, but&nbsp;there are&nbsp;many other ways you can incorporate calcium into your child&#8217;s diet, including green leafy vegetables. Many foods and drinks are fortified with extra calcium.\nSee your GP if you&#8217;re concerned that your child&#8217;s allergy is affecting their growth and development.\nIt&#8217;s very important to check the label of any pre-packed food or drinks your child has in case it contains ingredients they&#8217;re allergic to.\nUnder&nbsp;EU law, any pre-packed food or drink sold in the UK must clearly state on the label if it contains the following ingredients:\n- celery\n- cereals that contain gluten&nbsp;– including wheat, rye, barley and oats\n- crustaceans&nbsp;– including prawns, crabs and lobsters\n- eggs\n- fish\n- lupin&nbsp;(common garden plants) – seeds from some varieties are sometimes used to make flour\n- milk\n- molluscs&nbsp;– including mussels and oysters\n- mustard\n- tree nuts&nbsp;–&nbsp;such as almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, brazil nuts, cashews, pecans, pistachios and macadamia nuts\n- peanuts\n- sesame seeds\n- soybeans\n- sulphur dioxide and sulphites&nbsp;(preservatives used in some foods and drinks)&nbsp;–&nbsp;at levels above 10mg per kg or per litre\nSome food manufacturers also choose to put allergy advice warning labels&nbsp;– for example, &#8220;contains nuts&#8221;&nbsp;–&nbsp;on their pre-packed foods if they contain an ingredient known to commonly cause an allergic reaction, such as peanuts, wheat, eggs or milk.\nHowever, these aren&#8217;t compulsory. If there&#8217;s no allergy advice box or &#8220;contains&#8221; statement on a product, it could still have any of the 14 specified allergens in it.\nLook out for &#8220;may contain&#8221; labels, such as &#8220;may contain traces of peanut&#8221;. Manufacturers sometimes put this label on their products to warn consumers that they may have become contaminated with another food product when being made.\nRead more detailed information about allergen labelling on the Food Standards Agency website.\nSome non-food products contain allergy-causing food:\n- some soaps and shampoos contain soy, egg and tree nut oil\n- some pet foods contain milk and peanuts\n- some glues and adhesive labels used on envelopes and stamps contain traces of wheat\nAgain, read the labels of any non-food products your child may come into close physical contact with.\nCurrently, unpackaged food doesn&#8217;t need to be labelled in the same way as packaged food. This can make it more difficult to know what ingredients are in a particular dish.\nExamples of unpackaged food include food sold from:\n- bakeries&nbsp;– including in-store bakeries in supermarkets\n- delis\n- salad bars\n- &#8220;ready-to-eat&#8221; sandwich shops\n- takeaways\n- restaurants\nIf you or your child have a severe food allergy, you need to be careful when you eat out.\nThe following advice should help:\n- let the staff know&nbsp;– when booking a table at a restaurant, make sure the staff know about any allergies. Ask for a firm guarantee that the specific food won&#8217;t be in any of the dishes served. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) offers chef cards that provide information about allergies, which you can give to restaurant staff. As well as informing the chef and kitchen staff involved in cooking your food, let waiters and waitresses know so they understand the importance of avoiding cross-contamination when serving you.\n- read the menu carefully and check for hidden ingredients&nbsp;– some food types contain other foods that can trigger allergies, which restaurant staff may have overlooked. Some desserts contain nuts (such as a cheesecake base) and some sauces contain wheat and peanuts.\n- prepare for the worst&nbsp;– it&#8217;s a good idea to prepare for any eventuality. Always take anti-allergy medication with you when eating out, particularly an adrenalin&nbsp;auto-injector. Read more about&nbsp;treating food allergies with a auto-injector.\n- use what&#8217;s known as a taste test in older children&nbsp;– before your child begins to eat, ask them to take a tiny portion of the food and rub it against their lips to see if they experience a tingling or burning sensation. If they do, it suggests that the food will cause them to have an allergic reaction. However, the taste test doesn&#8217;t work for all foods, so it shouldn&#8217;t be used as a substitute for the above advice.\nHere&#8217;s some more advice for parents:&nbsp;\n- notify your child&#8217;s school about their allergy – depending on how severe&nbsp;their allergy is, it may be necessary to give the staff at their school an emergency action plan in case of accidental exposure. Arrange for the school nurse or another staff member to hold a supply of adrenalin. Food allergy bracelets,&nbsp;which explain how other people can help your child in an emergency, are also available.\n- let other parents know&nbsp;– young children may easily forget about their food allergy and accept food they shouldn&#8217;t have when visiting other children. Telling the parents of your child&#8217;s friends about their allergy should help prevent this.\n- educate your child&nbsp;– once your child is old enough to understand their allergy, it&#8217;s important to give them clear, simple instructions about what foods to avoid and what they should do if they accidentally eat them.\nThere are two main types of medication that can be used to relieve the symptoms of an allergic reaction to foods:\n- antihistamines&nbsp;– used to treat mild to moderate allergic reaction\n- adrenaline&nbsp;–&nbsp;used to treat severe allergic reactions&nbsp;(anaphylaxis)\nAntihistamines&nbsp;work by blocking the effects of histamine,&nbsp;which is responsible for many of the symptoms of an allergic reaction.\nMany antihistamines are available from your pharmacist without prescription&nbsp;– stock up in case of an emergency. Non-drowsy antihistamines are preferred.\nSome antihistamines, such as alimemazine and promethazine, aren&#8217;t suitable for children under the age of&nbsp;two.\nIf you have a younger child with a food allergy, ask your GP about what types of antihistamines may be suitable.\nAvoid drinking alcohol after taking an antihistamine as this can make you feel drowsy and affect your ability to drive.\nAdrenaline works by narrowing the blood vessels to counteract the effects of low blood pressure and opening up the airways to help ease breathing difficulties.\nYou&#8217;ll be given an auto-injector of adrenaline to use in case of emergencies if you or your child is at&nbsp;risk of anaphylaxis or had a previous episode of anaphylaxis.\nRead the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions that come with the auto-injector carefully and train your child how to use it when they are old enough.\nIf you suspect that somebody is experiencing the&nbsp;symptoms of anaphylaxis, call&nbsp;999&nbsp;and ask for an ambulance. Tell the operator that you think the person has anaphylaxis.\nOlder children and adults will probably have been trained to inject themselves. You may need to inject younger children or older children and adults who are too sick to inject themselves.\nThere are three types of auto-injectors:\n- EpiPen\n- Jext\n- Emerade\nAll three work in much the same way. If anaphylaxis is suspected, you should remove the safety cap from the injector and press firmly against the thigh, holding it at a right angle, without using the thumb at the end.\nA &#8220;click&#8221; indicates the auto-injector has been activated, and it should be held in place for 10 seconds. Ensure you&#8217;re familiar with the device and know the correct end to place against the thigh.\nThe injections can be given through clothing. This will send a needle into your thigh and deliver a dose of adrenaline.\nIf the person is unconscious, check their airways are open and clear, and check their breathing. Then put them in&nbsp;the recovery position. Putting someone who is unconscious in the recovery position ensures they don&#8217;t choke on their vomit.\nPlace the person on their side, making sure they&#8217;re supported by one leg and one arm. Open the airway by tilting the head and lifting the chin.\nIf the person&#8217;s breathing or heart stops,&nbsp;cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)&nbsp;should be performed.\nAs a precaution, the following advice should be taken:&nbsp;\n- Carry the auto-injector at all times or encourage your child to do so if they&#8217;re old enough. You may be prescribed two injectors –&nbsp;check with your GP or the doctor in charge of your care. You may also be given an emergency card or bracelet with full details of your child&#8217;s allergy and the contact details of their doctor to alert others. They should wear this at all times.\n- Extreme temperatures can make adrenaline less effective. Don&#8217;t leave an auto-injector in places like your fridge or the glove compartment of your car.\n- Check the expiry date regularly.&nbsp;An out-of-date injector will only offer limited protection.\n- The manufacturers offer a reminder service, where you can be contacted near the date of expiry. Check the information leaflet that comes with the medication for more information.\n- If your child has an auto-injector, they&#8217;ll need to change over to an adult dose once they reach a weight of&nbsp;30 kilos (4.7 stone). Depending on the shape and size of your child&#8217;s body, this could be anywhere between the ages of&nbsp;5 and 11 years old.\n- Don&#8217;t delay injecting if you think you or your child may be experiencing the start of anaphylaxis, even if the initial symptoms are mild. It&#8217;s better to use adrenaline early and find out it was a false alarm than delay treatment until you&#8217;re sure your child is experiencing severe anaphylaxis.&nbsp;"

        "description": "This information may be useful for those who have been diagnosed with a fragility fracture of the hip. People who are experiencing new or ongoing symptoms should contact their healthcare professional.\nRead about advice on dealing with a hip problem\nA fragility fracture is a break in the bone from an impact or fall that would not normally be expected to cause a fracture.\nThis can also be known as:\n- a broken hip\n- low-level trauma\n- low-energy trauma\n- a neck of femur (NoF) fracture\nFragility fractures of the hip are most commonly caused by a fall from standing height or less.\nPeople with conditions that cause their bones to weaken, like osteoporosis, have an increased likelihood of a fall causing a fracture. This can happen due to age or other factors.\nRead more about osteoporosis\nMost people with a fractured hip will need an operation under anaesthetic to repair it. If an operation is required it would normally be done as soon as possible in the few days following the injury. A healthcare professional will discuss the different options available to you before any operation takes place.\nIn some circumstances your healthcare professional may suggest a different treatment path. This could be because you have no pain, mild symptoms or that undergoing an operation may not be suitable because of other health concerns.\nMost people who sustain a fractured hip will require extra nutrition to help their bodies recover from the injury and subsequent operation.

        "disease": "Frozen shoulder",
        "description": "This information is useful for those who have been diagnosed with a frozen shoulder.  People who are experiencing new or ongoing symptoms should contact their healthcare professional. &nbsp;\nRead more about self-managing a shoulder problem\nFrozen shoulder is a condition that leads to pain and stiffness of the shoulder. It&#8217;s also known as adhesive capsulitis or shoulder contracture.\nTypically, you&#8217;ll experience shoulder pain which can become more severe over a number of months. This is usually followed by increasing stiffness.\nThe stiffness may affect your ability to carry out everyday activities. In particularly severe cases, you may not be able to move your shoulder at all.\nFrozen shoulder occurs when the flexible tissue that surrounds the shoulder joint, known as the capsule, becomes inflamed and thickened. It&#8217;s not fully understood why this process happens. This can happen in one or both shoulders.\nThis condition can appear without any apparent reason, however, your risk of developing a frozen shoulder can increase if you have:\n- a previous shoulder injury or shoulder surgery\n- diabetes or a thyroid problem\n- Dupuytren&#8217;s contracture – a condition where small lumps of thickened tissue form in the hands and fingers\n- other health conditions, such as heart disease and stroke\nPain and persistent stiffness in the shoulder joint are the two main symptoms of a frozen shoulder.\nThis makes it painful and difficult to carry out the full range of normal shoulder movements. You may find it difficult to perform everyday tasks, such as:\n- bathing\n- dressing\n- driving\n- sleeping comfortably\nSymptoms vary from mild, with little difference to daily activities, to severe, where it may not be possible to move your shoulder at all.\nThe symptoms of a frozen shoulder usually get worse gradually, over a number of months.\nThere are three separate stages to the condition but sometimes these stages may be difficult to distinguish. The symptoms may also vary greatly from person to person.\nDuring stage one, often referred to as the &#8220;freezing&#8221; phase, your shoulder starts to ache and can become very painful, for example, when reaching out for things.\nThe pain is often worse at night and when you lie on the affected side. This stage can last anywhere from 2-9 months.\nStage two is often known as the &#8220;frozen&#8221; phase. Your shoulder may become increasingly stiff, but the pain doesn&#8217;t usually get worse and may even decrease.\nThe stiffness in your shoulder can continue to affect your day to day activities. This stage usually lasts 4-12 months.\nStage three is known as the &#8220;thawing&#8221; phase. During this period, you&#8217;ll gradually regain movement in your shoulder.\nIf pain is still present it should start to fade, although it may come back occasionally as the stiffness eases. This stage can last 12 months or more.\nIn order for a frozen shoulder to be diagnosed you&#8217;ll need an assessment from a healthcare professional.\nThey&#8217;ll initially ask you questions about your shoulder issue and then carry out a physical examination. This will include checking your range of movement and strength.\nYou may sometimes need to have a further examination to rule out other possible health conditions.\nTreatment options depend on the severity of your symptoms. Although, most cases improve on their own, some cases can take over a year to resolve.\nDuring the painful phase the emphasis is on pain relief. Pain medication can help you move more comfortably, which can help your recovery.\nMore about taking painkillers.\nIt may also help to use heat or ice packs.\nExercise&nbsp;\nTargeted shoulder exercises to encourage movement, stretching and strengthening exercises can help to improve your arm movement and pain.&nbsp;\nThe British Elbow and Shoulder Society have a video with specific exercises to help with a frozen shoulder.\nStop these exercises if they make your symptoms worse, or if they cause new pain.\nIf your shoulder pain worsens while following this advice, it’s a good idea to talk to a healthcare professional about your symptoms.\nCorticosteroid Injections\nIf painkillers aren&#8217;t helping to control the pain, your healthcare professional may discuss the option of having a corticosteroid injection into your shoulder joint.\nCorticosteroids are medicines that help reduce pain and inflammation. They may also be given with a local anaesthetic.\nInjections won&#8217;t cure your condition or reduce shoulder stiffness, they are used to help with the pain.\nRead more about corticosteroids\nA frozen shoulder can sometimes mean you need to take some time off work to help recovery. How long you&#8217;re off will depend on the nature of your condition and your role at work.\nYou do not need to be symptom free before you consider returning to work. Continuing to go to work, or returning to work as soon as is possible for you, will help your recovery. Gradually getting back to your normal daily activities can help to build up your strength and stamina levels.\nFollowing this advice, you should see gradual improvements over time.\nIf your frozen shoulder hasn’t improved, or it&#8217;s got worse, within 6 weeks of following this advice, it’s a good idea to contact a healthcare professional about your symptoms.\nFind out how to access MSK services in your area.\nWhen dealing with any health condition it&#8217;s important to also look after your mental wellbeing as this can impact your recovery."

        "disease": "Functional neurological disorder (FND)",
        "description": "Functional neurological disorder (FND) describes a problem with how the brain receives and sends information to the rest of the body.\nIt’s often helpful to think of your brain as a computer. In someone who has FND, there’s no damage to the hardware, or structure, of the brain. It’s the software, or program running on the computer, that isn’t working properly.\nThe problems that cause FND are going on in a level of the brain that you cannot control. It includes symptoms like arm and leg weakness and seizures. Other symptoms like fatigue or pain are not directly caused by FND, but are often found alongside it.\nFND can have many symptoms that can vary from person to person. Some people may have few symptoms, and some people may have many.\nA diagnosis of FND should be made because you have one or more clinical features that a specialist can recognise as typical of FND. It shouldn&#8217;t be made just because scans or tests for other neurological conditions that have similar symptoms are normal.\nA clinical feature is a distinctive way that your symptom presents that is unique to FND. For example, it could be that your eyes close during seizures, or that limb weakness briefly disappears during certain physical tests. Clinical features are what specialists use to identify FND from other neurological conditions with similar symptoms.\nFunctional limb weakness is when a leg or an arm doesn’t work properly. In FND, this happens because of a problem with how the nervous system is functioning.\nIt can cause a range of symptoms, including:\n- problems walking\n- heaviness down one side\n- dropping things\n- feeling like a limb isn’t part of you\nFunctional limb weakness can often look a symptoms of a stroke or multiple sclerosis. If you have FND, any scans you have will show no damage to the brain to explain the weakness.\nA specialist will diagnose functional limb weakness based on specific clinical features (symptoms) they find when they examine you.\nRead more about functional limb weakness\nA functional seizure (also called a dissociative seizure) is an episode where someone loses either their awareness of, or their ability to interact with, their surroundings. It may look like an epileptic seizure or a faint.\nA functional seizure can appear as:\n- uncontrolled shaking\n- suddenly going motionless and unresponsive\n- staring without responding to surroundings\nSome people are aware that seizures are about to happen, while others experience them without warning.\nA specialist will ask you and your friends or family about what happens during a seizure, and will look at any video footage you can provide. They&#8217;ll use this evidence to decide if it’s epilepsy, a faint or a functional seizure.\nRead more about functional seizures\nTremor is uncontrollable shaking of part of the body. It’s most often found in the arms and legs.\nFunctional tremor can come and go throughout the day, and change in speed and strength.\nA specialist will diagnose functional tremor based on specific features of your symptoms that they find when they examine you.\nRead more about functional tremor\nFunctional dystonia is a type of muscle spasm. It causes a part of the body to become stuck in an unusual position. This can be for a short or a long period of time.\nSomeone with functional dystonia will often present with curled fingers, a clenched hand, or an ankle that turns in.\nRead more about functional dystonia\nFunctional gait disorder describes the problems walking that you may experience as part of FND.\nYou may find you have a dragging leg, that you feel unsteady when walking, or that you make excessive movements when walking.\nA specialist will diagnose functional gait disorder based on clinical features, like the way your walking changes when doing different activities.\nRead more about functional gait disorder\nFunctional facial spasm is when there are muscle spasms in the face. These can lead to problems like a narrowing of the eye or the pulling of the mouth or jaw upwards, downwards or to the side.\nRead more about functional facial spasm\nA tic is a fast repetitive movement or sound that happens suddenly. Functional tics can be a symptom of FND.\nFunctional tics can look similar to the tics in Tourette’s syndrome. A specialist will look at the clinical features of your tics to make a diagnosis. It’s quite common to have both functional tics and Tourette’s syndrome.\nA symptom of FND can be jerks or twitches, which is when someone makes sudden movements.\nEveryone experiences random jerks occasionally, like when you jolt awake as you’re falling asleep. In FND, however, these uncontrolled jerks and twitches can become much more frequent.\nRead more about functional jerks and twitches\nFunctional drop attacks are when someone falls to the ground suddenly, without losing consciousness.\nRead more about functional drop attacks\nA symptom of FND can be numbness, pins and needles, or a feeling that a limb isn’t part of your body.\nRead more about functional sensory symptoms\nProblems with your memory or concentration can be a symptom of FND.\nYou might find that you:\n- lose track while doing things, for example being unable to remember why you went into a room\n- go blank, for example when trying to recall your pin number\n- lose track during conversations\n- misplace important things, like your keys or phone\n- forget words\nIt’s normal to experience these things occasionally. For someone with functional cognitive symptoms, these things happen so often that they interfere with work and home life.\nThe cognitive symptoms of FND can sometimes be mistaken for dementia. Specialists will look for features that are typical of functional cognitive symptoms when diagnosing FND.\nRead more about functional cognitive symptoms\nFunctional speech and swallowing difficulties can be a symptom of FND. You might experience:\n- slurred speech\n- a new stutter\n- difficulties finding the right word\n- unintentionally mixing words up\n- whispering or hoarse speech (dysphonia)\n- difficulty swallowing, including feeling like there’s something stuck in your throat\nA specialist will diagnose functional speech and swallowing difficulties based on specific features.\nRead more about functional speech and swallowing difficulties\nPPPD (sometimes called functional dizziness, triple PD or 3PD) can be a symptom of FND.\nThe dizziness in PPPD is typically experienced constantly, and gets worse while walking or in crowded environments.\nThere are many causes of dizziness. Most people with PPPD have another cause of dizziness at the same time. A specialist will diagnose PPPD based on specific features when they assess you.\nRead more about PPPD\nVisual symptoms can be a part of FND. You may experience changes to your vision, like:\n- blurred vision\n- double vision\n- photophobia (sensitivity to light)\n- reduced vision\nA specialist will diagnose functional visual symptoms based on specific features that they find when they examine you.\nRead more about functional visual symptoms\nDissociative symptoms are common in FND, although there are many other causes. These symptoms can be hard to describe, but are often described as feeling:\n- that your body is disconnected from you\n- that your body doesn’t belong to you\n- disconnected from the world around you\n- spaced out\n- that you are floating\n- that you are having an out-of-body experience\n- there but not there\nYou may also be able to hear what’s going on around you, but not be able to respond.\nThese experiences are called dissociation, and can link into other FND symptoms.\nRead more about dissociative symptoms\nThere are other symptoms or conditions that are commonly associated with FND. These include:\n- chronic pain, including fibromyalgia, back and neck pain, and complex regional pain syndrome\n- persistent fatigue\n- sleep problems including insomnia (not sleeping enough) and hypersomnia (sleeping too much)\n- migraines and other types of headache and facial pain\n- irritable bowel syndrome and other problems with the function of your stomach and bowel\n- anxiety and panic attacks\n- depression\n- post-traumatic stress disorder\n- chronic urinary retention despite all tests being normal (which may be diagnosed as Fowlers syndrome)\n- dysfunctional breathing\nWe know that the symptoms of FND happen because there’s a problem with how the brain is sending and receiving messages to itself and other parts of the body. Using research tools, scientists can see that certain circuits in the brain are not working properly in people with FND.\nHowever, there’s still a lot of research to be done to understand how and why FND happens.\nFND can happen for a wide range of reasons. There’s often more than one reason, and the reasons can vary hugely from person to person.\nSome of the reasons why the brain stops working properly in FND include:\n- the brain trying to get rid of a painful sensation\n- a migraine or other neurological symptom\n- the brain shutting down a part or all of the body in response to a situation it thinks is threatening\nIn some people, stressful events in the past or present can be relevant to FND. In others, stress is not relevant.\nThe risk of developing FND increases if you have another neurological condition.\nRead more about how and why FND happens.\nWhen diagnosing FND, your healthcare provider will carry out an assessment to see if there are typical clinical features of FND.\nYour healthcare provider may still choose to test for other diseases and conditions before diagnosing FND. This is because many conditions share the same symptoms and, in around a quarter of cases, FND is present alongside another neurological condition. Someone can have both FND and conditions like sciatica, carpal tunnel syndrome, epilepsy, or multiple sclerosis (MS).\nThe diagnosis of FND, however, should be given because you have the clinical features of FND. It shouldn’t be given just because there’s no evidence of other conditions or illnesses.\nBecause the symptoms of FND are not always there, your healthcare provider may ask you to video your symptoms. This will allow them to see what your symptoms look like.\nFND is a really variable condition. Some people have quite short-lived symptoms. Others can have them for many years.\nThere are treatments available that can manage and improve FND. These treatments are all forms of rehabilitation therapy, which aims to improve your ability to carry out every day activities. Many of these treatments are designed to &#8216;retrain the brain&#8217;. Some people with FND benefit a lot from treatment and may go into remission. Other people continue to have FND symptoms despite treatment.\nSpecialised physiotherapy can be useful in treating FND. It helps to remind the body how it should move. It can also help you build up strength and stamina you may have lost.\nRead more about physiotherapy for FND\nOccupational therapy can be helpful in treating FND. An occupational therapist will work with you to plan your treatment goals, and gradually build your confidence and ability to reach them.\nRead more about occupational therapy for FND\nPsychological therapy can be helpful to many people with FND, even those without stress in their lives. It can help you gain a better understanding of FND and its relationship to your personal circumstances.\nThere are specific psychological techniques which can help you gain better control over movement or seizure symptoms. Psychological therapy can also help you learn to manage low mood, anxiety and past traumatic events, as well as other psychological problems (if present).\nNot everyone with FND will need psychological therapy.\nRead more about psychological therapy for FND\nSpeech and language therapists are available to help if you’re struggling with speaking or swallowing. They have a range of techniques to try, designed to help with specific problems. These might include helping you to shape certain sounds, or to practice breathing patterns as you try to talk.\nRead more about speech and language therapy for FND\nMedication can play a role in treating the some of the problems associated with FND, like pain, depression and anxiety. Your healthcare provider can help decide if medication is right for you.\nThere are many types of medication that can make FND worse, including opiates like morphine, dihydrocodeine or codeine. It may be worth discussing your current medications with your healthcare provider.\nDo not stop taking any medicine that&rsquo;s been prescribed without checking with your GP or healthcare provider first. You could make yourself very ill.\nRead more about treating FND\nFND is broadly the same condition in children and young people. It&#8217;s unusual for it to occur under the age of 10. It becomes more common through the teenage years.\nThe treatment for FND in children and young people is similar to adults. It&#8217;s especially important for families and schools to learn about the condition, so they can respond in the most helpful way.\nIf you&#8217;ve been diagnosed with FND there are sources of information, charities and support groups that can help you.\nThe Neurosymptoms FND Guide has more detailed information. There&#8217;s also an app available with further details about the condition.\nMy FND is an app that allows you to learn about your symptoms. It helps you track them, and offers advice for managing them.\nFND Hope UK is a charity that raises awareness of FND.

        "disease": "Fungal nail infection",
        "description": "Many people develop a fungal nail infection at some point in their life. It&#8217;s not usually serious, but can be unpleasant and difficult to treat.\nThe infection develops slowly and causes the nail to become discoloured, thickened and distorted.\nToenails are more frequently affected than the fingernails.\nThe medical name for a fungal nail infection is onychomycosis.\nA fungal nail infection may not cause any obvious symptoms at first.\nAs it progresses, the infection can cause:\n- discolouration of the nail – it may turn white, black, yellow or green\n- thickening and distortion of the nail – it may become an unusual shape or texture and be difficult to trim\n- pain or discomfort – particularly when using or placing pressure on the affected toe or finger\n- brittle or crumbly nails – pieces may break off and come away completely\nSometimes the skin nearby may also become:\n- infected\n- itchy\n- cracked\n- red\n- swollen\nMost fungal nail infections occur as a result of the fungi that cause athlete&#8217;s foot infecting the nails.\nThese fungi often live harmlessly on your skin, but they can sometimes multiply and lead to infections. The fungi prefer warm, dark and moist places like the feet.\nYou&#8217;re more likely to get a fungal nail infection if you:\n- don&#8217;t keep your feet clean and dry\n- wear shoes that cause your feet to get hot and sweaty\n- walk around barefoot in places where fungal infections can spread easily, like communal showers, locker rooms and gyms\n- have damaged your nails\n- have a weakened immune system\n- have certain other health conditions, like diabetes, psoriasis or peripheral arterial disease\nFungal nail infections can be spread to other people, so you should take steps to avoid this if you have an infection.\nA fungal nail infection is unlikely to get better without treatment. However, if you&#8217;re not bothered by it you might decide it&#8217;s not worth treating because treatment:\n- can take a long time\n- can cause side effects\n- isn&#8217;t always effective\nTreatment may also be unnecessary in mild cases of fungal nail infection. It&#8217;s also unlikely to cause any further problems so you may feel it&#8217;s not worth treating.\nFor more severe or troublesome fungal nail infections, antifungal medication may be recommended.\nAntifungal medication comes in tablets or a special paint you apply directly to the nail.\nA small sample of the infected nail may need to be taken and sent off for testing before treatment starts, to confirm that you do have a fungal infection.\nIf the treatment is working, you should see a new healthy nail start to grow from the base of nail over the course of a few months. The old infected nail should begin to grow out and can be gradually clipped away.\nAntifungal treatments are thought to be effective in treating about 60 to 80% of fungal nail infections. It can take between 6 and 18 months for the appearance of the affected nail to return to normal, and in some cases the nail may not look the same as before the infection.\nTerbinafine and itraconazole are the 2 medicines most commonly prescribed for fungal nail infections.\nThese usually need to be taken once or twice a day for several months to ensure the infection has completely cleared up. If you stop taking the medication too early, the infection may return.\nPossible side effects of antifungal tablets can include:\n- headache\n- itching\n- diarrhoea\n- loss of sense of taste\n- a rash\nAntifungal tablets are currently not licensed to be sold over the counter. This is because these tablets have many listed side effects, contraindications and need to be taken for several months.\nIf you prefer not to take antifungal tablets, your GP or pharmacist may suggest you try antifungal nail paint instead.\nNail paint isn&#8217;t generally considered to be as effective as tablets because it can be difficult for it to reach the deeper layers of the nail. However, it doesn&#8217;t usually cause any side effects.\nLike antifungal tablets, antifungal nail paint also normally needs to be used for several months to ensure that the infection has cleared up.\nSpeak to your GP if new, healthy nail doesn&#8217;t start to grow after a few weeks of treatment.\nKeep using the treatment until your GP says you can stop. Stopping too early could result in the infection returning.\nAs it can take a long time for antifungal medication to work, some people may prefer to use a treatment that involves softening and removing infected parts of nail over a few weeks.\nTreatment kits are available from pharmacies that contain a 40% urea paste, plasters and a scraping device. The paste softens the infected parts of the nail, allowing them to be scraped away so they can be gradually replaced with healthy nail.\nTo use the treatment:\n- wash the affected area and dry it thoroughly\n- carefully apply the paste to the infected nails\n- cover the nails with plasters and leave them for 24 hours\n- wash the paste off the next day and scrape away the softened parts of the nail\n- repeat this process each day for 2 to 3 weeks\nOnce no more infected parts of the nail can be removed, ask your pharmacist for antifungal nail paint to prevent re-infection as the nail regrows over the next few months.\nA procedure to remove affected nails completely isn&#8217;t usually necessary, but may be recommended if the infection is severe or painful and other treatments haven&#8217;t helped.\nIf your nail is surgically removed, a new nail should eventually grow back in its place. However, it could take a year or more for the nail to grow back completely.\nLaser treatment is a possible option if you have a fungal nail infection that&#8217;s particularly stubborn. The laser emits high doses of light energy, which are used to destroy the fungus.\nEarly research suggests the treatment may be helpful in treating fungal nail infections, but there&#8217;s currently not enough evidence to recommend it as a routine treatment.\nIf you want to try laser treatment, you&#8217;ll have to pay for it privately because it&#8217;s not available on the NHS. Be aware that the treatment may need to be repeated several times for up to a year, so it could get very expensive.\nWhether or not you decide to have treatment, you should still follow self-help advice to help stop the condition getting worse or spreading to others."

        "disease": "Gallbladder cancer",
        "description": "Gallbladder cancer is very rare.&nbsp;\nThere are a number of different types of gallbladder cancer,&nbsp;depending on the cells affected.\nOver 85% of gallbladder cancers are adenocarcinoma, which means the&nbsp;cancer&nbsp;started in the gland cells lining the gallbladder.\nCancer that starts in the skin-like cells that line the gallbladder is known as squamous cell cancer.\nThe Cancer Research UK website has more information about the different types of gallbladder cancer.\nCancer of the gallbladder is more common in women than men, with around 7 out of 10 cases diagnosed in women. It’s also more common in older people, particularly those over 70 years of age.\nThe gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ that’s located underneath the liver. It’s main purpose is to store and concentrate bile.\nBile is a liquid produced by the liver that helps to digest fats. It passes from the liver through a series of channels (bile ducts) into the gallbladder, where it’s stored.\nOver time, bile becomes more concentrated, which makes it better at digesting fats. The gallbladder releases bile into the digestive system when it’s needed.\nThe gallbladder is a useful but not essential organ, which can be safely removed without interfering with your ability to digest food.\nIn the early stages, gallbladder cancer doesn’t cause symptoms, which&nbsp;means it could be at an advanced stage by the time it’s diagnosed.\nSymptoms that occur at a later stage can include:\n- abdominal (stomach) pain\n- feeling sick\n- jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes)\nThese symptoms could be linked to&nbsp;a number of conditions and may not be related to gallbladder cancer. However,&nbsp;if you have these symptoms, you should speak to your GP so they can investigate what’s causing them.\nOther possible symptoms of gallbladder cancer can include loss of appetite, unexplained weight loss&nbsp;and a swollen stomach.\nIn gallbladder cancer, abnormal cells grow within the gallbladder. It’s not known why this happens, but certain things are thought to increase your chances of developing the condition.\nGallbladder cancer is more common in older people, and your chances of developing it increase with age.\nLifestyle factors – such as&nbsp;obesity, smoking and an unhealthy diet – are believed to increase the risk of gallbladder cancer. However, there’s not enough evidence to show a firm link between diet and gallbladder cancer.\nThere are also a number of conditions that can increase your chances of developing gallbladder cancer. For example,&nbsp;gallstones,&nbsp;cholecystitis&nbsp;(inflammation of the gallbladder) and&nbsp;diabetes&nbsp;have been closely linked to the condition.\nIf you have a family history of gallstones, cholecystitis, or gallbladder cancer, you’re more likely to develop these conditions yourself.\nThe Cancer Research UK website has more information about the risks and causes of gallbladder cancer.\nYour GP will examine you and ask about your symptoms. If they suspect gallbladder cancer, they may refer you to a specialist, usually a gastroenterologist (a doctor who specialises in conditions of the digestive system).\nThe&nbsp;specialist will ask about your medical history and check to see whether the lymph glands in your neck and groin are swollen.\nYou may also have some initial tests, including:\n- blood tests\n- an&nbsp;ultrasound scan\n- a&nbsp;computerised tomography (CT) scan\nIf these tests reveal anything abnormal in or around your gallbladder, further tests may be arranged&nbsp;to help&nbsp;confirm whether you have gallbladder cancer. These may&nbsp;include:\n- an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)\n- a magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)\n- biopsy&nbsp;and fine needle aspiration (FNA)\nThe Cancer Research UK website has more information about tests for gallbladder cancer.\nThe main treatment for gallbladder cancer is surgery to remove the gallbladder and possibly some of the surrounding tissue.\nChemotherapy&nbsp;and&nbsp;radiotherapy&nbsp;are also sometimes used, either on their own or in combination with surgery.\nThe treatment programme that’s most suitable for you will depend on:\n- the type of gallbladder cancer you have\n- the stage of your cancer\n- your overall level of health\nAs with all cancers, the chances of survival depend on how far the condition has advanced when it is diagnosed.\nThe Cancer Research UK website has more information about treating gallbladder cancer and the stages and outlook for gallbladder cancer."

        "description": "Gallstones are small stones, usually made of cholesterol, that form in the gallbladder. In most cases they don&#8217;t cause any symptoms and don&#8217;t need to be treated.\nHowever, if a gallstone becomes trapped in a duct (opening) inside the gallbladder it can trigger a sudden intense abdominal pain that usually lasts between 1&nbsp;and 5&nbsp;hours. This type of abdominal pain is known as biliary colic.\nSome people with gallstones can also develop complications, such as inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis), which can cause:\n- persistent pain\n- jaundice&nbsp;\n- a fever\nWhen gallstones cause symptoms or complications, it&#8217;s known as gallstone disease or cholelithiasis. Read more about:\n- symptoms of gallstones\n- complications of gallstones\nThe gallbladder is a small, pouch-like organ found underneath the liver.

The gallbladder releases bile into the digestive system when it&#8217;s needed.\nGallstones are thought to develop because of an imbalance in the chemical make-up of bile inside the gallbladder. In most cases the levels of cholesterol in bile become too high and the excess cholesterol forms into stones.\nGallstones are very common. It&#8217;s estimated that more than 1&nbsp;in every 10 adults in the UK&nbsp;has gallstones, although only&nbsp;a minority&nbsp;of&nbsp;people develop symptoms.\nYou&#8217;re more at risk of developing gallstones if you&#8217;re:\n- overweight&nbsp;or obese&nbsp;\n- female, particularly if you&#8217;ve had children\n- 40 or over (the risk increases as you get older)\nRead more about:\n- causes of gallstones&nbsp;\n- preventing gallstones\nTreatment is usually only necessary if gallstones are causing:\n- symptoms –&nbsp;such as abdominal pain\n- complications – such as jaundice or acute pancreatitis\nIn these cases, keyhole surgery to remove the gallbladder may be recommended.&nbsp;This procedure,&nbsp;known as a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, is relatively simple&nbsp;to perform and has a low risk of complications.\nYou can lead a perfectly normal life without a gallbladder. Your liver will still produce bile to digest food, but&nbsp;the bile will just drip continuously into the small intestine, rather than&nbsp;build up in the gallbladder.\nRead more about:\n- treating gallstones\n- diagnosing gallstones\nMost cases of gallstone disease are easily treated with surgery.&nbsp;Very severe cases can be life-threatening, especially in people who are already in poor health. However, deaths from gallstone disease&nbsp;are rare in the UK.\nMost cases of gallstones don&#8217;t cause any symptoms. But if a gallstone blocks one of the bile ducts, it can cause sudden, severe abdominal pain, known as biliary colic.\nOther symptoms may develop&nbsp;if the blockage is more severe or&nbsp;develops in another part of the digestive system.\nGallstones&nbsp;can cause&nbsp;sudden, severe abdominal pain that usually lasts 1&nbsp;to 5&nbsp;hours&nbsp;(although it can sometimes last just a few minutes).\nThe pain can be felt:\n- in the centre of your abdomen (tummy)\n- just under the ribs on your right-hand side –&nbsp;it may spread from here&nbsp;to your side or shoulder blade\nThe pain is constant and isn&#8217;t relieved when you go to the toilet, pass wind or are sick.&nbsp;It&#8217;s sometimes triggered by eating fatty foods, but&nbsp;may occur at any time of day&nbsp;and it may wake you up during the night.\nBiliary colic doesn&#8217;t happen often. After an episode of pain, it may be several weeks or months before you experience another episode.\nSome people also have periods where they sweat excessively and feel sick or vomit.\nWhen&nbsp;gallstones cause episodes of biliary colic, it is known as &#8216;uncomplicated gallstone disease&#8217;.\nIn a small number of people, gallstones can cause more serious problems if they obstruct the flow of bile for longer periods or move into other organs (such as the pancreas or small bowel).\nIf this happens,&nbsp;you&nbsp;may develop:\n- a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above\n- more persistent pain\n- a rapid heartbeat\n- yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)\n- itchy skin\n- diarrhoea\n- chills or shivering attacks\n- confusion\n- a loss of appetite\nDoctors refer to this more severe condition as &#8216;complicated gallstone disease&#8217;.\nRead more about the complications of gallstones.\nIf you think you may be experiencing biliary colic, you should make an appointment with your GP.\nContact your GP immediately for advice if you develop:\n- jaundice\n- abdominal pain lasting longer than eight hours\n- a high temperature and chills\n- abdominal pain so intense that you can&#8217;t find a position to relieve it\nIf it&#8217;s not possible to contact your GP immediately, phone your local out-of-hours or NHS 24&#8217;s 111 service.\nGallstones are thought to be caused by an imbalance in the chemical make-up of bile inside the gallbladder. Bile is a liquid produced by the liver to aid digestion.\nIt&#8217;s still unclear exactly what leads to this imbalance, but gallstones can form if:\n- there are unusually high levels of cholesterol inside the gallbladder (about 4&nbsp;in every 5&nbsp;gallstones are made up of cholesterol)\n- there are unusually high levels of a waste product called bilirubin inside the gallbladder (about 1&nbsp;in every 5&nbsp;gallstones is made up of bilirubin)\nThese chemical imbalances cause tiny crystals to develop in the bile. These can gradually grow (often over many years) into solid stones that can be as small as a grain of sand or as large as a pebble.\nSometimes only 1&nbsp;stone will form, but there are often several at the same time.\nGallstones are more common if you:\n- are female, particularly if you&#8217;ve had children,&nbsp;are taking the combined Pill, or are undergoing high-dose&nbsp;oestrogen therapy\n- are overweight or&nbsp;obese\n- are aged 40 years or older (the older you are, the more likely you are to develop gallstones)\n- have a condition that affects the flow of bile – such as cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), primary sclerosing cholangitis, or&nbsp;obstetric cholestasis&nbsp;\n- have Crohn&#8217;s disease or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\n- have a close family member who&#8217;s also had gallstones\n- have recently lost weight (from either&nbsp;dieting or weight-loss surgery)\n- are taking an antibiotic called ceftriaxone\nGallstones may be discovered during tests for a different condition, as they often don&#8217;t cause any symptoms.\nIf you do have symptoms of gallstones,&nbsp;make an appointment with your GP so they can try to identify the problem.\nYour GP will ask about your symptoms in detail and may&nbsp;carry out the Murphy&#8217;s sign test to help determine if your gallbladder is inflamed.\nDuring this test, your&nbsp;GP places their hand or fingers on the upper-right area of your tummy and asks you to breathe in. If you find this painful, it usually&nbsp;means your gallbladder is inflamed and you may need urgent treatment.\nYour GP may also recommend having&nbsp;blood tests to look for signs of infection, or to check if your liver is working normally.&nbsp;If gallstones have moved into your bile duct, the liver may not be able to&nbsp;function properly.\nIf your symptoms and test results suggest you may have gallstones, you&#8217;ll usually be referred for further tests. You may be admitted to hospital for tests the same day if your symptoms suggest you have a more severe form of gallbladder disease.\nGallstones can usually be confirmed using an ultrasound scan, which uses high frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of the body.\nThe type of ultrasound scan used for gallstones&nbsp;is similar to the scan used during pregnancy, where a small handheld device called a transducer is placed onto your skin and moved over your upper abdomen.\nSound waves are sent from the transducer, through your skin and into your body. They bounce back off the body tissues, forming an image on a monitor. This is a painless procedure that usually takes about 10 to 15 minutes to complete.\nWhen gallstones are diagnosed, there may be some uncertainty about whether any stones have passed into the bile duct.\nGallstones in the bile duct are sometimes seen during an ultrasound scan.&nbsp;If they&#8217;re not visible but your&nbsp;tests&nbsp;suggest the bile duct may be affected, you may need an MRI scan or a cholangiography.\nA magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan may be carried out to look for gallstones in the bile ducts. This type of scan uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of the inside of the body.\nA procedure called a cholangiography can give further information about the condition of your gallbladder.\nA cholangiography uses a dye that shows up on X-rays. The dye&nbsp;may be injected into your bloodstream or injected directly into your bile ducts during surgery or using an&nbsp;endoscope&nbsp;passed through your mouth.\nAfter the dye has been introduced, X-ray images are taken. They&#8217;ll reveal any abnormality in your bile or pancreatic systems. If your gallbladder and bile systems are working normally, the dye will be absorbed in the places it&#8217;s meant to go (your liver, bile ducts, intestines and gallbladder).\nIf a blockage is detected during this test, your doctor may try to remove&nbsp;it at this point using an endoscope. This is known as&nbsp;an endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP). See&nbsp;treating gallstones for more information about ERCP.\nA computerised tomography (CT) scan may be carried out to look for any complications of gallstones, such as acute pancreatitis. This type of scan involves taking a series of X-rays from many different angles.\nCT scans are&nbsp;often done&nbsp;in an emergency to diagnose severe abdominal pain.\nYour treatment plan for gallstones depends on how the symptoms are affecting your daily life.\nIf you don&#8217;t have any symptoms, a policy of &#8216;active monitoring&#8217; is often recommended. This means you won&#8217;t receive immediate treatment, but you should let your GP know if you notice any symptoms.\nAs a general rule, the longer you go without symptoms, the less likely it is that your condition will get worse.\nYou may need treatment if you have a condition that increases your risk of&nbsp;developing complications, such as:\n- scarring of the liver (cirrhosis)\n- high blood pressure inside the liver – this is known as portal hypertension and is often a complication of&nbsp;alcohol-related liver disease\n- diabetes\nTreatment may also be recommended if a scan shows high levels of calcium inside your gallbladder, as this can lead to&nbsp;gallbladder cancer in later life.\nIf you have episodes of abdominal pain (biliary colic), treatment depends on how the pain affects your daily activities. If&nbsp;the episodes are&nbsp;mild and infrequent, you may be prescribed painkillers to control further episodes and given advice about&nbsp;eating a healthy diet to help control the pain.\nIf your symptoms are more severe and occur frequently,&nbsp;surgery to remove the gallbladder&nbsp;is usually recommended.\nThe gallbladder isn&#8217;t an essential organ and&nbsp;you can lead a perfectly normal life without one.&nbsp;Some people may experience symptoms of bloating and diarrhoea after eating fatty or spicy food. If certain foods do trigger symptoms, you may wish to avoid them in the future.\nIf surgery is recommended, you&#8217;ll usually have keyhole surgery to remove your gallbladder. This is known as a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\nDuring a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 3 or 4 small cuts are made in your abdomen. One larger cut (about 2cm to 3cm) will be by the belly button and the others (each 1cm or less) will be on the right side of your abdomen.\nYour abdomen is temporarily inflated using carbon dioxide gas. This is harmless and makes it easier for the surgeon to see your organs.\nA&nbsp;laparoscope (long thin telescope with a tiny light and video camera at the end) is inserted through one of the cuts in your abdomen. This allows your surgeon to view the operation on a video monitor.&nbsp;Your surgeon will then remove your gallbladder using special surgical instruments.\nIf it&#8217;s thought there may be gallstones in the bile duct, an X-ray or ultrasound scan of the bile duct is also taken during the operation. If gallstones are found, they may be removed during keyhole surgery. If the operation can&#8217;t be done this way or an unexpected complication occurs, it may have to be converted to open surgery.\nAfter the gallbladder has been removed, the gas in your abdomen escapes through the laparoscope and the cuts are closed with dissolvable stitches and covered with dressings.\nLaparoscopic cholecystectomies are usually performed under a general anaesthetic, which means you&#8217;ll be asleep during the procedure and won&#8217;t feel any pain while it&#8217;s carried out. The operation takes 60 to 90 minutes and you can usually go home the same day. Full recovery typically takes around 10 days.\nSingle-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a newer type of keyhole surgery used to remove the gallbladder. During this type of surgery, only one small cut is made, which means you&#8217;ll only have one&nbsp;barely visible scar.\nHowever, single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomies haven’t been carried out as often as conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomies, so there are still some uncertainties about it. Access to this type of surgery is also limited because it needs an experienced surgeon with specialist training.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has more information on&nbsp;single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\nA&nbsp;laparoscopic cholecystectomy may not always be recommended, for example if you:\n- are in the third trimester (the last three months) of pregnancy\n- are extremely overweight\n- have an unusual gallbladder or bile duct structure that makes a&nbsp;keyhole procedure difficult and potentially dangerous\nIn these circumstances, an open cholecystectomy may be recommended. During this procedure, a 10cm to 15cm (4in to 6in) incision is made in your abdomen underneath the ribs so the gallbladder can be removed. This is done under general anaesthetic, so you&#8217;ll be asleep and won&#8217;t feel any pain.\nOpen surgery is just as effective as laparoscopic surgery, but it does have a longer recovery time and causes more visible scarring. Most people have to stay in hospital for up to 5&nbsp;days and it typically takes 6&nbsp;weeks to fully recover.\nAn endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) is a procedure that can be used to remove gallstones from the bile duct. The gallbladder isn&#8217;t removed during this procedure, so any stones in the gallbladder will remain unless removed using the surgical techniques mentioned above.\nERCP is similar to a diagnostic cholangiography (see diagnosing gallstones for more information), where an endoscope (long, thin flexible tube with a camera at the end) is passed through your mouth down to where the bile duct opens into the small intestine.\nHowever, during ERCP the&nbsp;opening of the bile duct&nbsp;is widened with a small incision or an electrically heated wire. The bile duct stones are then removed or left to pass into your intestine and out of your body.\nSometimes a small tube called a stent is permanently placed in the bile duct to help the bile and stones pass.\nAn ERCP is usually carried out under sedation, which means you&#8217;ll be awake throughout the procedure but won&#8217;t experience any pain.\nThe ERCP procedure&nbsp;lasts about 30 minutes on average, but can take from 15 minutes to over an hour.&nbsp;You may need to stay overnight in hospital after the procedure so you can be monitored.\nIf your&nbsp;gallstones are small and don&#8217;t contain calcium, it may be possible to take ursodeoxycholic acid&nbsp;tablets to dissolve them.\nHowever, these aren&#8217;t&nbsp;prescribed very often because:\n- they&#8217;re&nbsp;rarely very effective\n- they need to be taken for a long time (up to 2&nbsp;years)\n- gallstones can recur once treatment is stopped\nSide effects of ursodeoxycholic acid are uncommon and are usually mild. The most commonly reported side effects are feeling sick, being sick and itchy skin.\nThe use of ursodeoxycholic acid isn&#8217;t usually recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women. Sexually active women should use either a barrier method of contraception, such as a condom, or a low-dose oestrogen contraceptive pill while taking ursodeoxycholic acid, as it may affect other types of oral contraceptive pills.\nUrsodeoxycholic acid tablets are occasionally also prescribed as a precaution against gallstones if it&#8217;s thought you&#8217;re at risk of developing them. For example, you may be prescribed ursodeoxycholic acid if you&#8217;ve recently had weight loss surgery, as rapid weight loss can cause gallstones to grow.\nA small number of people with gallstones may develop serious problems if the gallstones cause a severe blockage or move into another part of the digestive system.\nIn some cases of gallstone disease a bile duct can become permanently blocked, which can lead to a build-up of bile inside the gallbladder. This can cause the gallbladder to become infected and inflamed.\nThe medical term for inflammation of the gallbladder is acute cholecystitis. Symptoms include:\n- pain in your upper abdomen that travels towards your shoulder blade (unlike biliary colic, the pain usually lasts longer than five hours)\n- a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above\n- a rapid heartbeat\nAn estimated 1&nbsp;in 7&nbsp;people with acute cholecystitis also experience jaundice (see below).\nAcute cholecystitis is usually treated first with antibiotics to settle the infection and then keyhole surgery to remove the gallbladder. This operation can be more difficult when performed as an emergency and there&#8217;s a higher risk of it being converted to an open procedure.\nSometimes a&nbsp;severe infection can lead to a gallbladder abscess (empyema of the gallbladder). Antibiotics alone don&#8217;t always treat these and they may need to be drained.\nOccasionally a severely inflamed gallbladder&nbsp;can tear, leading to&nbsp;peritonitis&nbsp;(inflammation of the inside lining of the abdomen).&nbsp;If this happens, you may need to have antibiotics given directly into a vein (intravenous antibiotics) and surgery may be required to remove a section of the lining if part of it becomes severely damaged.\nRead more about acute cholecystitis.\nIf a gallstone passes out of the gallbladder into the bile duct and blocks the flow of bile, jaundice occurs.\nSymptoms of jaundice include:\n- yellowing of the skin and eyes\n- dark brown urine\n- pale stools\n- itching\nSometimes the stone passes from the bile duct on its own. If it doesn&#8217;t, the stone needs to be removed. See treating gallstones.\nIf the bile ducts become blocked, they&#8217;re vulnerable to infection by bacteria. The medical term for a bile duct infection is acute cholangitis.\nSymptoms of acute cholangitis include:\n- pain in your upper abdomen that travels towards your shoulder blade\n- a high temperature\n- jaundice\n- chills\n- confusion\n- itchy skin\n- generally feeling unwell\nAntibiotics will help treat the infection, but it&#8217;s also important to help the bile from the liver to drain with an endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP). Read treating gallstones for more information.\nAcute pancreatitis&nbsp;may develop when a gallstone moves out of the gallbladder and blocks the opening (duct) of the pancreas, causing it to become inflamed.\nThe most common symptom of acute pancreatitis is a sudden severe dull pain in the centre of your upper abdomen, around the top of your stomach.\nThe pain of acute pancreatitis often gets steadily worse until it reaches a constant ache. The ache may travel from your abdomen and along your back and may feel worse after you have eaten. Leaning forward or curling into a ball may help to relieve the pain.\nOther symptoms of acute pancreatitis can include:\n- feeling sick\n- being sick\n- diarrhoea&nbsp;\n- loss of appetite\n- a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above\n- tenderness of the abdomen\n- less commonly, jaundice\nThere&#8217;s currently no cure for acute pancreatitis, so treatment focuses on supporting the functions of the body until the inflammation has passed.\nThis usually involves admission to hospital so you can be given:\n- fluids into a vein (intravenous fluids)\n- pain relief\n- nutritional support\n- oxygen through tubes into your nose\nWith treatment, most people with acute pancreatitis improve within a week and are well enough to leave hospital after 5 to 10 days.\nRead more about acute pancreatitis.\nGallbladder cancer&nbsp;is a rare but serious complication of gallstones. An estimated 660 cases of gallbladder cancer are diagnosed in the UK each year.\nHaving a history of gallstones increases your risk of developing gallbladder cancer.&nbsp;Approximately 4&nbsp;out of every 5&nbsp;people who have cancer of the gallbladder also have a history of gallstones.\nHowever, people with a history of gallstones have a less than one in 10,000 chance of developing gallbladder cancer.\nIf you have additional risk factors, such as a family history of gallbladder cancer or high levels of calcium inside your gallbladder, it may be recommended that your gallbladder be removed as a precaution, even if your gallstones aren&#8217;t causing any symptoms.\nThe symptoms of gallbladder cancer are similar to those of complicated gallstone disease, including:\n- abdominal pain\n- high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above\n- jaundice\nGallbladder cancer can be treated with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.\nAnother rare but serious complication of gallstones is known as gallstone ileus. This is where the bowel becomes obstructed by a gallstone.\nGallstone ileus can occur when an abnormal channel, known as a fistula, opens up near the gallbladder. Gallstones are then able to travel through the fistula and can block the bowel.\nSymptoms of gallstone ileus include:\n- abdominal pain\n- being sick\n- swelling of the abdomen&nbsp;\n- constipation\nA bowel obstruction requires immediate medical treatment. If it&#8217;s not treated, there&#8217;s a risk that the bowel could split open (rupture). This could cause internal bleeding and widespread infection.\nIf you suspect you have an obstructed bowel, contact your GP as soon as possible. If this isn&#8217;t possible, phone the NHS 24 111 service.\nSurgery is usually required to remove the gallstone and unblock the bowel. The type of surgery you receive depends on where in the bowel the obstruction has occurred.\nFrom the limited evidence available, changes to your diet and losing weight (if you&#8217;re overweight) may help prevent gallstones.\nBecause of the role cholesterol appears to play in the formation of gallstones, it is advisable to avoid eating too many foods with a high saturated fat&nbsp;content.\nFoods high in saturated fat include:\n- meat pies\n- sausages and fatty cuts of meat\n- butter, ghee and lard\n- cream\n- hard cheeses&nbsp;\n- cakes and biscuits\n- food containing coconut or palm oil\nA healthy, balanced diet is recommended. This includes plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (at least 5&nbsp;portions a day) and wholegrains.\nThere&#8217;s also evidence that regularly eating nuts, such as peanuts or cashews, can help reduce&nbsp;your risk of developing gallstones.&nbsp;\nDrinking small amounts of alcohol may also&nbsp;help reduce your risk of gallstones. However, you shouldn&#8217;t regularly drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week as this can lead to liver problems and other health conditions. Regularly drinking any amount of alcohol can increase the risk to your health.\nRead more about:&nbsp;\n- high cholesterol\n- how to lower your cholesterol\n- healthy eating\nBeing overweight, particularly being obese, increases the amount of cholesterol in your bile, which increases your risk of developing gallstones. You should control your weight by eating a healthy diet and taking plenty of regular exercise.\nHowever, avoid low-calorie, rapid-weight-loss diets. There&#8217;s evidence they can disrupt your bile chemistry and increase your risk of developing gallstones. A more gradual weight loss plan is recommended.\nRead more about&nbsp;losing weight and getting started with exercise."

Scans are rarely needed but can be helpful if the diagnosis is uncertain.\nA ganglion cyst starts when the fluid from a joint or tendon collects and forms a jelly-filled sac beneath the skin.\nIt&#8217;s not known why this happens but they can be common.\nGanglion cysts can form:\n- at the back of the wrist &#8211; these often disappear without treatment\n- at the front of the wrist\n- at the base of the finger &#8211; these tend to be firmer, and pea-like in shape\n- at the top of the foot\nMost ganglion cysts disappear on their own, without treatment. In the early stages, you should wait to see if this happens.\nPain may be related to the pressure being applied to the ganglion. You could adapt your hand position for activities to see if that helps. It&#8217;s important to use your hand or foot as normally as you can to avoid the area getting stiff or weak.\nYour healthcare professional may consider aspiration of the ganglion cyst, if appropriate.\nIt&#8217;s a procedure where they will remove fluid from the ganglion with a needle and syringe.\nYou may be referred for surgery if the ganglion is causing significant pain or affects function. The surgery may be carried out under either local or general anaesthetic.\nAs with any surgery there are associated risks. Your healthcare professional will discuss these with you.\nAfter any treatment, there&#8217;s a possibility the ganglion may come back."

Ask your pharmacist for advice on treatments.&nbsp;\nVisit your GP if you&#8217;re worried about your symptoms, or if:\n- you have symptoms several times a week\n- over-the-counter medications aren&#8217;t helping\n- your symptoms are severe\n- you have difficulty swallowing\n- you have possible signs of a more serious problem, such as persistent vomiting,&nbsp;vomiting blood or&nbsp;unexplained weight loss\nYour GP will usually be able to diagnose GORD based on your symptoms, although they&nbsp;may refer you&nbsp;for some tests.\nRead more about diagnosing GORD.\nThe main treatments for GORD are:\n- self-help measures – this includes eating smaller but more frequent meals, avoiding any foods or drinks that trigger your symptoms, raising the head of your bed, and keeping to a healthy weight\n- over-the-counter medicines – ask your pharmacist to recommend an&nbsp;antacid&nbsp;or an&nbsp;alginate\n- stronger prescription medicines – including&nbsp;proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs)&nbsp;and H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs)\nYou may only need to take medication when&nbsp;you experience symptoms, although long-term treatment may be needed if the problem continues.\nSurgery to stop stomach acid leaking&nbsp;into your oesophagus may be recommended if medication isn&#8217;t helping, or you don&#8217;t want to take medication on a long-term basis.\nRead more about the treatments for GORD.\nIf you have GORD for a long time, stomach acid can damage your oesophagus and cause further problems.\nThese include:\n- ulcers&nbsp;(sores)&nbsp;on the oesophagus – these&nbsp;may bleed and make swallowing painful\n- the oesophagus becoming scarred and narrowed –&nbsp;this can make swallowing difficult and may require an operation to correct it\n- changes in the cells lining the oesophagus (Barrett&#8217;s oesophagus) – very occasionally, oesophageal cancer&nbsp;can develop from these cells, so you may need to be closely monitored\nRead more about the complications of GORD.\nThe main symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) are heartburn and acid reflux.\nHeartburn is an uncomfortable&nbsp;burning sensation in the chest.\nIt&#8217;s usually felt just below your breastbone, but can spread up to the throat in some people.\nThe&nbsp;discomfort is usually worse after eating, or when bending over or lying down.\nAcid reflux is where acid&nbsp;and other&nbsp;stomach contents are&nbsp;brought back up (regurgitated)&nbsp;into your throat and mouth.\nIt usually causes an unpleasant, sour taste at the back of your mouth.\nIf you have GORD, you may also experience:\n- a sore, inflamed oesophagus (oesophagitis)\n- bad breath\n- bloating and belching\n- feeling or being sick\n- difficulty swallowing, which&nbsp;may feel&nbsp;like a piece of food is stuck low down in your throat\n- pain when swallowing&nbsp;\n- a&nbsp;sore throat&nbsp;and hoarseness\n- a persistent&nbsp;cough&nbsp;or wheezing, which may be worse at night\n- tooth decay and&nbsp;gum disease\nIf you also have&nbsp;asthma, the symptoms may get worse as a result of stomach acid irritating your airways.\nGastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is usually caused by the ring of muscle at the bottom of the oesophagus (gullet) becoming weakened.\nNormally, this ring of muscle&nbsp;opens to let food into your stomach and closes to&nbsp;stop&nbsp;stomach acid leaking back up into your oesophagus.\nBut for people with GORD, stomach acid is able to pass back up into the oesophagus. This causes&nbsp;symptoms of GORD, which can include heartburn and acid reflux.\nIt&#8217;s not always clear what causes this ring of muscle to become weakened, but certain things can increase the risk of it happening.\nThe following factors may&nbsp;increase your risk of developing GORD:\n- being overweight or obese&nbsp;–&nbsp;this can place increased pressure on your stomach and weaken the&nbsp;muscles at the bottom of the oesophagus\n- eating large amounts of fatty foods –&nbsp;the stomach takes longer to&nbsp;get rid&nbsp;of stomach acid after digesting a fatty meal and the resulting excess acid may leak up into the oesophagus\n- smoking, alcohol, coffee or chocolate – these may relax the muscles at the bottom of the oesophagus\n- pregnancy –&nbsp;temporary changes in hormone levels&nbsp;and increased pressure on your stomach during pregnancy can cause GORD\n- hiatus hernia&nbsp;–&nbsp;when part of your stomach pushes up through your diaphragm (thin sheet of muscle between the chest and tummy)\n- gastroparesis&nbsp;– when the stomach takes longer to&nbsp;get rid&nbsp;of stomach acid, which means&nbsp;excess acid can leak up into the oesophagus\n- certain medicines – some medicines can cause GORD or make the symptoms worse, including&nbsp;calcium-channel blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),&nbsp;nitrates (used to treat&nbsp;angina) and&nbsp;non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\n- stress\nGORD can sometimes affect several members of the same family and it&#8217;s been suggested that the genes you inherit from your parents may also affect your chances of&nbsp;developing the condition.\nYour GP will often be able to diagnose&nbsp;gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) based on your symptoms.\nThey may prescribe medication to treat it without needing to carry out any tests. Read more about treating GORD.\nYou&#8217;ll usually only need to be&nbsp;referred for tests in hospital if:\n- your GP is unsure whether you have GORD\n- your symptoms are persistent, severe or unusual\n- prescription medications aren&#8217;t controlling your symptoms\n- your GP thinks you might benefit from surgery\n- you have signs of a potentially more severe condition, such as difficulty swallowing&nbsp;or&nbsp;unexplained weight loss\nTests can help to confirm the diagnosis of GORD, check for other possible causes of your symptoms and determine whether you may be suitable for surgery.\nTests you may have include:\n- an&nbsp;endoscopy\n- a&nbsp;barium swallow or barium meal test\n- manometry\n- 24-hour pH monitoring\n- blood tests\nAn&nbsp;endoscopy is a procedure where the inside of your body is examined using an endoscope, which is a long, thin, flexible tube with&nbsp;a light and camera at one end.\nThe endoscope will be gently inserted into your mouth and down your throat. The procedure is usually carried out while you&#8217;re awake, but you may be given a sedative to help you relax.\nThe camera can show&nbsp;if the surface of your oesophagus (gullet) has been damaged by stomach acid, although this doesn&#8217;t happen to everyone with GORD.\nA barium swallow, or barium meal, is a test to assess your swallowing ability and look for any blockages or abnormalities in your oesophagus.\nYou are first given some barium solution, then some X-rays are taken. Barium is a harmless substance that shows up clearly on X-rays as it passes through your digestive system.\nYou&#8217;ll be asked not to&nbsp;eat anything for a few hours before the procedure. Afterwards, you&#8217;ll be able to eat and drink normally, although you may need to drink more water to help flush the barium out of your body.\nManometry is used to assess how well the ring of muscle at the end of your oesophagus is working, by measuring the pressure in your oesophagus.\nThis can rule out other possible causes of your symptoms and&nbsp;can help determine whether surgery would be suitable.\nDuring the procedure,&nbsp;a small tube will be passed up your nose and then down into your oesophagus. The tube contains pressure sensors that can detect the pressure in the oesophagus.\nIt may be necessary to measure the acidity level (pH) in your oesophagus to confirm a diagnosis of GORD if nothing is found during an endoscopy.\nThe acidity level is measured over 24 hours, using a thin tube containing a sensor that&#8217;s passed up your nose and down your oesophagus. This is usually connected to a recording device worn on your waist.\nYou&#8217;ll be asked to press a button on the recorder every time you become aware of your symptoms and to record your symptoms in a diary. You should eat as you normally would during the test to ensure an accurate result.\nSometimes a&nbsp;blood test may be carried out to check for&nbsp;anaemia, which can be a sign of internal bleeding.&nbsp;\nHeartburn and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) can often be treated with self-help measures and over-the-counter medicines.\nIf these don&#8217;t help, your GP can prescribe stronger medication or refer you to a specialist to discuss whether surgery may be an option.\nYou may find the following measures can help reduce heartburn and other symptoms of GORD:\n- eat smaller and more frequent meals, rather than 3 large meals a day – don&#8217;t eat or drink alcohol within 3 or 4 hours before going to bed, and avoid having your largest meal of the day in the evening\n- avoid anything you think triggers your symptoms – common triggers include coffee, chocolate, tomatoes, alcohol, and fatty or spicy food\n- don&#8217;t wear tight clothing – clothes that are tight around your tummy may make your symptoms worse\n- raise the head of your bed by up to 20cm (8 inches) – placing a piece of wood or blocks underneath one end of your bed may reduce symptoms at night; don&#8217;t just use extra pillows, as this can put a strain on your tummy\n- try to relax – stress can make heartburn and GORD worse, so learning relaxation techniques may help if you&#8217;re often feeling stressed\n- maintain a healthy weight – if you&#8217;re overweight, losing weight may help reduce your symptoms\n- stop smoking – smoke can irritate your digestive system and may make your symptoms worse\nIf you&#8217;re taking medication for other health conditions, check with your GP to find out whether they could be contributing to your symptoms.\nDifferent&nbsp;medicines may be available, but don&#8217;t stop taking any prescribed medication without consulting your GP first.\nA number of different medications can be used to treat symptoms of GORD.\nOver-the-counter heartburn and GORD medicines are available from pharmacies without a prescription. The main types are:\n- antacids&nbsp;– these&nbsp;neutralise the effects of stomach acid\n- alginates –&nbsp;these&nbsp;produce a coating that protects the stomach and oesophagus (gullet) from stomach acid\n- low-dose proton-pump inhibitors and&nbsp;H2-receptor antagonists –&nbsp;see below for more information about these&nbsp;\nThese medicines aren&#8217;t suitable for everyone, so you should check the leaflet first. Ask a pharmacist for advice if you&#8217;re not sure.\nIf your symptoms don&#8217;t get better despite trying self-help measures and over-the-counter medicines, your GP may prescribe a PPI. These work by reducing the amount of acid&nbsp;produced by your stomach.\nYou&#8217;ll usually be given enough medication to last a month. Go back to your GP if they don&#8217;t&nbsp;help or your symptoms return after treatment finishes.&nbsp;Some people need to take&nbsp;PPIs on a long-term basis.\nThe possible side effects of PPIs are usually mild. They include headaches, diarrhoea&nbsp;or&nbsp;constipation, feeling sick, abdominal pain, dizziness&nbsp;and a rash.\nYour GP will prescribe the lowest dose that they think will control your symptoms to reduce the risk of side effects.\nIf PPIs don&#8217;t control your symptoms, a medicine known as a H2RA may be recommended for you to take alongside them on a short-term basis, or as an alternative.\nLike PPIs, H2RAs reduce the amount of acid produced by&nbsp;your stomach.\nSide effects of H2RAs are uncommon, but can&nbsp;include diarrhoea, headaches, dizziness, a&nbsp;rash and tiredness.\nSurgery may be an option if:\n- the above treatments don&#8217;t help,&nbsp;aren&#8217;t suitable for you, or&nbsp;cause troublesome side effects\n- you don&#8217;t want to take medication on a long-term basis\nThe main procedure used is called&nbsp;a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF).&nbsp;Alternative&nbsp;techniques have been developed more recently,&nbsp;although these aren&#8217;t yet widely available.\nLNF is a type of laparoscopic or &#8216;keyhole&#8217; surgery. This means it&#8217;s carried out using special surgical instruments inserted through small cuts (incisions) in the skin.\nThe procedure is used to tighten the ring of muscle at the bottom of the oesophagus,&nbsp;which helps to stop acid leaking up from the stomach. It&#8217;s carried out in hospital under general anaesthetic.\nMost people need to stay in hospital for 2&nbsp;or 3&nbsp;days after the procedure. Depending on your job, you may be able to return to work within 3&nbsp;to 6&nbsp;weeks.\nFor the first 6&nbsp;weeks after surgery, you should only eat soft food, such as mince, mashed potatoes or soup. Some people experience problems with swallowing, belching and bloating after LNF,&nbsp;but these should get better with time.\nIn the last few years, several new techniques for treating GORD have been developed.\nThe&nbsp;National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says these procedures appear to be safe, but&nbsp;not much&nbsp;is known about their long-term effects.\nThese techniques include:\n- Endoscopic injection of bulking agents&nbsp;–&nbsp;where special filler is injected into the area between the stomach and oesophagus to make&nbsp;it narrower.\n- Endoluminal gastroplication&nbsp;–&nbsp;where folds are sown into the ring of muscles at the bottom of the oesophagus to restrict how far it can open.\n- Endoscopic augmentation with hydrogel implants&nbsp;–&nbsp;where implants containing&nbsp;special&nbsp;gel&nbsp;are placed&nbsp;into the area between the stomach and oesophagus to make it narrower.\n- Endoscopic radiofrequency ablation&nbsp;–&nbsp;where a tiny balloon is passed down to the bottom of&nbsp;the oesophagus and electrodes attached to it are used to heat it and make it narrower.\n- Laparoscopic insertion of a magnetic bead band (LINX)&nbsp;–&nbsp;where a ring of magnetic beads are implanted around the lower part of the oesophagus to strengthen it and help keep it closed when not swallowing.\nSpeak to your surgeon about these techniques for more information.\nA number of possible complications can occur as a result of having gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) for a long time.\nThe&nbsp;stomach acid that leaks into the oesophagus in people with GORD can damage the lining of&nbsp;the oesophagus (oesophagitis), which can cause ulcers to form.\nThese ulcers can bleed, causing pain and making it difficult to swallow.\nMedications used to treat GORD, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), can help ulcers heal by reducing the amount of acid that leaks into the oesophagus. Read more about treatments for GORD.\nRepeated damage to the oesophagus by stomach acid can also cause it to become scarred and narrowed.\nThis is known as oesophageal stricture and it&nbsp;can make swallowing difficult and painful.\nIf this happens,&nbsp;a procedure to widen the oesophagus using a small balloon or other widening device may be recommended.\nRepeated episodes of GORD can sometimes lead to changes in the cells in the&nbsp;lining of your lower oesophagus. This is known as Barrett&#8217;s oesophagus.\nIt&#8217;s estimated that about 1 in every 10 people with GORD will develop Barrett&#8217;s oesophagus, usually&nbsp;after many years.\nBarrett&#8217;s oesophagus doesn&#8217;t usually cause noticeable symptoms other than those caused by GORD.\nHowever, there&#8217;s a small risk that the changed cells could become cancerous in the future (see below). Your doctor may suggest having an endoscopy&nbsp;every few years to check for this.\nIt&#8217;s estimated that 1 in every 10 to 20 people with Barrett&#8217;s oesophagus will develop oesophageal cancer within 10 to 20 years.\nSymptoms of oesophageal cancer include:\n- difficulty swallowing\n- unexplained weight loss\n- persistent&nbsp;indigestion\n- hoarseness\n- a persistent&nbsp;cough and/or&nbsp;coughing blood\n- vomiting\nSpeak to your doctor&nbsp;if you experience any swallowing difficulties, or any other unusual or persistent symptoms.\nSurgery to remove the cancer can be carried out if it&#8217;s&nbsp;diagnosed at an early stage.\nRead more about&nbsp;treatments for oesophageal cancer."

        "disease": "Genital herpes",
        "description": "Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by a virus called herpes simplex virus (HSV).\nThere are 2 different types of the virus. Both of which affect the genitals.\nGenital herpes causes painful blisters and sores on and around the genitals. It can also sometimes cause problems if you have it for the first time during pregnancy.\nMost people with the herpes virus don&#8217;t notice any symptoms and don&#8217;t know they have it. So it&#8217;s important to get tested if you think you&#8217;re infected.\nIf you do get symptoms, it takes usually 2 to 12 days after contact for them to appear. Some people don&#8217;t get symptoms until months or sometimes years later.\nOnce you have the herpes infection, the virus stays in your body. It can lie dormant for long periods but can reactivate in the area that was originally infected. If this happens, the sores and blisters can reappear. This is known as a ‘recurrent episode’ of genital herpes.\nThis first episode of genital herpes may last from 2 to 4 weeks.\nRepeated episodes are not usually as severe, or long, as the first and you may never have a repeat episode.\nSymptoms of the first infection include:\n- spots or red bumps around the genital area\n- pain inside the vagina, head of penis or anus\n- vaginal discharge\n- pain peeing or being unable to pee\n- fever\n- flu-like symptoms, backache, headache and a temperature\n- mild swelling of the lymph glands in the groin, armpits and neck\nIf you have a recurrent infection, your symptoms may include:\n- a tingling or burning sensation before blisters appear\n- painful red blisters, which soon burst to leave ulcers\n- pain inside the vagina, head of penis or anus\nIf you think you might have genital herpes, get tested for free by:\n- contacting your GP practice for an appointment\n- booking an appointment at your local sexual health service\nYour doctor or nurse may be able to diagnose by looking at symptoms such as blisters, sores and ulcers.\nIf you have visible blisters, your doctor or nurse may take a swab for testing. This is to check if it&#8217;s herpes and what type. The swab can also test for another STI which causes blisters called syphilis.\nThe genital herpes swab tests are very reliable, though if the ulcer is too dry then it may be less likely to find a positive result.\nGenital herpes can be treated with antiviral medication.\nThe symptoms of genital herpes can be treated, although it could keep coming back.\nSymptoms of recurrent genital herpes will usually clear up without any treatment.\nSome people experience recurrences of genital herpes. In these cases, a longer course of tablets should stop any recurrent episodes.\nYou can talk to your GP or nurse about which treatment options are right for you.\nAs there&#8217;s no screening test for herpes, partners should only have a test if they also have symptoms.\nYou can get genital herpes:\n- from skin to skin contact with the infected area (including vaginal, anal and oral sex)\n- when there are no visible sores or blisters\n- if a cold sore touches your genitals or face\n- kissing (if the person has a cold sore on their face)\n- by sharing sex toys with someone who has herpes\nSometimes herpes can be passed on when your sexual partner has no visible sores or symptoms. This is because the virus can become active on the skin without causing any visible blisters or sores. This is sometimes called ‘asymptomatic shedding’.\nThis risk goes down during the first months after you catch herpes and is not likely after two years. However, it is more common when people are still having frequent recurrences.\nVery rarely, herpes is passed to a newborn baby during childbirth. This is only likely to happen if a mother has her first episode of herpes after week 26 of the pregnancy. When women have had herpes longer than three months, normal delivery is expected even if there are symptoms at the time of delivery.\nThe best way to reduce your risk of STIs is to practice safer sex. This means using a condom for vaginal, anal and oral sex.\nIf your partner has herpes, avoiding sex when they have visible sores reduces your risk of getting herpes.\nIf you’ve been diagnosed with herpes it’s recommended that you are tested for all STIs including:\n- chlamydia\n- gonorrhoea\n- syphilis\n- HIV\nThis is even more important if you have recurrent episodes."

        "description": "Not all symptoms that you may experience around your genitals are caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI).\nSymptoms can be caused by a variety of natural changes in your body as well as infections that are not sexually transmitted.\nBecome very ill and have:\nSingle ulcers (sores) could be a sign of a recent infection of&nbsp;syphilis, especially if there is no pain.\nPainful ulcers may be due to herpes, other infections or recent trauma. It can help to take a photo of your ulcer so you can show the sexual health clinician at your appointment.\nIf you think you have&nbsp;mpox (monkeypox)&nbsp;or you&#8217;ve come into contact in the last 21 days with someone who has mpox, you should phone your local service before you attend in person.\nThere are many causes of pain in the lower tummy. For example issues of the bowel or urinary tract and many gynaecological conditions.\nSome STIs such as&nbsp;gonorrhoea, or&nbsp;chlamydia, can very occasionally spread up into the womb and cause pelvic pain and/or deep pain during sex.\nIf you have pain like this and think you have been at risk of an STI then you should&nbsp;contact your local service.\nIf there is any possibility that you could be pregnant, take a pregnancy test.\nWhether you have discomfort peeing or not, discharge from the end of the penis could mean that you have an STI such as&nbsp;chlamydia&nbsp;or&nbsp;gonorrhoea.&nbsp;Book a consultation online&nbsp;or contact your local&nbsp;sexual health service&nbsp;for advice.\nGonorrhoea&nbsp;and&nbsp;chlamydia&nbsp;usually affect just the urinary tract. But sometimes infection can spread to the testicle and/or the epididymis (the small tube part next to the testicle).\nThis will cause painful swelling for which you should get treatment urgently.\nBook a consultation online&nbsp;or phone for advice​​.\nHaving multiple genital ulcers could indicate&nbsp;genital herpes&nbsp;which is the same virus that causes cold sores.\nHerpes is an extremely common virus. It sometimes causes symptoms which are mostly self-limiting. This means your immune system will deal with this itself, but it can take a few days for symptoms to settle.\nSometimes the ulcers are itchy before they become sore. There may be pain when peeing because this stings the ulcers.\nMilder cases can be diagnosed and treated by your GP. If you&#8217;re worried about your symptoms, you could also contact your local&nbsp;sexual health service&nbsp;for advice.\nFurther information about herpes simplex viruses\nSometimes hair follicles (the tiny pockets from where each hair grows) around the genitals or groin area can become inflamed. This is called folliculitis. It may be more common if you shave the area. At first it may look like a small pimple. It may be itchy, and sore but in most cases it will resolve on it&#8217;s own. If you have any concerns contact your local&nbsp;sexual health service.\nAnother common cause of new spots or lumps on your genitals is warts.\nAnother possible cause is molluscum. Sometimes, teenagers notice lumps that are completely normal.\nIf you think that the lumps you have noticed are likely to be&nbsp;genital warts&nbsp;they might clear up on&nbsp;their own. One third of warts disappear within 6 months.\nYour GP practice may be able to prescribe treatment for you or refer you to a sexual health clinic if treatment doesn&#8217;t work. Sexual health services available may vary across Scotland.\nGenital skin can be sensitive. Itching is often a sign that you&#8217;re doing something, or using a product, that&#8217;s irritating the skin. If itching is your only symptom, it isn&#8217;t often related to an STI.\nItching around or inside the vagina is often due to&nbsp;thrush. You can get treatment over the counter at your&nbsp;local pharmacy.\nIf you&#8217;ve changed your method of&nbsp;contraception, then you might notice a change in your bleeding pattern. This should settle but if you have any concerns, talk to your contraception provider.\nChlamydia&nbsp;can sometimes cause bleeding after sex or between periods. If you have had unprotected sex with a new sexual partner and notice this type of bleeding, then&nbsp;get tested for STIs.\nRead about what to do if you have a change in your vaginal discharge"

        "description": "Genital warts are a common sexually transmitted infection (STI).\nThey are caused by a virus called Human Papilloma Virus (HPV).\nIt can take a few weeks or months for genital warts to appear after becoming infected.\nGenital warts are usually small, rough lumps on the skin.\nThey can appear:\n- around the vagina and on the penis\n- around the anus\n- on the skin between the genitals and the anus\nGenital warts may:\n- appear on their own or in a group (groups of warts can look like a cauliflower)\n- feel soft or firm\n- be white, red, skin-coloured, or darker than the surrounding skin\nThey don&#8217;t usually cause symptoms but can sometimes be painful, itchy or bleed.\nThe test for genital warts involves an examination of the genital area.\nIf you think you might have genital warts, get checked for free by:\n- contacting your GP practice for an appointment\n- booking an appointment at your local sexual health service\nWarts must be diagnosed by a doctor or nurse.\nTreatment for genital warts is not always needed. They sometimes disappear on their own within 6 months.\nIf treatment is recommended, it&#8217;ll be prescribed by your doctor.\nYour doctor or nurse may advise you to avoid sex while you&#8217;re having treatment for genital warts.\nThe type of treatment you&#8217;ll be offered depends on what your warts are like. Your doctor or nurse will discuss this with you.\nTreatment options include:\n- cream or liquid\n- freezing\n- surgery\nYou can usually apply this to the warts yourself a few times a week for several weeks.\nA doctor or nurse freezes the warts with liquid nitrogen, usually every week for 4 weeks.\nA doctor or nurse can cut or burn the warts off. This is usually only recommended if the warts are not responding or are too large for cream or freezing. Side effects of these treatments include:\n- bleeding\n- wound infection\n- scarring\nGenital warts are not usually harmful during pregnancy.\nDuring pregnancy, genital warts may:\n- multiply and get bigger (they may be removed if they&#8217;re very big)\n- become more easily irritated\n- be passed on to the baby during childbirth, but this is very rare (the HPV virus can cause infection in the baby&#8217;s throat or genitals)\nMost creams, liquids and ointments used to treat genital warts are not recommended during pregnancy. Freezing can be used but it&#8217;s often not very successful.\nGenital warts usually disappear on their own within 6 weeks after childbirth.\nYou can get genital warts from skin to skin contact.\nOther ways of getting genital warts include:\n- unprotected vaginal, anal, or oral sex (sex without a condom)\n- sharing sex toys with an infected person\nThe best way to reduce your risk of STIs is to practice safer sex. This means using a condom for vaginal, anal, and oral sex, and when sharing sex toys.\nYou can get warts even if you use condoms, as a condom does not cover the whole genital area.\nThe HPV vaccination will reduce your risk of getting HPV virus which causes warts. However, it doesn&#8217;t treat warts once you have them.\nGenital warts are not cancer and don&#8217;t cause cancer. They&#8217;re caused by a different strain of HPV.\nHPV vaccination is offered to every person aged 11 to 13. The vaccine can protect against cervical cancer also protects against genital warts.\nThe HPV vaccine is also offered to men who have sex with men (MSM) and trans people aged up to 45 years.\nIf you didn&#8217;t have the vaccine at school and don’t fulfill the above criteria, you can pay for the vaccine privately.\nIf you’ve been diagnosed with genital warts it&#8217;s recommended that you&#8217;re tested for all STIs including:\n- chlamydia\n- gonorrhoea\n- syphilis\n- HIV"

        "disease": "Germ cell tumours",
        "description": "Most children who develop germ cell tumours will be cured.\nMore children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.\nIt&#8217;s devastating to hear that your child has cancer. At times it can feel overwhelming but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.\nUnderstanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. Your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information, and if you have any questions, it&#8217;s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.\nGerm cell tumours can appear at any age. They develop from cells that produce eggs or sperm so germ cell tumours can affect the ovaries or testes. However, it&#8217;s possible for a germ cell tumour to develop in other parts of the body.\nAs a baby develops during pregnancy, the cells producing eggs or sperm normally move to the ovaries or testes. However, occasionally they can settle in other parts of the body where they can develop into tumours. The most common places for this to happen are the bottom of the spine (sacrococcygeal), the brain, chest, and abdomen.\nGerm cell tumours are sometimes given different names based on their characteristics. These include yolk-sac tumours, germinomas, embryonal carcinomas, mature teratomas and immature teratomas.\nThey may be non-cancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant). Malignant tumours have the ability to grow and spread to other parts of the body.\nBenign tumours do not spread but may cause problems by pressing on nearby tissue and organs.\nImmature teratomas fall between benign and malignant. They can spread within the abdomen but not beyond, and can be removed with an operation.\nThe cause of germ cell tumours is unknown but research into the causes of different cancers is ongoing.\nThe symptoms depend on where the tumour develops. Usually it starts with a lump that can either be felt or causes other symptoms.\nDifferent tests may be needed to diagnose a germ cell tumour. Usually, the doctor will remove a sample of tissue from the lump (a&nbsp;biopsy) for examination under a microscope to find out if it is a cancer or not.\nCT&nbsp;or&nbsp;MRI scans&nbsp;may be used to see the exact position of a tumour within the body. Chest X-rays may be taken to see if there’s a tumour in the lungs.\nGerm cell tumours often produce proteins called tumour markers that can be measured in the blood. The ones that are produced by germ cell tumours are alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG). Your child will have blood tests to check these tumour markers when they are being diagnosed. The doctors will continue to check these during treatment and after treatment is over.\nSometimes a germ cell tumour can be diagnosed with a tumour marker and scan results so that a biopsy isn’t necessary. This is particularly so if surgery is not needed for treatment, for example if the tumour is in the brain.\nThe stage of a cancer describes its size and whether it has spread from where it started. Knowing the stage helps doctors to decide on the most appropriate treatment.\nGenerally cancer is divided into 4 stages:\n- stage 1&nbsp;– the cancer is small, has not spread and has been completely removed\n- stages 2 and 3&nbsp;– the cancer is larger and may not have been completely removed, or may have spread to nearby organs\n- stage 4 – the cancer has spread to other parts of the body\nCancer that has spread to distant parts of the body and formed new tumours is known as secondary or metastatic cancer.\nThe treatment your child will have usually depends on a number of factors, including the size, position and stage of the tumour. It usually includes either surgery or chemotherapy, or a combination.\nA benign tumour can be cured if it is removed by surgery. It may mean removing a testicle or an ovary if this is where the tumour started.\nIf the tumour is malignant and can be completely removed with surgery,&nbsp;chemotherapy&nbsp;is not always needed, especially if it began in the testis or ovary. If the tumour cannot be removed easily or has spread, your child will be given chemotherapy.\nChemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells. Germ cell tumours are very sensitive to chemotherapy. It’s usually given as injections and drips (infusions) into a vein.\nA combination of drugs is usually given every 3 weeks for 3 or 5 months. The length of time chemotherapy is given for depends on the position of the tumour, the level of AFP, and whether or not the tumour has spread.\nTreatment of malignant germ cell tumours in the brain is a little different. Although they are very sensitive to chemotherapy, treatment with radiotherapy is also needed.&nbsp;Radiotherapy&nbsp;is the use of high-energy rays to destroy cancer cells. Unlike germ cell tumours elsewhere in the body, it’s not always necessary to remove germ cell tumours in the brain with surgery.\nTreatment often causes side effects, and your child’s doctor will discuss these with you before treatment starts. The operation your child has will be individually planned to try to reduce any possible problems. The surgeon and specialist nurse will discuss this with you.\nThe side effects of chemotherapy usually gradually improve when treatment is over and many of them can be well controlled.\nThe side effects of treatment depend on the drugs used but can include:\n- feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting)\n- hair loss\n- increased risk of infection\n- bruising and bleeding\n- tiredness\n- diarrhoea\nA small number of children may develop long-term side effects of treatment, sometimes many years later. These are not common but may include problems with how the kidneys or lungs work and some hearing loss. Your child’s specialist doctor or nurse will tell you more about any possible late side effects.\nIf your child has only one ovary or testis removed, they’ll usually still be able to have children in the future.\nMany children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. Specialist doctors carry out trials for children’s cancers. If appropriate, your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial and will answer any questions you have. Written information is often provided to help explain things.\nTaking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide if it’s right for your child.\nSometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child’s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The&nbsp;Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group&nbsp;(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.\nYour child will continue to have regular blood tests during and after treatment, to check their levels of AFP and HCG. If the levels rise, this indicates that the tumour might have come back and further treatment is needed.\nIf you have specific concerns about your child’s condition and treatment, it’s best to discuss them with your child’s doctor, who knows the situation in detail.\nAs a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time.\nYour child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer.\nFurther information and advice if your child has cancer"

It normally gets better without treatment, but it can make you feel very ill. It normally lasts for 2 to 3 weeks, but in some cases you can feel ill for months.\nIt can also be known as infectious mononucleosis, or ‘mono’.\nGlandular fever is most common in 15 to 24 year olds.\nCommon symptoms include:\n- a high temperature (fever)\n- a very&nbsp;sore throat\n- swollen glands&nbsp;in the neck\n- fatigue (extreme tiredness)\n- headache\nOther symptoms include:\n- feeling generally unwell\n- aching muscles\n- chills\n- sweating a lot\n- loss of appetite\n- pain around or behind your eyes\n- swollen tonsils and adenoids (small lumps of tissue at the back of the nose), which may affect your breathing\n- a very red throat that oozes fluid\n- small red or purple spots on the roof of your mouth\n- a rash\n- swelling or ‘puffiness’ around your eyes\n- a tender or swollen tummy\n- jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes)\nComplete this guide to assess your symptoms and find out more about where to get help.\nTo diagnose glandular fever, your GP will first ask about your symptoms. They will carry out a physical examination. They’ll look for signs of glandular fever, like swollen glands, tonsils, liver and spleen.\nYour GP may also recommend a&nbsp;blood test&nbsp;to help confirm the diagnosis and rule out infections that can cause similar symptoms.\nGlandular fever will normally get better on its own. But there are things you can do help ease the symptoms while you wait for your body to control the infection.\nOccasionally,&nbsp;antibiotics&nbsp;or&nbsp;corticosteroids&nbsp;may be prescribed if you develop complications of glandular fever.\nSome people with particularly severe symptoms may need to be looked after in hospital for a few days.\nGlandular fever is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). This virus is found in the saliva of infected people and can be spread through:\n- kissing\n- exposure to coughs and sneezes\n- sharing cups, glasses and unwashed cutlery\n- sharing toothbrushes\nEBV may be found in the saliva of someone who has had glandular fever several months after their symptoms pass. Some people may continue to have the virus in their saliva on and off for years.\nYou’re infectious for up to 7 weeks before you get symptoms, and you may be infectious for several months after being unwell.\nTo help stop you spreading glandular fever when you’re infected:\nComplications linked with glandular fever are uncommon. If they they do occur they can be serious. They can include:\n- liver conditions like hepatitis\n- kidney conditions\n- heart problems like&nbsp;inflammation of the heart\n- blood conditions like&nbsp;sepsis\n- a ruptured (burst) spleen, which may need to be treated with surgery\n- long-term tiredness or fatigue"

You may experience pain or discharge in these areas. Gonorrhoea in the throat usually has no symptoms.\nHaving the infection during pregnancy can result in giving birth to the baby early (premature birth). Gonorrhoea can be passed on to the baby during birth and can result in eye infections in the infant.\nIf you think you might have gonorrhoea, get tested for free by:\n- booking an appointment at your local sexual health service (if you have symptoms)\n- contacting your GP practice for an appointment (if you have symptoms)\n- ordering a home test kit (if you do not have symptoms)\nServices available may vary depending on where you live.\nThe test for gonorrhoea is simple, painless and very reliable. It involves sending a sample from the area of the body thought to be infected to a lab for analysis.\nYou usually don&#8217;t have to be examined by a doctor or nurse and can often collect the sample yourself.\nThe 2 main ways the sample can be collected are:\n- using a swab – a small cotton bud is gently wiped over the area that might be infected, such as inside the vagina, throat, or inside the anus\n- urine sample (if you have a penis) – this is more accurate if it&#8217;s at least 1 or 2 hours after you last peed\nPeople who have had anal or oral sex may have a swab taken from their anus or throat.\nSome sexual health clinics may be able to carry out rapid tests and give you your test results straight away. Otherwise, you&#8217;ll have to wait up to 2 weeks to get the results.\nIf you have gonorrhoea, your partner will be offered testing and treatment.\nAntibiotics will treat the gonorrhoea infection. These can be given in pill form or as an injection.\nSome strains of gonorrhoea are becoming resistant to antibiotics. This can make it more difficult to treat. You may be tested again 3 weeks later to check the antibiotics have worked.\nIf there&#8217;s a high chance you have gonorrhoea, you may be given treatment before you get your results back.\nYou may also be offered treatment if your partner (s) is found to have gonorrhoea.\nTell the doctor or nurse if you:\n- are pregnant\n- think you might be pregnant\n- are breastfeeding\nThis may make a difference to the antibiotic you&#8217;re prescribed.\nIf your infection is untreated you may pass it on to other sexual partners.\nIf gonorrhoea is left untreated in women, it can spread to the womb and cause a serious condition called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). This is a major cause of ectopic pregnancy and infertility in women.\nIf men are not treated, the infection may spread to the testicles and cause discomfort. This could affect your fertility.\nDo not have sex until you and your partner have both finished the treatment. You should also wait until you&#8217;ve had the results of the 2 week test to prevent being infected again.\nGonorrhoea is passed through unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex (without a condom).\nIt can also be passed on by:\n- sharing sex toys that aren&#8217;t washed or covered with a new condom each time they&#8217;re used\n- infected semen or vaginal fluid getting into your eye\n- it can also be passed to a newborn during childbirth\nThe best way to prevent all sexually transmitted infections is to practice safer sex. This means using a condom for vaginal, anal or oral sex.\nIf you have been diagnosed with gonorrhoea you should get tested for all STIs including:\n- syphilis\n- HIV\n- chlamydia"

        "disease": "Gout",
        "description": "Gout is a type of arthritis in which small crystals form inside and around the joints. It causes sudden flares of severe pain and swelling.\nGout can be very painful, but treatments are available to help relieve the symptoms and prevent further flares.\nAny joint can be affected by gout, but it usually affects joints towards the ends of the limbs, like\n- toes, especially the big toe\n- ankles\n- knees\n- fingers\nSigns and symptoms of gout include:\n- severe pain in 1 or more joints\n- the joint feeling hot and very tender\n- swelling in and around the affected joint\n- red, shiny skin over the affected joint\nAlmost everyone with gout will experience further flares at some point, usually within a year.\nFlares of gout tend to:\n- occur at night, but they can happen at any time\n- develop quickly over a few hours\n- last between 3 and 10 days\n- come back – you may experience flares every few months or years\n- become more frequent over time if not treated\nAfter a gout flare the affected joint should start to return to normal. But, the problem can persist if treatment isn’t started early.\nIt’s difficult to predict how often flares will occur and when exactly they&#8217;ll happen.\nRepeated gout flares can lead to joint pain and joint deformities.\nThis could mean you have an infection inside the joint (septic arthritis).\nIf your GP is closed, phone 111.\nYour GP will ask about your symptoms and medical history, and examine the affected area, to help make a diagnosis.\nThey may also ask you about your diet and whether there&#8217;s any history of gout in your family.\nSometimes further tests will be needed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes.\nA sample of fluid may be taken from the affected joint. The fluid can be checked for the small crystals that cause gout. It can be tested for infection to rule out septic arthritis.\nA blood test known as a serum urate test may be used to measure the amount of urate in your blood. A high level of urate is often linked with gout.\nYour GP may wait for 4 weeks after a flare of gout before carrying out this test. The level of urate in your blood often falls during a flare and so levels measured when you have recovered will give a better indication of your risk of future flares.\nYou may also be tested to check your levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in your body. High CRP levels can be found in patients with acute inflammation. This is frequently found in patients who are suffering from gout flares.\nAn X-ray is rarely used to diagnose gout because the condition isn’t usually detectable using this method.\nBut, an X-ray is sometimes used to help rule out similar conditions that affect the joints, like chondrocalcinosis. Chondrocalcinosis is a build-up of calcium crystals in the joints. It can also be used to assess whether there&#8217;s been any joint damage due to repeated or persistent flares of gout.\nAn ultrasound scan of an affected joint is a simple and safe investigation that’s increasingly used to detect crystals in the joints. It can also detect crystals deep in the skin that aren’t obvious during a physical examination.\nGout is caused by an inflammatory reaction to urate crystals formed in and around the joints. You have urate in your blood but if levels rise too high, then this allows the build of tiny sharp crystals. In a flare of gout a reaction to these crystals results in pain, redness and swelling of the joint.\nThings that may increase your chances of getting gout include:\n- obesity, high blood pressure and/or diabetes\n- having a close relative with gout\n- kidney problems\n- eating foods that cause a build-up of urate, like red meat, offal and seafood\n- drinking too much beer, spirits, fruit juices or sugary drinks\n- some medications like diuretics, beta-blockers, niacin and some chemotherapy medicines\nIf you have gout, treatment is available from your GP to:\n- relieve symptoms during a flare\n- prevent further flares by taking urate lowering medicines like allopurinol\nSymptoms can be relieved using ice packs and by taking medications like:\n- non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\n- colchicine\n- corticosteroids\nWith preventative treatment, like allopurinol, many people are able to reduce their urate levels enough to dissolve the crystals that cause gout. This means they&#8217;ll have no more flares. But, lifelong treatment is usually required.\nWhen using an ice pack, apply it to your joint for around 20 minutes. Don’t apply ice directly to your skin and don’t apply it for more than 20 minutes at a time because this could damage the skin.\nIf necessary, you can keep reapplying an ice pack to your skin during a flare. But, you should wait until your skin has returned to a normal temperature first.\nMaking some practical changes to your daily routine can also help reduce your risk of further flares of gout, including:\n- losing weight if you&#8217;re overweight\n- maintaining a healthy weight\n- avoiding foods containing high levels of purine (the chemical involved in the production of urate), like red meat, offal, oily fish, seafood and foods containing yeast extract\n- avoiding sugary drinks and snacks\n- taking regular exercise – try activities that don’t put too much strain on your joints\n- drinking plenty of water – keeping yourself well hydrated will reduce the risk of crystals forming in your joints\n- cutting down on alcohol – avoid beer and spirits in particular and don’t binge drink\nThere&#8217;s evidence that taking regular vitamin C supplements can lower your urate levels, but the effect may only be small. Talk to your GP first if you’re thinking about taking vitamin C supplements, as they aren’t suitable or safe for everyone.\nSometimes gout can lead to further problems, particularly if it’s left untreated.\nThese can include:\n- kidney stones\n- small firm lumps of urate crystals under the skin called tophi\n- permanent joint damage\nGout can also affect your mood, work and home life. The severe pain that gout causes can make it difficult to do everyday tasks and to get around. This can lead to feelings of depression or anxiety.\nIf gout is affecting your mood or making everyday life difficult, talk to your GP. They&#8217;ll be able to offer treatment and support.\nThere are also organisations that offer information and advice for people who have gout, like Versus Arthritis.\nPseudogout can look and feel like gout, but it&#8217;s caused by a reaction to a different crystal in the joints. It more commonly affects the knees or wrists."

People who are experiencing new or ongoing symptoms should contact a healthcare professional for assessment and diagnosis.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nRead more about self-managing hip problems\nGreater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), also known as lateral hip pain or trochanteric bursitis, is a common and painful condition which affects the outer side of the hip and thigh. It occurs when the tissues which lie over the outside of the hip bone (greater trochanter) become irritated.\nThe soft tissues that attach to the outside of the hip include tendons and bursa. When these become overloaded they are the primary sources of pain caused by GTPS.\nIt&#8217;s more common in females and in those aged between 40 and 60 years old but can affect any age.\nThese can vary from person to person.\nPeople may experience some or all of these symptoms including:\n- Pain in the hip/thigh/buttock area.\n- Worse pain when lying on your side or with direct pressure.\n- Pain increasing with exercise such as periods of walking, standing or running.\n- Tenderness to touch.\n- Pain sitting with your legs crossed.\n- Pain when standing on the affected leg (sometimes called hanging on the hip)\n- Pain when climbing stairs\n- Pain when lifting legs in/out a car or bed\nOften it can occur for no apparent reason but these are some factors which appear to contribute to it:\n- a sudden increased load on your hip\n- a change to your activity levels such as increased walking distances or pace\n- increased pressure to your hip area through sitting or standing in one position for too long or weight bearing on one leg\n- reduced strength and flexibility of the muscles around the hip and buttock\n- having a sedentary, inactive lifestyle or being overweight\n- an injury such as a fall on to the side of your hip area\n- hormone changes may also influence this condition\n- this can also be related to osteoarthritis of the hips and knees or low back pain\nAn important step in your recovery is identifying which activities are causing or increasing your pain. Modifying those activities can help to reduce symptoms.\nThe key to success is slow progressive loading of the soft tissues through exercise that strengthen the muscles involved.\nRead more about exercises for greater trochanteric pain syndrome\nOver time it is important to gradually increase the exercises to help the tendons and muscles become stronger, less painful and more able to cope with your normal activity levels.\nOther ways to help improve symptoms include:\n- spreading your weight evenly across both feet and not leaning on just one leg.\n- avoiding low chairs.\n- avoid sitting with your legs crossed.\n- avoid sleeping on the painful side. Try lying on your back with a pillow under your knees or lie on your good side with a pillow between your legs to keep them in line with your hip joints.\n- try to keep active and stay at work even if you have to modify your duties.\n- losing weight if you are overweight.\nThis condition can often take 6 to 12 months of rehabilitation to settle, but this will depend on the cause.\nIt is normal to have flare ups during this time.

It&#8217;s much less common in children. It&#8217;s one of the main reasons that adults lose teeth, but it is preventable.\nHealthy gums should be pink, firm and keep your teeth securely in place. Your gums shouldn&#8217;t bleed when you touch or brush them.\nGum disease isn&#8217;t always painful and you may be unaware you have it. It&#8217;s important to have regular dental check-ups.\nThe initial symptoms of gum disease can include:\n- red and swollen gums\n- bleeding gums after brushing your teeth or after using interdental brushes or floss\nThis stage of gum disease is called gingivitis.\nYour dentist can check the health of your gums.\nIf gingivitis is untreated, the tissues and bone that support the teeth can also become affected. This is known as periodontitis, or periodontal disease.\nSymptoms of periodontitis can include:\n- bad breath (halitosis)\n- an unpleasant taste in your mouth\n- loose teeth that can make eating difficult\n- gum abscesses (collections of pus that develop under your gums or teeth)\n- sensitive of painful teeth\nGum disease is caused by a build-up of plaque on the teeth. Plaque is a sticky substance that contains bacteria.\nSome bacteria in plaque are harmless, but some are harmful for the health of your gums. If you don&#8217;t remove plaque from your teeth by brushing them, it builds up and irritates your gums. This can lead to redness with bleeding, swelling and soreness.\nThere are a number of things you can do to help prevent gum disease.\n\n- brush your teeth twice a day, for 2 minutes at a time\n- use fluoride toothpaste\n- clean between your teeth regularly, using interdental brushes or floss\n- visit the dentist for check-ups\n\nIt&#8217;s important to have regular dental check-ups so any problems with your teeth and gums can be detected and treated early.\nFurther information about dental check-ups\nIf you have an increased risk of developing gum problems – for example, if you smoke or have diabetes – you may be advised to visit your dentist more often so your teeth and gums can be closely monitored.\nIf you have untreated gum disease that develops into periodontitis, it can lead to further complications, such as:\n- gum abscesses (painful collections of pus)\n- receding gums\n- loose teeth\n- loss of teeth"

However, when symptoms do occur, they may include:\n- bleeding after passing a stool (the blood is usually bright red)\n- itchy bottom\n- a lump hanging down outside of the anus, which may need to be pushed back in after passing a stool\n- a mucus discharge after passing a stool\n- soreness, redness and swelling around your anus\nHaemorrhoids aren&#8217;t usually painful, unless their blood supply slows down or is interrupted.\nSee your GP if&nbsp;you have persistent or severe symptoms of haemorrhoids. You should always get any rectal bleeding checked out, so your doctor can rule out more potentially serious causes.\nThe symptoms of haemorrhoids often clear up on their own or with simple treatments that can be bought from a pharmacy without a prescription. However, speak to your GP if your symptoms don&#8217;t get better or if you experience pain or bleeding.\nYour GP can often diagnose haemorrhoids using a simple internal examination of your back passage, although they may need to refer you to a colorectal specialist for diagnosis and treatment.\nSome people with haemorrhoids are reluctant to see their GP. However, there’s no need to be embarrassed, because GPs are very used to diagnosing and treating haemorrhoids.\nRead more about diagnosing haemorrhoids.\nThe exact cause of haemorrhoids is unclear, but&nbsp;they&#8217;re associated with increased pressure in the&nbsp;blood vessels in and around your anus. This pressure can cause the blood vessels in your back passage to become swollen and inflamed.\nMany cases are thought to be caused by too much straining on the toilet, due to prolonged constipation – this is often due to a lack of&nbsp;fibre in a person&#8217;s diet. Chronic (long-term)&nbsp;diarrhoea can also make you more vulnerable to getting haemorrhoids.\nOther factors that might increase your risk of developing haemorrhoids include:\n- being overweight or obese\n- age&nbsp;– as you get older, your body&#8217;s supporting tissues get weaker, increasing your risk of haemorrhoids\n- being&nbsp;pregnant&nbsp;– which can place increased pressure on your pelvic blood vessels, causing them to enlarge (read more about common pregnancy problems)\n- having a family history of haemorrhoids\n- regularly lifting heavy objects\n- a&nbsp;persistent&nbsp;cough or repeated vomiting\n- sitting down for long periods of time\nHaemorrhoid symptoms often&nbsp;settle down after&nbsp;a few days, without needing treatment. Haemorrhoids that occur during pregnancy often get better after giving birth.\nHowever, making lifestyle changes to reduce the strain on&nbsp;the blood vessels in and around your anus is often recommended. These can include:\n- gradually&nbsp;increasing the amount of fibre in your diet – good sources of fibre include fruit, vegetables, wholegrain rice, wholewheat pasta and bread, pulses and beans, seeds, nuts and oats\n- drinking plenty of fluid&nbsp;– particularly water,&nbsp;but avoiding or&nbsp;cutting down on caffeine and alcohol\n- not delaying going to the toilet – ignoring the urge to empty your bowels can make your stools harder and drier, which can lead to straining when you do go to the toilet\n- avoiding medication that causes constipation – such as painkillers that contain codeine\n- losing weight (if you&#8217;re overweight)\n- exercising regularly – can help prevent constipation, reduce your blood pressure and help you lose weight\nThese measures can also reduce&nbsp;the risk of haemorrhoids returning, or even developing&nbsp;in the first place.\nMedication that you apply directly to your back passage (known as topical treatments) or tablets bought from a pharmacy or prescribed by your GP may ease your symptoms and make it easier for you to pass stools.\nThere are various treatment options for more severe haemorrhoids. One of these options is banding, which is a non-surgical procedure where a very tight elastic band is put around the base of the haemorrhoid to cut off&nbsp;its blood supply. The haemorrhoid should fall off&nbsp;after about a week.\nSurgery carried out under&nbsp;general anaesthetic (where you&#8217;re unconscious) is sometimes&nbsp;used to&nbsp;remove or shrink&nbsp;large or external haemorrhoids.\nRead more about&nbsp;treating haemorrhoids&nbsp;and surgery for haemorrhoids.\nYour GP can diagnose haemorrhoids (piles) by examining your back passage to check for swollen blood vessels.\nSome people with haemorrhoids are reluctant to see their GP. However, there’s no need to be embarrassed – all GPs are used to diagnosing and treating piles.\nIt&#8217;s important to tell your GP about all of your symptoms – for example, tell them if you&#8217;ve recently lost a lot of weight, if your bowel movements have changed, or if your&nbsp;stools have become dark or sticky.\nYour GP may examine the outside of your anus to see if you have visible haemorrhoids, and they may also carry out an internal examination called a&nbsp;digital rectal examination (DRE).\nDuring a DRE, your GP will wear gloves and use lubricant. Using their finger, they&#8217;ll&nbsp;feel for any abnormalities in your back passage. A DRE shouldn&#8217;t be painful, but you may feel some slight discomfort.\nIn some cases, further internal examination using a proctoscope may be needed. A proctoscope is a thin hollow tube with a light on the end that&#8217;s inserted into your anus.\nThis allows&nbsp;your doctor to see your entire anal canal (the last section of the large intestine).\nGPs are sometimes able to carry out a proctoscopy. However, not all GPs have the correct training or access to the right equipment, so you may need to&nbsp;go to a&nbsp;hospital clinic&nbsp;to have the procedure.\nAfter you&#8217;ve had a rectal examination or proctoscopy, your doctor will be able to&nbsp;determine what type of haemorrhoids you have.\nHaemorrhoids can develop internally or externally. Internal haemorrhoids develop in the upper two-thirds of your anal canal and external haemorrhoids in the lower third (closest to your anus). The nerves in the&nbsp;lower part can transmit pain messages, while the nerves&nbsp;in the upper part&nbsp;can&#8217;t.\nHaemorrhoids can be further classified, depending on their size and severity. They can be:\n- first degree – small swellings that develop on the inside lining of the anus and aren&#8217;t visible from outside the anus\n- second degree – larger swellings that may come out of your anus when you go to the toilet, before disappearing inside again\n- third degree – one or more small soft lumps that hang down from the anus and can be pushed back inside&nbsp;(prolapsing and reducible)\n- fourth degree – larger lumps that hang down from the anus and can&#8217;t be pushed back inside&nbsp;(irreducible)\nIt&#8217;s useful for doctors to know what type&nbsp;and size of haemorrhoid you have, as they can then decide on the best treatment.\nRead more about treating haemorrhoids.\nHaemorrhoids (piles) often clear up by themselves after a few days. However, there are many treatments that can reduce itching and discomfort.\nMaking simple dietary changes and not straining on the toilet are often recommended first.\nCreams, ointments and suppositories&nbsp;(which you&nbsp;insert into your bottom) are available from pharmacies without a prescription. They can be used to relieve any swelling and&nbsp;discomfort.\nIf more intensive treatment is needed, the type will depend on where your haemorrhoids are in your anal canal – the lower third (closest to your anus)&nbsp;or the upper two-thirds. The lower third contain nerves which can transmit pain, while the upper two-thirds do not.\nNon-surgical treatments for haemorrhoids&nbsp;in the lower part of the canal&nbsp;are likely to be very painful, because the nerves in this area can detect pain. In these cases,&nbsp;haemorrhoid surgery&nbsp;will usually be recommended.\nThe various treatments for&nbsp;haemorrhoids are outlined below.&nbsp;\nIf&nbsp;constipation&nbsp;is thought to be the cause of&nbsp;your haemorrhoids, you need to&nbsp;keep your stools soft and regular, so that you don&#8217;t strain when passing stools.\nYou can do this by increasing the amount of fibre in your diet. Good sources of fibre include wholegrain bread, cereal, fruit and vegetables.\nYou should also&nbsp;drink plenty of water and avoid caffeine (found in tea, coffee and cola).\nWhen going to the toilet, you should:\n- avoid straining to pass stools, because it may make your haemorrhoids worse\n- use&nbsp;moist toilet paper,&nbsp;rather than dry toilet paper, or baby wipes&nbsp;to clean your bottom&nbsp;after passing a stool\n- pat the area&nbsp;around your bottom, rather than rubbing it\nRead more about preventing constipation.\nVarious creams, ointments and suppositories&nbsp;(which are inserted into your bottom) are available from pharmacies without a prescription. They can be used to relieve any swelling and&nbsp;discomfort.\nThese medicines&nbsp;should only be used for five to seven days at a time. If you use them&nbsp;for longer, they may irritate the sensitive skin around your anus.&nbsp;Any medication should be combined with the diet and self-care advice discussed above.\nThere&#8217;s no evidence to suggest that one method is more effective than another. Ask your pharmacist for advice about which product is most suitable for you, and always read the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine before using it.\nDon&#8217;t use more than one product at once.\nIf you have severe inflammation in and around your back passage, your GP&nbsp;may prescribe corticosteroid cream, which&nbsp;contains steroids.\nYou shouldn&#8217;t use corticosteroid cream for more than a week at a time, because it can make the skin around your anus thinner and the irritation worse.\nCommon painkilling medication, such as paracetamol, can help relieve the pain of haemorrhoids.\nHowever, if you have excessive bleeding, avoid using non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, because it can make rectal bleeding worse. You should also avoid using codeine painkillers, because they can cause constipation.\nYour GP may prescribe products that contain&nbsp;local anaesthetic&nbsp;to treat painful haemorrhoids. Like over-the-counter topical treatments, these should only be used for a few days, because they can make the skin around&nbsp;your back passage more sensitive.\nIf you&#8217;re constipated, your GP may prescribe a laxative. Laxatives are a type of medicine that can help you empty your bowels.\nIf dietary changes and medication don&#8217;t improve your symptoms,&nbsp;your GP may refer you to a specialist. They can confirm whether you have haemorrhoids and recommend appropriate treatment.\nIf you have haemorrhoids in the upper part of your anal canal, non-surgical procedures such as banding and sclerotherapy may be recommended.\nBanding&nbsp;involves placing&nbsp;a very tight elastic band around the base of your haemorrhoids to cut off their&nbsp;blood supply. The haemorrhoids should then fall off&nbsp;within about a week of having the treatment.\nBanding is usually a day procedure that doesn&#8217;t need an&nbsp;anaesthetic, and most people can get back to their normal activities the next day. You may feel some pain or discomfort for a day or so afterwards. Normal painkillers are usually adequate, but your GP can prescribe something stronger, if needed.\nYou may not realise that your haemorrhoids have fallen off, as they should pass out of your body when you go to the toilet. If&nbsp;you notice some mucus discharge within a week of the procedure, it&nbsp;usually means that the haemorrhoids have fallen off.\nDirectly after the procedure, you may notice blood on the toilet paper after going to the toilet.&nbsp;This is normal, but there shouldn&#8217;t be a lot of bleeding. If you pass a lot of bright red blood or&nbsp;blood clots (solid lumps of blood), go to&nbsp;your nearest accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department immediately.\nUlcers (open sores) can occur at the site of the banding, although these usually heal without needing further treatment.\nA treatment called sclerotherapy may be used as an alternative to banding.\nDuring sclerotherapy,&nbsp;a&nbsp;chemical solution is injected into the blood vessels in your back passage. This relieves pain by numbing the nerve endings at the site of the injection. It also hardens the tissue of the haemorrhoid so that a scar is formed. After about 4&nbsp;to 6&nbsp;weeks, the haemorrhoid should decrease in size or shrivel up.\nAfter the injection, you should avoid strenuous exercise for the rest of the day.&nbsp;You may experience minor pain for a while and may bleed a little. You should be able to resume normal activities, including work, the day after the procedure.\nElectrotherapy, also known as electrocoagulation, is another&nbsp;alternative to banding&nbsp;for people with&nbsp;smaller&nbsp;haemorrhoids.\nDuring the procedure, a&nbsp;device called a proctoscope is inserted into the anus to locate&nbsp;the haemorrhoid.&nbsp;An electric current is then passed through a small metal probe that&#8217;s placed at the base of the haemorrhoid, above the dentate line. The specialist&nbsp;can control the electric current using controls attached to the probe.\nThe aim of electrotherapy&nbsp;is to cause the blood supplying the haemorrhoid to coagulate (thicken), which causes the haemorrhoid to shrink. If necessary, more than one haemorrhoid can be treated during each session.\nElectrotherapy&nbsp;can either be carried out on outpatient basis using a low electric current, or a higher dose can be given while the person is under a&nbsp;general anaesthetic or spinal anaesthetic.\nYou may experience some mild pain during or after electrotherapy, but in most cases this doesn&#8217;t last long.&nbsp;Rectal bleeding is another possible&nbsp;side effect of the procedure, but this is usually&nbsp;short-lived.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nElectrotherapy&nbsp;is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), and has been shown to be an effective method of treating smaller haemorrhoids. It can also be used&nbsp;as an alternative to surgery for&nbsp;treating larger haemorrhoids, but there&#8217;s less evidence of its effectiveness.\nAlthough most haemorrhoids can be treated using the methods described above, around 1 in every 10 people will eventually need surgery.\nSurgery is particularly useful for haemorrhoids that have developed below the dentate line because, unlike non-surgical treatments, anaesthetic is used to ensure you don’t feel any pain.\nThere are many different types of surgery that can be used to treat haemorrhoids, but they all usually involve either removing the haemorrhoids or reducing their blood supply, causing them to shrink.\nRead more about surgery for haemorrhoids.\nSurgery may be recommended if other treatments for haemorrhoids (piles) haven&#8217;t worked, or if you have haemorrhoids that aren&#8217;t suitable for non-surgical treatment.\nThere are many different surgical procedures for piles.\nA haemorrhoidectomy is an operation to remove haemorrhoids. It&#8217;s usually carried out under general anaesthetic, which means you&#8217;ll be unconscious during the procedure and won&#8217;t feel any pain while it&#8217;s carried out.\nA conventional haemorrhoidectomy involves gently opening the anus so the haemorrhoids can be cut out. You&#8217;ll need to take a week or so off work to recover.\nYou&#8217;ll probably experience significant pain after the operation, but you will be given painkillers. You may still have pain a few weeks after the procedure, which can also be controlled with painkillers. Seek medical advice if you have pain that continues for longer.\nAfter having a haemorrhoidectomy, there&#8217;s around a 1 in 20 chance of the haemorrhoids returning, which is lower than with non-surgical treatments. Adopting or continuing a high-fibre diet after surgery is recommended to reduce this risk.\nHaemorrhoidal artery ligation is an operation to reduce the blood flow to your haemorrhoids.\nIt&#8217;s usually carried out under general anaesthetic and involves inserting a small&nbsp;ultrasound probe into your anus. The probe produces high-frequency sound waves that allow the surgeon to locate the vessels supplying blood to the haemorrhoid.\nEach blood vessel is stitched closed to block the blood supply to the haemorrhoid, which causes the haemorrhoid to shrink over the following days and weeks. The stitches can also be used to reduce prolapsing haemorrhoids (haemorrhoids that hang down from the anus).\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends haemorrhoidal artery ligation as a safe and&nbsp;effective alternative to a haemorrhoidectomy or stapled haemorrhoidopexy (see below). It causes less pain and, in terms of results, a high level of satisfaction has been reported.\nThe recovery time after having haemorrhoidal artery ligation is also quicker&nbsp;compared with other surgical procedures. There&#8217;s a low risk of bleeding, pain when passing stools, or the haemorrhoid becoming prolapsed after this procedure, but these usually improve within a few weeks.\nStapling, also known as stapled haemorrhoidopexy, is an alternative to a conventional haemorrhoidectomy. It&#8217;s sometimes used to treat prolapsed haemorrhoids and is carried out under general anaesthetic.\nThe procedure isn&#8217;t carried out as often as it used to be, because it has a slightly higher risk of serious complications than the alternative treatments available.\nDuring the operation, part of the anorectum (the last section of the large intestine), is stapled. This means the haemorrhoids are less likely to prolapse and it reduces the supply of blood to the haemorrhoids, which causes them to gradually shrink.\nStapling has a shorter recovery time than a traditional haemorrhoidectomy, and you can probably return to work about a week afterwards. It also tends to be a less painful procedure.\nHowever, after stapling, more people experience another prolapsed haemorrhoid compared with having a haemorrhoidectomy. There have also been a very small number of serious complications following the stapling procedure, such as fistula to vagina in women (where a small channel develops between the anal canal and the vagina) or rectal perforation (where a hole develops in the rectum).\nOther treatment options are available, including freezing and laser treatment. However, the number of NHS or private surgeons who perform these treatments is limited.\nAlthough the risk of serious problems is small, complications can occasionally occur after haemorrhoid surgery. These can include:\n- bleeding or passing&nbsp;blood clots,&nbsp;which&nbsp;may happen a week or so after the operation\n- infection, which&nbsp;may lead to a build-up of pus (known as an abscess)&nbsp;– you may be given a short course of&nbsp;antibiotics after surgery to reduce this risk\n- urinary retention (difficulty emptying your bladder)\n- faecal incontinence&nbsp;(the involuntarily passing of&nbsp;stools)&nbsp;\n- anal fistula&nbsp;(a small channel that develops between the anal canal and surface of the skin, near the anus)\n- stenosis (narrowing of the anal canal) – this risk is highest if you have treatment on haemorrhoids that have developed in a ring around the lining of the anal canal\nThese problems can&nbsp;often be treated with medication or more surgery. Ask your surgeon to explain the risks in more detail before deciding to have surgery.\nSeek medical advice from the hospital unit where the surgery was carried out, or from your GP, if you experience:\n- excessive bleeding\n- a high temperature (fever)\n- problems urinating\n- worsening pain or swelling around your anus\nIf you&#8217;re unable to contact the hospital or your GP, phone NHS 24&#8217;s 111 service for advice or visit your nearest accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department."

        "description": "Hand, foot and mouth disease is a common illness. It causes mouth ulcers and spots on the hands and feet.\nIt’s most common in young children, particularly those under 10. But, it can affect older children and adults as well.\nThe infection is not linked to foot and mouth disease, which affects cattle, sheep and pigs.\nThe signs of hand, foot and mouth disease can include:\n- a high temperature (fever)\n- feeling unwell\n- loss of appetite\n- coughing\n- abdominal (tummy) pain\n- a sore throat and mouth\nSource: dermnetnz.org\nSource: dermnetnz.org\nSource: dermnetnz.org\nAfter 1 or 2 days, red spots appear on the tongue and inside the mouth.\nThese quickly develop into larger yellow-grey mouth ulcers with red edges.\nThe ulcers can be painful and make eating, drinking and swallowing difficult. They should pass within a week.\nSoon after the mouth ulcers appear, you may notice a rash made up of small, raised red spots on the skin.\nThese can develop on the:\n- fingers\n- back of the hands\n- palms of the hand\n- soles of the feet\n- buttocks\n- groin\nThe spots may then turn into small blisters with a grey centre.\nThe spots and blisters can sometimes be itchy or uncomfortable and usually last up to 10 days.\nHand, foot and mouth disease can be spread to other people.Check with your GP practice before going. They may suggest a phone consultation.\nSpeak to your GP practice if you’re pregnant and you become infected within a few weeks of your due date. Infection in pregnancy is usually nothing to worry about. But, there’s a small chance it could make your baby ill if you’re infected shortly before you give birth.\nRead more about the risks of hand, foot and mouth disease in pregnancy\nHand, foot and mouth disease can be unpleasant, but it will usually clear up by itself within 7 to 10 days. You can normally look after yourself or your child at home.\nThere&#8217;s no cure for hand, foot and mouth disease.\nAntibiotics won’t help as hand, foot and mouth disease is caused by a virus.\nYou should keep your child away from nursery or school until they’re feeling better. Adults with the condition should stay away from work until they’re feeling better.\nHand, foot and mouth disease is easily passed on to other people. It&#8217;s spread through coughs, sneezes, poo and the fluid in blisters.\nThe infection is caused by many different viruses so you can get it more than once. Most people develop immunity to these viruses as they get older.\nIt’s not always possible to avoid getting hand, foot and mouth disease. But, following this advice can help stop the infection spreading."

        "disease": "Hay fever",
        "description": "Self Help Guide\nLast Updated: \nNext Review Date: \nSearch for a service near you by entering your postcode below.\nPlease input your postcode in the following format: A12 1BC\nNHS inform has more information on this condition.\nYou said:  \nBased on the information you gave us, we made the following recommendation: \nHay fever is a common allergic condition. It affects up to 1 in 5 people at some point in their life.\nYou&#8217;ll experience hay fever symptoms if you have an allergic reaction to pollen.\nPollen is a fine powder released by plants as part of their reproductive cycle. It contains proteins that can cause the nose, eyes, throat and sinuses to become swollen, irritated and inflamed.\nYou can have an allergy to:\n- tree pollen, released during spring\n- grass pollen, released during the end of spring and beginning of summer\n- weed pollen, released late autumn\nMany people find their symptoms improve as they get older.\nComplete our self-help guide to check your symptoms and find out what to do next.\nThe symptoms of hay fever include:\n- frequent sneezing\n- runny or blocked nose\n- itchy, red or watery eyes (allergic conjunctivitis)&nbsp;\n- an itchy throat, mouth, nose and ears\n- cough, caused by postnasal drip (mucus dripping down the throat from the back of the nose)\nLess commonly, you may also experience:\n- the loss of your sense of smell (anosmia)\n- facial pain (caused by blocked sinuses)\n- headaches\n- earache\n- tiredness and fatigue\nIf you have asthma, your asthma symptoms may get worse when you have hay fever.\nThere&#8217;s currently no cure for hay fever. But most people&nbsp;can relieve symptoms with treatment, at least to a certain extent.\nThe most effective way to control hay fever would be to avoid exposure to pollen. However, it&#8217;s very difficult to avoid pollen, particularly during the summer months.\nTreatment options for hay fever include:\n- antihistamines – which help to prevent an allergic reaction\n- corticosteroids (steroids) – which help to reduce inflammation and swelling\nIf you have hay fever, you can get advice and treatment from a pharmacist.\nHay fever can often be controlled using over-the-counter medication from your pharmacist.\nFor severe and persistent hay fever, there&#8217;s also a type of treatment called immunotherapy. It involves being exposed to small amounts of pollen over time. This builds resistance to pollen&#8217;s allergic effects. But it can take many months or even years to work.\nYou can get hay fever at any age. But it usually begins in childhood or during the teenage years. It&#8217;s more common in boys than girls. In adults, men and women are equally affected\nYou&#8217;re more likely to develop hay fever if you have a family history of allergies, particularly asthma or eczema.\nIt&#8217;s sometimes possible to prevent the symptoms of hay fever by taking some basic precautions.\nHay fever doesn&#8217;t pose a serious threat to health. But it can have a negative impact on your quality of life. Very severe hay fever may disrupt your productivity at school or work.\nInflammation of the sinuses (sinusitis) is another common complication of hay fever. Children may also develop a middle ear infection (otitis media) as a result of hay fever."

        "disease": "Head lice and nits",
        "description": "Head lice are tiny insects that live in hair. Nits are the empty egg cases attached to hair that head lice hatch from.\nHead lice are a common problem, particularly in school children aged 4 to 11.\nThey&#8217;re largely harmless, but can live in the hair for a long time if not treated and can be irritating and frustrating to deal with.\nHead lice can be difficult to spot, even when the head is closely inspected.\nThey&#8217;re very small whitish or grey-brown insects that range from the size of a pinhead to the size of a sesame seed.\nLess reliable signs of head lice include:\n- small white eggs or nits (egg cases) in the hair behind the ears or at the back of the neck\n- an itchy scalp\n- a rash on the back of the neck\n- feeling as though something is moving in the hair\nThe only way to be sure someone has head lice is to find a live louse by combing their hair with a special fine-toothed comb. This is called detection combing.\nYou can buy detection combs from your local pharmacy, supermarket or online. Combs with flat-faced teeth spaced 0.2 to 0.3mm apart are best for removing head lice, although combs with smaller gaps can be used to remove eggs and nits (egg cases) after treatment.\nDetection combing can be carried out on dry or wet hair. Dry combing takes less time, but wet combing is more accurate because washing with conditioner stops head lice from moving.\nTo use the wet detection method:\n- wash the hair with ordinary shampoo\n- apply plenty of conditioner\n- use an ordinary, wide-toothed comb to straighten and untangle the hair\n- once the comb moves freely through the hair without dragging, switch to the louse detection comb\n- make sure the teeth of the comb slot into the hair at the roots, with the edge of the teeth lightly touching the scalp\n- draw the comb down from the roots to the ends of the hair with every stroke, and check the comb for lice each time – remove lice by wiping the comb with tissue paper or rinsing it\n- work through the hair, section by section, so that the whole head of hair is combed through\n- do this at least twice to help ensure you haven&#8217;t missed any areas\n- continue until you find no more lice\nIf you find head lice, you should check the rest of your family. Treat everyone found to have head lice on the same day.\nTo use the dry detection method:\n- use an ordinary, wide-toothed comb to straighten and untangle the hair\n- once the comb moves freely through the hair without dragging, switch to the louse detection comb\n- make sure the teeth of the comb slot into the hair at the roots, with the edge of the teeth lightly touching the scalp\n- draw the comb down from the crown to the ends of the hair with every stroke\n- look for lice as the comb is drawn through the hair. If you see a louse, trap it against the face of the comb with your thumb to stop if being repelled by static electricity\n- comb each section of hair 3 or 4 times before moving on to the next section\n- continue until the whole head has been combed through\nTreatments to get rid of head lice are available to buy from pharmacies, supermarkets and online.\nThe main treatments are:\n- lotions and sprays\n- wet combing\nEveryone with head lice in your household should be treated on the same day.\nIf a treatment doesn&#8217;t work the first time, you can:\n- try it again\n- try a different treatment\n- get advice from your school nurse, health visitor, pharmacist or GP\nThere are several different products that can be applied to the scalp and hair to kill head lice, including:\n- dimeticone 4% lotion or lotion spray – applied and left for 8 hours (usually overnight)\n- dimeticone 4% spray gel – applied and left for 15 minutes\n- mineral oil and dimeticone spray – applied and left for 15 minutes\n- isopropyl myristate and cyclomethicone solution – applied and left for 5-10 minutes\nSome treatments need to be done twice – 7 days apart. This makes sure that any newly-hatched lice are killed.\nDetection combing should usually be done 2 or 3 days after finishing treatment, and again another 7 days after that, to check for any live head lice.\nAlways check the pack or leaflet to see if a product is suitable for you, particularly if:\n- you&#8217;re pregnant\n- you&#8217;re breastfeeding\n- your child has head lice and is less than 2 years of age\nYour pharmacist can recommend a suitable treatment and advise you on how to use it correctly if necessary.\nYour pharmacist can advise you about treatments for head lice and nits if you&#8217;re not sure which is best for you or your child.\nMake sure you carefully follow the instructions that come with the treatment you choose.\nYou can get advice and treatment on head lice and nits directly from a pharmacy.\nHead lice are spread by direct head to head contact. They climb from one person&#8217;s hair to another&#8217;s.\nHead lice:\n- can&#8217;t fly, jump or swim\n- are very unlikely to be spread by objects like hats, combs and pillows\n- don&#8217;t have a preference for dirty, clean, short or long hair\n- only affect people\n- can&#8217;t be caught from animals\nOnce detached from the hair, head lice will usually die within 12 to 24 hours.\nIt&#8217;s very difficult to prevent head lice.\nYou may want to consider regular detection combing if you&#8217;re concerned about your children or yourself. For example, on a weekly basis.\nLotions and sprays don&#8217;t prevent head lice and should only be used if a live louse has been found in your or your child&#8217;s hair.\nStaying off work or school and washing clothing and bedding on a hot wash is unnecessary, as it&#8217;s unlikely to help prevent the spread of head lice."

There are 2 main types of hearing loss, depending on where the problem lies:\n- sensorineural hearing loss – caused by damage to the sensitive hair cells inside the inner ear or damage to the auditory nerve, which can happen naturally with age or as a result of injury\n- conductive hearing loss – when sounds are unable to pass from your outer ear to your inner ear, often because of a blockage such as earwax, glue ear or a build-up of fluid from an ear infection, perforated ear drum or disorder of the hearing bones\nIt’s also possible to have both these types of hearing loss. This is known as mixed hearing loss.\nSome people are born with hearing loss, but most cases develop as you get older.\nThe way hearing loss is treated depends on the cause and how severe it is.\nIn cases of sensorineural (nerve) hearing loss, there are several options that may help to improve a person’s ability to hear and communicate. These include:\n- digital hearing aids – which are available through the NHS\n- bone anchored implants – suitable for people who are unable to use hearing aids and for some levels of sensorineural hearing loss\n- middle ear implants – suitable for some people who are unable to use hearing aids\n- cochlear implants – for people who find hearing aids aren’t powerful enough\n- lip reading and/or sign language – such as British Sign Language (BSL)\nConductive hearing loss is sometimes temporary and can be treated with medication or minor surgery, if necessary. However, more major surgery may be required to fix the ear drum or hearing bones.\nIt isn’t always possible to prevent hearing loss if you have an underlying condition that causes you to lose your hearing.\nHowever, there are several things you can do to reduce the risk of hearing loss from long-term exposure to loud noise.\nIt’s possible to reduce your risk of noise-induced hearing loss (hearing loss from loud noise).\nYou should also speak to your GP practice if you have signs of an ear infection, such as flu-like symptoms, severe earache, discharge or hearing loss.\n"

        "disease": "Heart attack",
        "description": "You or someone else has symptoms like:\nA heart attack happens when there&#8217;s a reduction in blood supply to part of the heart muscle. This lack of blood flow can cause damage to the heart.\nSometimes, when chest pain occurs suddenly, it&#8217;s unclear if it&#8217;s due to unstable angina or a heart attack. Until tests confirm the diagnosis, doctors sometimes call this Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS).\nIn order to find out if you&#8217;re having a heart attack, you&#8217;ll need to have some tests. These tests can include:\n- an electrocardiogram (ECG) &#8211; to check your heart&#8217;s rhythm and electrical activity\n- blood tests &#8211; to check troponin levels, a protein that&#8217;s released into the blood stream when the heart muscle is damaged\n- an assessment of blood pressure\n- an assessment of blood oxygen levels\n- a chest X-ray\n- an echocardiogram &#8211; to assess the structure and function of your heart\n- a coronary angiogram &#8211; to identify any blood vessels that are narrowed or blocked\nBased on your test results, your clinical team will decide your treatment plan.\nWhen someone has a heart attack, it&#8217;s important to restore blood flow quickly. This&#8217;ll minimise damage to the heart muscle and start to alleviate symptoms.\nYour treatment plan will depend on:\n- the type of heart attack you’ve had\n- your individual situation\nTreatment for a heart attack may consist of:\n- anti-emetics &#8211; to stop sickness and nausea\n- antiplatelet therapy &#8211; medication that thins the blood and gets rid of blood clots\n- coronary angioplasty &#8211; a procedure to widen coronary arteries that are blocked or narrow\n- oxygen therapy &#8211; to help with your breathing and oxygen levels\n- pain-relieving drugs &#8211; like morphine\n- reperfusion treatment &#8211; to help restore blood flow and maintain the heart&#8217;s pumping action\n- thrombolysis &#8211; a ‘clot-busting drug’ to help restore blood flow to your heart\nPeople who&#8217;ve had a heart attack will need to take several different types of medication. Your doctor will try to find the best drugs for you with the fewest side effects.\nSometimes there are complications following a heart attack. The most common complications after a heart attack are:\n- arrhythmias &#8211; problems with your heart’s natural electrical rhythm\n- heart failure &#8211; when the heart isn&#8217;t pumping blood around the body as well as it should\nMany problems resolve themselves quite quickly. However, sometimes problems linger and can often be helped by medication.\nHow long you stay in hospital will depend upon your circumstances and treatment. Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask your medical team about what&#8217;s happening.\nOn discharge, you should be referred onto a cardiac rehabilitation programme.\nYou should receive an assessment to determine your individual goals and needs after a heart attack.\nRehabilitation is usually a mix of exercise and education sessions. This helps to provide you with the information, advice and support to:\n- understand your condition and medication\n- recover from your heart attack, procedure or surgery\n- make lifestyle changes to improve your heart health\nYour cardiac rehabilitation team can also give you advice on practical issues after a heart attack, including:\n- driving\n- mental wellbeing\n- relationships\n- sexual relationships\n- returning to work\n- long term recovery\nThe British Heart Foundation has further information on cardiac rehabilitation."

        "disease": "Heart block",
        "description": "A heart block is when the electrical impulses that control the beating of the heart muscle are disrupted. The most serious type of heart block known as a complete, or third degree, heart block will have symptoms, but often those with less serious heart block can have symptoms too.\nSymptoms can include:\n- shortness of breath\n- palpitations (irregular heartbeat)\n- dizzy spells/fainting\n- nausea\nWhen the heart beats,&nbsp;the heart muscle contracts (pulls inwards) in order to pump blood around the body. The contractions are triggered by electrical impulses that are generated by a selection of specialised cells that are known as the sinoatrial node (SA node).\nThe SA node is often referred to as a natural pacemaker because, like artificial pacemakers, it generates a series of electrical impulses at regular intervals.\nThe impulse is then sent to another selection of cells that are known as the atrioventricular node (AV node). The AV node conducts the impulse into the two lower chambers of the heart (the ventricles).\nA heart block occurs if the transmission of the impulse between the AV node and the ventricles is interrupted.\nA heart block does not mean that the heart stops beating altogether, because other ‘back-up’ systems can take over. However, it can result in an abnormally slow heartbeat (bradycardia), leading to the body’s organs and tissue becoming deprived of oxygen.\nThere are three main types of heart block:\n- first degree heart block\n- second degree heart block\n- third degree heart block\nThese are described in more detail below.\nA first degree heart block is where there is split-second delay in the time that it takes electrical pulses to move through the AV node. First degree heart block does not usually cause any noticeable symptoms and treatment is rarely required.\nA second degree heart block is where there is a series of increasing delays in the time that it takes the AV node to send the pulse to the ventricle, until eventually a heartbeat is skipped.\nThere are two sub-types of second degree heart block:\n- Mobitz type 1 &#8211; this is the least serious type of second degree heart block &#8211;&nbsp;it may occasionally cause symptoms of mild dizziness and does not usually require treatment\n- Mobitz type 2 &#8211; this is a more serious type of second degree heart block &#8211; it may cause symptoms of light headedness, dizziness and fainting in some people and usually requires treatment\nA third degree, or complete, heart block is where there is no transmission of electrical pulses between the AV node and the ventricles. As with second degree heart block, there are two sub-types of third degree heart block:\n- congenital &#8211; where the condition is present at birth\n- acquired &#8211; where the condition develops as a result of heart damage\nA third degree heart block can cause a wide range of symptoms, some of which are life-threatening. This type of heart block is usually regarded as a medical emergency and may require immediate treatment with a&nbsp;pacemaker (an artificial electrical device that is used to regulate heartbeats).\nRead more about&nbsp;pacemakers&nbsp;\nFirst degree and Mobitz type 1 heart blocks are uncommon but not rare. It is estimated that 0.5-2% of otherwise healthy adults have these types of heart blocks.\nMobitz type 2 heart block is rare in the general population, but it is more common in people with certain heart conditions. For example, it is estimated that 1 in 30 people with&nbsp;heart failure will develop Mobitz type 2 heart block.\nCongenital third degree heart blocks are rare, occurring in 1 in every 20,000 births. Conversely, acquired third degree heart block is a common complication of heart disease, particularly in older people. It is estimated that 5-10% of people who are over 70 years of age, and have a history of heart disease, will develop a third degree heart block.\nThe outlook for all types of heart block is very good as long as appropriate treatment is given as and when it is required.\nThe most serious types of heart block respond very well to treatment with a pacemaker, and deaths that are caused by these conditions are very rare.\nFirst degree heart block does not always cause any noticeable symptoms, and most people only become aware they have the condition when they are tested for an unrelated medical condition.\nMost people with second degree Mobitz type 1 heart block will not experience any symptoms. However, some people may experience symptoms such as:\n- light-headedness\n- dizziness\n- fainting (temporary loss of consciousness)\nPeople with second degree Mobitz type 2 heart blocks are much more likely to experience the symptoms listed above. They may also experience additional symptoms such as:\n- chest pain &#8211; which may be worse during physical activity, such as climbing the stairs\n- shortness of breath\n- tiring easily when undertaking physical activity\n- feeling very dizzy suddenly when standing up from a lying or sitting position &#8211; this is caused by having low blood pressure (hypotension)\nMany cases of congenital third degree heart block are diagnosed during pregnancy because an ultrasound scan can often detect whether the baby has a slow heartbeat (bradycardia).\nIf the diagnosis is overlooked during pregnancy, the symptoms of congenital third degree heart block will not usually become apparent until the child is older and a greater demand is placed on their heart.\nSymptoms of congenital third degree heart block in older infants or young children include:\n- unusually pale and blotchy skin\n- lethargy (lacking in energy)\n- unwillingness to take part in exercise or physical activity\n- dizziness\n- fainting\nSymptoms of acquired third degree heart block include:\n- light-headedness\n- dizziness\n- fainting\n- fatigue\n- chest pain\n- slow heart beat (bradycardia)\nIt may sound contradictory, but being very fit is one of the most common causes of first degree heart block. For example, the condition is widespread among elite long distance runners.\nThis is because vigorous and prolonged exercise can enlarge the heart muscles, causing mild disruption to the electrical signals of the heart.\nOther causes of first degree heart block include:\n- myocarditis &#8211; inflammation of the heart muscle\n- low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalaemia)\n- low levels of magnesium in the blood (hypomagnesemia)\nCertain medications can also cause first degree heart block including:\n- medications that are used to treat abnormal heart rhythms (antiarrhythmics), such as disopyramide\n- medications that are used to treat high blood pressure, such as calcium channel blockers and beta blockers\n- digoxin &#8211; a medication that is used to treat heart failure\nAs with first degree heart block, it is possible for athletes to develop second degree heart block for the reasons discussed above.\nSome children who are born with&nbsp;congenital heart disease (heart defects that are present at birth) can also develop second degree heart block.\nOther causes of second degree heart block include:\n- damage that develops during a heart attack\n- Lyme disease&nbsp;&#8211; a bacterial infection that is spread by tics\n- certain medications, such as calcium-channel blockers and&nbsp;beta blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), amiodarone (used to treat abnormal heart rhythms) and pentamidine (used to treat some types of pneumonia)\nA large proportion of congenital third degree heart block cases develop in mothers who have an autoimmune condition, such as&nbsp;lupus (a long-term condition that causes inflammation in the body&#8217;s tissues).\nAn autoimmune condition is where the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells and tissue. It is thought that the immune system mistakes the unborn baby for a foreign object (such as a virus) and sends antibodies to attack it. The antibodies cause damage to the heart.\nSome children with congenital heart disease will also be born with third degree heart block.\nMany cases of third degree heart block are caused by damage to the muscles of the heart. The heart muscle can become damaged for a number of reasons including:\n- as a complication of heart surgery &#8211; which is thought to be one of the most common causes\n- coronary heart disease&nbsp;&#8211; a condition where the heart does not receive enough blood\n- as a complication of&nbsp;radiotherapy (a treatment for conditions such as cancer, thyroid disorders and some blood disorders)\n- as a result of a serious infection, such as&nbsp;diphtheria (a bacterial infection that can cause inflammation of the heart) or&nbsp;rheumatic fever (a bacterial infection that damages the valves of the heart)\n- poorly controlled&nbsp;high blood pressure (hypertension)\n- cancer that spread from another part of the body into the heart\n- a penetrating trauma to the chest, such as a stab wound or gunshot wound\nA number of medications can also cause third degree heart block including:\n- digoxin – used to slow and steady a rapid heartbeat\n- calcium-channel blockers &#8211; used to treat high blood pressure\n- beta blockers &#8211; used to treat high blood pressure\n- tricyclic antidepressants &#8211; an older type of&nbsp;antidepressant\n- clonidine &#8211; used to treat a sudden, sharp rise in blood pressure (hypertensive crisis)\nFirst degree heart block does not usually require a medical diagnosis. However, an exception may be made if it is thought that the condition is the result of low potassium or magnesium levels. In such circumstances, blood tests may be used the check your potassium and magnesium levels.\nBlood tests are usually recommended to check that your heart block is not the result of an infection such as Lyme disease, or high levels of certain medication.\nYou may also be referred for an electrocardiogram (ECG). An ECG is a test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. It may be carried out while you are exercising (usually on a treadmill or an exercise bike) or while you are resting.\nAn ECG can provide a useful overall assessment of how well your heart is working. In some cases, it may also be able to determine whether you have a Mobitz type 1, or type 2, heart block.\nCongenital third degree heart block may be detected during pregnancy using an&nbsp;ultrasound scan. The scanner can be used to measure how quickly your baby’s heart is beating. An abnormally slow heartbeat may signify a heart block.\nCongenital third degree heart block can usually be confirmed before or after birth using an echocardiogram. An echocardiogram is a type of ultrasound scanner that is specifically designed to assess how well your heart is pumping.\nAcquired third degree heart block is usually diagnosed using a combination of blood tests and an ECG. In some cases, an echocardiogram may also be performed if it is thought that there is inflammation affecting the heart muscles.\nDue to the often critical nature of third degree heart block, treatment may begin before the results of all of the blood tests are known.\nTreatment is usually only required when a heart block is causing symptoms (symptomatic). This will usually be in cases of:\n- Mobitz type 2 second degree heart block\n- third degree heart block\nDue to the potentially serious nature of symptomatic heart block, you will usually be taken immediately to the nearest hospital.\nTranscutaneous pacing (TCP) is the treatment of choice for symptomatic heart block. TCP is a way of restoring your normal heartbeat.\nDuring TCP, pads will be applied to your chest. Electrical pulses will then be delivered through the pads and these pulses will be used to correct your heartbeat.\nTCP can feel uncomfortable so you may be sedated before the procedure begins. If you are sedated, you will be given medication to make you feel drowsy so that you have little or no awareness of what is going on around you.\nOnce your heartbeat has been stabilised, a permanent pacemaker may be recommended.\nA&nbsp;pacemaker is a small electrical device that is similar to a battery and can be inserted into one of your veins before being moved next to your heart.\nThe pacemaker has wires that are inserted into your heart and will generate a regular series of pulses to keep your heart beating.\nHaving a pacemaker&nbsp;fitted"

Most people get better within a couple of months.\nA hepatitis A vaccine is available on the NHS if you&#8217;re at increased risk.\nSome people with hepatitis A, particularly young children, won&#8217;t have any symptoms.\nIf you do develop symptoms, they tend to occur around 4 weeks after exposure to the hepatitis A virus.\nSymptoms of hepatitis A include:\n- feeling tired and generally unwell\n- joint and muscle pain\n- a high temperature (fever)\n- loss of appetite\n- feeling or being sick\n- pain in the upper-right part of your tummy\n- a headache, sore throat and cough\n- constipation or diarrhoea\n- a raised, itchy rash (hives)\n- yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice)\n- dark pee\n- pale poo\n- itchy skin\n- the upper-right part of your tummy becoming swollen and tender\nA blood test can check whether you have hepatitis A. It can also rule out other conditions that cause similar symptoms, but which may require treatment to prevent more serious problems.\nYour friends, family and sexual partners may need to be tested too.\nThere’s currently no cure for hepatitis A. It will usually get better its own within a couple of months.\nOnce hepatitis A passes, you&#8217;ll normally be immune to it for life.\nThere are things you can do to help your symptoms and prevent the infection spreading to others.\nSpeak to your GP practice if your symptoms get worse or haven’t started to improve within a couple of months. They can prescribe medications to help with itchiness, nausea or vomiting, if needed.\nHepatitis A can occasionally last for many months.\nIn rare cases, it can be life-threatening if it causes liver failure. People most at risk include those with other liver problems and elderly people. If liver failure does occur, a liver transplant is usually needed to treat it.\nHepatitis A is most widespread in parts of the world where standards of cleanliness and food hygiene are poor.\nYou can get the infection from:\n- drinking unclean water\n- eating food that&#8217;s been washed or grown in unclean water\n- eating food that&#8217;s been handled by an infected person\n- close contact with someone who has hepatitis A\n- having sex with someone who has the infection – particularly if you touch their anus with your fingers, mouth or tongue\n- injecting drugs using unclean equipment\nSomeone with hepatitis A is most infectious from around 2 weeks before their symptoms appear until about 1 week after the symptoms first develop.\nVaccination is the best way to prevent hepatitis A.\nThe hepatitis A vaccine isn’t routinely offered in the UK because the risk of infection is low for most people.\nIt’s only recommended for people at increased risk, including:\n- close contacts of someone with hepatitis A\n- people planning to travel to or live in parts of the world where hepatitis A is widespread, particularly if levels of cleanliness and food hygiene are expected to be poor\n- people with any type of long-term (chronic) liver disease\n- men who have sex with other men\n- people who inject illegal drugs\n- people who may be exposed to hepatitis A through their job – for example sewage workers, staff at homeless shelters, and people working with monkeys, apes and gorillas"

        "description": "Hepatitis B is a liver infection that’s spread through blood and body fluids. The chance of getting it in the UK is low.\nIt often doesn’t cause any symptoms in adults and usually passes in a few months without treatment. In children it often persists for years and may eventually cause serious liver damage.\nA hepatitis B vaccine is available on the NHS as part of routine child vaccination, or if you&#8217;re at high risk.\nMany people with hepatitis B won’t have any symptoms.\nIf you do develop symptoms, they tend to occur 2 or 3 months after exposure to the hepatitis B virus.\nSymptoms of hepatitis B include:\n- tiredness\n- a high temperature (fever) of 38°C (100.4°F) or above\n- general aches and pains\n- loss of appetite\n- feeling and being sick\n- diarrhoea\n- abdominal pain\n- yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice)\nA blood test can check if you have hepatitis B or have had it in the past. The hepatitis B vaccine may also be recommended to reduce your risk of infection.\nTreatment for hepatitis B depends on how long you’ve been infected for.\nIf you’ve been exposed to the virus in the last few days, emergency treatment can help stop you becoming infected.\nAcute hepatitis B means you’ve only had the infection for a few weeks or months. You may only need treatment to relieve your symptoms while your body fights off the infection itself.\nChronic hepatitis B means you’ve had the infection for more than 6 months. You may be offered medicines that can keep the virus under control and reduce the risk of liver damage.\nChronic hepatitis B often requires:\n- long-term or lifelong treatment\n- regular checks for any further liver problems\nThe hepatitis B virus is found in the blood, semen and vaginal fluids and bodily fluids of an infected person.\nIt can be spread by:\n- a mother to her newborn baby, particularly in countries where the infection is common\n- within families (child to child) in countries where the infection is common\n- injecting drugs and sharing needles and other drug equipment, such as spoons and filters\n- having sex with an infected person without using a condom\n- having a tattoo, body piercing, or medical or dental treatment with unsterilised equipment\n- sharing toothbrushes, razors or scissors contaminated with infected blood\nHepatitis B is not spread by kissing, holding hands, hugging, coughing, sneezing, or sharing crockery and utensils.\nA vaccine that offers protection against hepatitis B is available for all babies born in the UK on or after 1 August 2017. It&#8217;s also available for people at high risk of the infection or complications from it.\nPeople at high risk of hepatitis B include:\n- babies born to mothers with hepatitis B\n- close family and sexual partners of someone with hepatitis B\n- people travelling to a part of the world where hepatitis B is widespread\n- families adopting or fostering children from high-risk countries\n- people who inject drugs or have a sexual partner who injects drugs\n- people who change their sexual partner often\n- men who have sex with men\n- male and female sex workers\n- people whose job puts them at risk of contact with blood or body fluids, such as nurses, prison staff, doctors, dentists and laboratory staff\n- people with chronic liver disease\n- people with chronic kidney disease\n- people in prison\n- people receiving regular blood or blood products, and their carers\nNHS Scotland is making the blood supply safer by introducing enhanced hepatitis B screening. This is an additional measure to improve testing for blood donors and further increase the safety of the blood supply chain.\nNHS Scotland has been conducting this enhanced screening on all donations since April 2022. Only a small number of donors are impacted, however, these donors will no longer be able to donate.\nAs well as medical treatments, there are some things you can do when you have hepatitis B to help ease the symptoms and stop the infection spreading to others.\nYour close contacts, such as family members, may need to be vaccinated.\nMost people do not have any lasting problems after having a hepatitis B infection.\nIn some patients chronic hepatitis B can cause liver damage (cirrhosis) and increase your risk of getting liver cancer.\nIt is important that all patients with chronic hepatitis B are followed up in specialist clinics. If required, treatment can control hepatitis B infection, preventing serious complications."

        "disease": "Hepatitis C",
        "description": "Hepatitis C is a liver infection that&#8217;s spread through blood.\nIt can be cured with treatment. But if left untreated, it can sometimes cause serious and potentially life-threatening damage to the liver over many years.\nMany people with hepatitis C won’t have any symptoms until the liver has been significantly damaged. This means many people have the infection without knowing.\nMost people will not have symptoms during the first 6 months of a hepatitis C infection. This stage is known as acute hepatitis C.\nIf symptoms do develop, they usually occur a few weeks after infection.\nEarly symptoms may include:\n- a high temperature (fever) of 38°C (100.4°F) or above\n- tiredness\n- loss of appetite\n- abdominal pain\n- feeling and being sick\n- yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice)\nSymptoms can vary from person to person. They can also go away for long periods of time and then return.\nLater symptoms may include:\n- feeling tired all the time\n- joint and muscle aches and pain\n- feeling sick\n- brain fog – including problems with memory, concentration and mental tasks such as arithmetic\n- mood swings\n- depression or anxiety\n- indigestion or bloating\n- itchy skin\n- abdominal pain\nThe only way to know for certain if these symptoms are caused by hepatitis C is to get tested.\nYou can get tested for hepatitis C at:\n- your GP practice\n- a sexual health clinic\n- a drug treatment service\n- most substance use recovery services\nTreatment takes 8 to 12 weeks, and usually cures the infection. But you won&#8217;t be immune to hepatitis C. So you should take steps to reduce your risk of becoming infected again.\nIf the infection is diagnosed early (acute hepatitis), you may not need treatment straight away. Instead, you may have another blood test after a few months to see if your body fights off the virus itself.\nIf the infection continues for several months (chronic hepatitis), treatment will usually be recommended.\nThere are things you can do to stop liver damage and prevent the infection spreading to others before you start treatment.\nYou can become infected with hepatitis C if you come into contact with the blood of an infected person.\nSome ways the infection can be spread include:\n- injecting drugs and sharing needles and other drug equipment, such as spoons and filters\n- sharing toothbrushes, razors or scissors contaminated with infected blood\n- from a pregnant woman to her unborn baby\n- having sex with an infected person without using a condom – if your partner has hepatitis C, you should be tested\n- having a tattoo, body piercing, or medical or dental treatment with unsterilised equipment\n- if you had a blood transfusion in Scotland before 1996, you may have been exposed to hepatitis C – all donor blood in Scotland has been screened for hepatitis C since September 1991, however there is an extremely small possibility that some infections may have occurred from blood transfusions after universal screening was introduced but before a reporting system for transfusion risks began in 1996\nThere’s no vaccine for hepatitis C.\nThere are things you can do to reduce your risk of becoming infected.\nThe risk of getting hepatitis C through vaginal sex is very low. It may be higher if blood is present, such as period (menstrual) blood or from bleeding during anal sex.\nIf left untreated for many years, hepatitis C can cause liver damage (cirrhosis). In severe cases, life-threatening problems such as liver failure or liver cancer can eventually develop.\nEarly treatment of hepatitis C prevents these serious complications, while later treatment reduces the risk."

        "disease": "Hiatus hernia",
        "description": "A hiatus hernia, or hiatal hernia, is when part of the stomach squeezes up into the chest through an opening (&#8216;hiatus&#8217;) in the diaphragm.\nThe diaphragm is a large, thin sheet of muscle&nbsp;between the chest&nbsp;and the abdomen (tummy).\nA hiatus hernia itself rarely&nbsp;has any noticeable symptoms. However, it can cause a problem called&nbsp;gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD).\nGORD is where stomach acid leaks into the oesophagus (the tube that carries food to the stomach). It can occur if a hiatus hernia prevents the valve at the bottom of the oesophagus from working properly.\nYour oesophagus can become&nbsp;severely irritated, because it&#8217;s not protected against stomach acid. This can cause symptoms such as heartburn, chest pain, an unpleasant sour&nbsp;taste in your mouth, and swallowing problems (dysphagia).\nYou should see your GP if you have frequent and severe symptoms of GORD.\nIt&#8217;s not exactly clear what causes hiatus hernia, but it may be the result of the diaphragm becoming weak with age, or pressure on the abdomen.\nHiatus hernia can sometimes occur in newborn babies if the stomach or diaphragm doesn&#8217;t develop properly.\nHiatus hernia can affect anyone, but it&#8217;s more common in people who are:\n- over 50 years of age\n- overweight\n- pregnant\nIt&#8217;s estimated that a third of people over 50 have a hiatus hernia.\nThere&#8217;s also a&nbsp;rare type of hiatus hernia that affects newborn babies, which&nbsp;is caused by a congenital defect of the stomach or diaphragm. Congenital means that it is present from birth.\nThere are 2&nbsp;main types of hiatus hernia. They are:\n- sliding hiatus hernias – hernias that&nbsp;move up and down, in and out of the chest area (more than 80% of hiatus hernias are of this type)\n- para-oesophageal hiatus hernias – also called rolling hiatus hernias, where part of the stomach pushes up through the hole in the diaphragm next to the oesophagus (about 5 to 15% of hiatus hernias are of this type)\nThese pages&nbsp;mainly focus on sliding hiatus hernias. They can usually be diagnosed using an&nbsp;X-ray or an endoscopy, where a long, thin flexible tube with a light and video camera at one end is used to examine the inside of the body.\nRead more about diagnosing a hiatus hernia.\nTreatment for a sliding hiatus hernia&nbsp;usually focuses on relieving the symptoms of GORD, such as heartburn.\nLifestyle changes and medication are the preferred treatments. Surgery is usually only recommended as an alternative to long-term medication or if other treatments haven&#8217;t worked.\nLifestyle advice&nbsp;may include:\n- eating smaller, more frequent meals, rather than 3&nbsp;large meals a day\n- avoiding lying down (including going to bed) for 3&nbsp;hours after eating or drinking\n- removing any foods or drinks&nbsp;from your diet&nbsp;that make your symptoms worse &nbsp;\nIf a hiatus hernia isn&#8217;t causing any noticeable problems, it doesn&#8217;t usually need to be treated.\nSurgery is used to repair a para-oesophageal hiatus hernia if there&#8217;s a&nbsp;risk of serious complications.\nRead more about treating a hiatus hernia.\nIt&#8217;s rare for a hiatus hernia to cause complications,&nbsp;but long-term damage&nbsp;to the oesophagus&nbsp;caused by&nbsp;leaking stomach acid can lead to&nbsp;ulcers, scarring and changes to the cells of the oesophagus,&nbsp;which can increase your risk of oesophageal cancer.\nRead more about the complications of a hiatus hernia.\nA hiatus hernia can usually be diagnosed after a gastroscopy or X-ray.\nA&nbsp;gastroscopy&nbsp;is a procedure where the&nbsp;inside of your body is examined using a gastroscope&nbsp;(a long, thin flexible tube with a light and video camera at one end), which sends images to an external monitor.\nThe gastroscope will be inserted into your mouth and down your throat, and will be used to help identify any problems. The procedure may be carried out using a local anaesthetic or a sedative to help you relax.\nThe barium meal X-ray, also called the barium swallow test, is an effective way of identifying a hiatus hernia.\nAs part of the test, you&#8217;ll be asked to drink some barium solution. Barium is a non-toxic chemical&nbsp;that shows up clearly on an&nbsp;X-ray. Once the barium moves down into your digestive system, a series of X-rays will be taken to identify any problems.\nIf you need to have a barium meal X-ray, you won&#8217;t be able to eat or drink anything for at least 6&nbsp;hours before the procedure, so that your stomach and duodenum (the top of the small intestine) are empty. You may be given an injection to relax the muscles in your digestive system.\nYou&#8217;ll be given a white, chalky liquid containing barium to drink while lying down. This will allow the specialist to see your stomach on an X-ray monitor more easily, as well as any ulcers or abnormal growths. Your&nbsp;bed may be tipped slightly during the test, so that the barium fills all the areas of your stomach.\nA barium swallow usually takes about 15 minutes to perform. Afterwards, you&#8217;ll be able to eat and drink as normal, although you may need to drink more water to help flush the barium out of your system.\nYou may feel slightly sick after a barium meal X-ray and the barium may cause constipation. Your stools may also be white for a few days afterwards, as the barium passes through your system.\nTreatment for a hiatus hernia is usually only necessary if it&#8217;s causing problems.\nIn most cases, people with a hiatus hernia only experience problems if the hernia causes&nbsp;gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). GORD can cause symptoms such as heartburn and an unpleasant taste in your mouth.\nLifestyle changes and medication are the preferred treatments, although surgery may be used as an alternative to long-term medication, or if other treatments are ineffective.\nThere are several things you can do yourself to help relieve&nbsp;symptoms of GORD caused by a hiatus hernia. These include:\n- eating smaller, more frequent meals, rather than three large meals a day\n- avoiding lying down (including going to bed) for at least 3&nbsp;hours after&nbsp;eating or drinking\n- avoiding drinking during the night\n- removing certain&nbsp;foods&nbsp;from your diet if you think they make your symptoms worse\n- avoiding alcohol, caffeine, chocolate, tomatoes, fatty foods, spicy foods and acidic food&nbsp;or drinks, such as citrus fruit juice, if they make your symptoms worse\n- avoiding bending over or stooping, particularly after eating or drinking\n- raising the head of your bed by around 20cm (8 inches) by placing a piece of wood or blocks under it; don&#8217;t use extra pillows, because this may increase pressure on your abdomen\nIf you&#8217;re overweight,&nbsp;losing weight may help to reduce the severity and frequency of your symptoms.\nIf you smoke, you should try to give up. Tobacco smoke can irritate your digestive system and may make your symptoms worse.\nRead about&nbsp;stopping smoking.\nA number of different medications can be used to treat symptoms of hiatus hernia. These are described below.\nAntacid medicines&nbsp;can relieve some of the symptoms of hiatus hernia.&nbsp;They come in liquid or tablet form and&nbsp;can be swallowed or chewed. They help to neutralise&nbsp;stomach acid when they reach the oesophagus and stomach by making it less acidic.\nHowever, antacid medicines don&#8217;t work for everyone. They&#8217;re not a long-term solution if symptoms persist or you&#8217;re in extreme discomfort.\nAntacids shouldn&#8217;t be taken at the same time as other medicines, because they can stop other medicines from being properly absorbed&nbsp;by your body. They may also damage the special coating on some types of tablets. Ask your GP or pharmacist for advice.\nAlginates are an alternative medicine to antacids. They work by producing a protective coating that shields the lining of your stomach and oesophagus from the effects of stomach acid.\nIn some cases,&nbsp;a medicine known as an H2-receptor antagonist (H2RA) may be recommended if a hiatus hernia is causing GORD. Examples of H2RAs include cimetidine,&nbsp;famotidine (PepcidTwo) and ranitidine.\nH2RAs block the effects of the chemical histamine, which&nbsp;your body&nbsp;uses to produce stomach acid. H2RAs therefore help to reduce the amount of acid in your stomach.\nSide effects of H2RAs are uncommon. However, possible side effects may include diarrhoea, headaches, tiredness&nbsp;and a&nbsp;rash.\nSome H2RAs are available over the counter at pharmacies. These types of HR2As are taken in a lower dosage than the ones available on prescription. Ask your GP or pharmacist if you&#8217;re not sure&nbsp;whether these medicines are suitable for you.\nYour GP may prescribe a medication called a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI). PPIs work by reducing the amount of acid produced by your stomach. Examples of the&nbsp;PPIs you may be prescribed include omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole and esomeprazole.\nMost people tolerate PPIs well and side effects are uncommon. When they do occur, they&#8217;re usually mild and can include headaches, diarrhoea, feeling sick or constipation.\nTo minimise any side effects, your GP will prescribe the lowest possible dose of PPIs they think will be effective. You should let your GP know if the prescribed dose of PPIs doesn&#8217;t work. A stronger dose may be needed.&nbsp;\nSurgery is usually only recommended for a sliding hiatus hernia (hernias that move up and down, in and out of the chest area)&nbsp;if the problem fails to respond to lifestyle changes and medication.\nYou may also want to consider surgery if you have persistent and troublesome symptoms, but don&#8217;t want to take medication on a long-term basis.\nPrior to surgery, you may need further investigations to check how well the oesophagus moves (manometry) and&nbsp;how much acid is being refluxed (24-hour oesopageal pH studies).\nA procedure called a laparoscopic nissen fundoplication (LNF) is one of the most common surgical techniques used to treat GORD and sliding hiatus hernias.\nLNF is a type of keyhole surgery that involves making a series of small cuts in your abdomen. Carbon dioxide gas is used to inflate your abdomen to give the surgeon room to work in.\nDuring LNF,&nbsp;the stomach is put back into the correct position and the diaphragm around the lower part of the oesophagus is tightened. This should prevent any acid moving back out of your stomach.\nLNF is carried out under general anaesthetic,&nbsp;so you won&#8217;t feel any pain or discomfort. The surgery takes 60 to 90 minutes to complete.\nAfter having LNF, you should be able to leave hospital after you&#8217;ve recovered from the effects of the general anaesthetic. This is usually within 2&nbsp;to 3&nbsp;days. Depending on the type of job you do, you should be able to return to work within 3&nbsp;to 6&nbsp;weeks.\nFor the first 6&nbsp;weeks after surgery, it&#8217;s recommended that you only eat soft food, such as mince, mashed potatoes or soup. Avoid eating hard food that could get stuck at the site of the surgery, such as toast, chicken or steak.\nCommon side effects of LNF include difficulties swallowing (dysphagia), belching, bloating and flatulence.\nThese side effects should resolve over the course of a few months. However, in about 1 in 100 cases they can be persistent. In such circumstances, further corrective surgery may be required.\nIf you have a&nbsp;para-oesophageal hiatus hernia, where the stomach pushes up through the hole in the diaphragm next to the oesophagus, surgery may be recommended to reduce the risk of the hernia becoming strangulated (see complications of a hiatus hernia for more information).\nComplications&nbsp;from a hiatus hernia are rare, but they can be serious.\nHiatus hernias that slide in and out of the chest area (sliding hiatus hernias) can cause gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). This is where stomach acid leaks into the oesophagus (gullet). This can damage the oesophagus, increasing the risk of problems.\nDamage to the lining of the&nbsp;oesophagus (oesophagitis) caused by stomach acid can lead to the formation of ulcers. The ulcers can bleed, causing pain and making swallowing difficult.\nUlcers can usually be successfully treated by controlling the underlying symptoms of GORD. In most cases, over-the-counter medicines called antacids&nbsp;or alginates are used to treat the condition.\nRead more about treating GORD.\nRepeated damage to the lining of your oesophagus can lead to the formation of scar tissue. If the scar tissue is allowed to build up, it can cause your oesophagus to become narrowed. This is known as oesophageal stricture.\nAn oesophageal stricture can make swallowing food difficult and painful. Oesophageal strictures can be treated using a tiny balloon to dilate (widen) the oesophagus. This procedure is usually carried out under a local anaesthetic.\nRepeated damage to the oesophagus can also lead to changes in the cells lining your lower oesophagus. This is a condition known as Barrett&#8217;s oesophagus.\nBarrett&#8217;s oesophagus doesn&#8217;t usually cause noticeable symptoms, other than those associated with GORD. However, Barrett&#8217;s oesophagus can increase&nbsp;your risk of developing oesophageal cancer.\nIf you have persistent reflux symptoms for more than 3&nbsp;weeks, you should talk to your GP because you may need some investigations.\nIn some cases, a hiatus hernia causes part of the stomach to push up next to the oesophagus. This is known as a para-oesophageal hiatus hernia. GORD doesn&#8217;t usually occur in these cases, but there&#8217;s a risk of the hernia becoming strangulated.\nStrangulation occurs when the hernia becomes knotted and the blood supply to the area is cut off. Emergency surgery is usually required to correct the problem."

The arteries are vessels that carry blood from the heart around the body.\nThere needs to be a certain level of pressure in the arteries to move blood around the body. But, if blood pressure is higher than recommended over time it increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases like stroke or heart attack. High blood pressure (or hypertension) is usually diagnosed if your blood pressure is regularly above 140/90 mmHg.\nYou may be more at risk from high blood pressure if you:\n- eat a high-fat diet\n- eat a high-salt diet\n- don&#8217;t exercise\n- are overweight\n- smoke\n- drink too much alcohol\n- are stressed\n- take some recreational drugs\n- are older – the risk of developing high blood pressure increases as you get older\n- have a family history of high blood pressure\n- are of Afro-Caribbean or South Asian origin\nFor some people, a cause of high blood pressure is found.

So, if you think you may have high blood pressure, or you&#8217;re on medication for it, you should check your blood pressure regularly.\nIn rare cases, high blood pressure may cause symptoms.\nYou have symptoms of very high blood pressure like:\nSome GP practices now will now provide you with a blood pressure monitor to take home. This is because:\n- your blood pressure can change throughout the day\n- anxiety or stress can raise your blood pressure\nA home blood pressure monitor can be used to measure your blood pressure levels over time. You can can use the monitor at a time that suits you.\nA healthcare professional may take blood and urine tests along with blood pressure checks. This is to check for conditions that can cause an increase in blood pressure like kidney disease.\nMaking lifestyle changes can sometimes help if you have high blood pressure.\nSometimes a combination of treatments is needed to treat high blood pressure. This means you may have to take more than one type of medication in addition to making healthy lifestyle changes.\nThe most common medications for high blood pressure are:\n- angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors – like ramipril\n- calcium channel blockers – like amlodipine\n- thiazide diuretics – like bendroflumethazide\n- alpha-blockers – like doxazosin\n- beta-blockers – like atenolol\nIf you have high blood pressure, you may have to take medication to treat it for the rest of your life. But, the effect of medication and your lifestyle on your blood pressure should be monitored over time.\nIf it&#8217;s left untreated, high blood pressure can cause problems including:\n- stroke\n- heart attack\n- arterial thrombosis\n- abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)\n- kidney disease\n- vascular dementia"

The body needs a certain amount of cholesterol to function normally.\nCholesterol combines with proteins to be carried around the blood. This combination is known as lipoproteins.\nThere are 2 main types of lipoprotein.\nHigh-density lipoprotein (HDL) carries cholesterol away from the cells and back to the liver to be removed. For this reason, HDL is referred to as &#8216;good cholesterol&#8217; and higher levels of this type are better.\nNon-HDL lipoproteins are known as &#8216;bad cholesterol&#8217;. This is because it can build up in blood vessel walls if there&#8217;s too much.\nNon-HDL lipoproteins can build up in blood vessel walls and cause&nbsp;atherosclerosis.

For example:\n- gay and bisexual men or men who have sex with men should have an HIV test at least once a year, or every 3 months if having sex without HIV PrEP or condoms with new or casual partners\n- women and men from countries with high HIV prevalence, especially from sub-Saharan Africa, should have an HIV test if having sex without using HIV PrEP or condoms with new or casual partners\n- people who inject drugs or have unprotected sex (sex without condoms or HIV PrEP) with people who inject drugs\nThe test for HIV is straightforward, highly accurate and is the only way to know if you&#8217;re infected. It involves taking a sample from the body for analysis.\nThere are 4 main types of HIV test.\nWhere a sample of blood is taken and sent to a lab for analysis. Results are usually available within a few days.\nA sample of saliva from your mouth or a small spot of blood from your finger is taken. This sample doesn’t need to be sent to a lab and the result is available within a few minutes. Anyone who has a reactive point of care test still needs a confirmed laboratory test.\nWhere you collect a saliva sample or small spot of blood at home and send it off in the post for analysis. You’ll be contacted by phone or text with your result in a few days. You can buy them online or from some pharmacies. Anyone who has a reactive home testing kit result is still required to have a laboratory confirmed test.\nWhere you collect a saliva sample or small spot of blood yourself and test it at home. The result is available within minutes. Check that any test you buy has a CE quality assurance mark and is licensed for sale in the UK.\nAntiretroviral medicines are used to treat HIV. They work by stopping the virus multiplying in the body, allowing the immune system to repair itself and prevent further damage.\nThese come in tablet form and must be taken every day.\nMost people with HIV take a combination of medicines.\nThe goal of HIV treatment is to have an undetectable viral load. This means the level of HIV virus in your body is low enough to not be detected by a test.\nPeople who take HIV treatment and whose virus level is undetectable can’t pass HIV on to others. Although there is no cure for HIV yet, people living with HIV who take their treatment should have a normal lifespan and good health.\nWithout treatment, people with HIV will eventually become unwell. HIV can be fatal if it’s not detected and treated in time to allow the immune system to repair. It’s extremely important to test for HIV if you think you’ve been exposed.\nYou can get HIV by having unprotected vaginal or anal sex (sex without a condom or not taking HIV PrEP). It may be possible for HIV to be passed on through unprotected oral sex, but the risk is very low.\nOther ways of getting HIV include:\n- sharing sex toys that aren&#8217;t washed or covered with a new condom each time they&#8217;re used\n- sharing needles, syringes and other injecting equipment\n- from mother to baby before or during birth when the mother isn&#8217;t taking HIV medication\n- from mother to baby by breastfeeding when the mother isn&#8217;t taking HIV medication\n- blood transfusion (outside of the UK)\nPeople who are at higher risk of becoming infected with HIV include people who are not taking HIV PrEP medication and who are:\n- men who have had unprotected anal sex with men\n- women who have had unprotected sex with men who have sex with men\n- people who have had unprotected sex with a person who has lived or travelled in a high HIV prevalence country\n- people who inject drugs\n- people who have had unprotected sex with somebody who has injected drugs\n- people who have caught another sexually transmitted infection (STI)\nThe best way to reduce your risk of STIs is to practice safer sex. This means using a condom for vaginal, anal and oral sex. If you&#8217;re having anal sex it’s important to also use water-based or silicon-based lubricant.\nTaking HIV PrEP before you&#8217;re exposed to HIV means there&#8217;s a drug inside of you to block HIV if it gets into your body, so it can&#8217;t infect you.\nIf you think you may have recently been exposed to HIV and you haven’t taken HIV PrEP medication or used a condom, you should take PEP medication.\nPEP is a form of emergency HIV medication taken by someone who does not have HIV but who has or may have been very recently exposed to HIV.\nPEP should be taken as soon as possible, but it can be taken up to 72 hours after exposure. The earlier it is taken the more effective it is.\nPEP is available from sexual health services or out of hours from A&amp;E.\nIf you inject drugs, you should never share needles or other injecting equipment (including syringes, spoons and swabs).\nYou can get free clean needles and other injecting equipment from your local injecting equipment providers, which are sometimes also called needle exchanges.\nIf you&#8217;ve been diagnosed with HIV you should get tested for all STIs and blood borne viruses including:\n- chlamydia\n- gonorrhoea\n- syphilis\n- hepatitis B\n- hepatitis C"

        "disease": "Hodgkin lymphoma",
        "description": "Hodgkin lymphoma is an uncommon cancer that develops in the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout your body.\nThe lymphatic system is part of your immune system. Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells, known as lymphocytes.\nIn Hodgkin lymphoma, B-lymphocytes (a particular type of lymphocyte) start to multiply in an abnormal way and begin to collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes (glands). The affected lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection.\nThe most common symptom of Hodgkin lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin.\nRead more about the symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma.\nHodgkin lymphoma&nbsp;can develop at any age, but it mostly affects young adults in their early 20s and older adults over the age of 70. Slightly more men than women are affected.\nThe exact cause of Hodgkin lymphoma is unknown. However, your risk of developing the condition is increased if:\n- you&nbsp;have a medical condition that weakens your immune system\n- you take immunosuppressant medication\n- you&#8217;ve previously been exposed to&nbsp;a common virus called the Epstein-Barr virus – which causes glandular fever\nYou also have an increased risk of developing Hodgkin lymphoma if a first-degree relative (parent, sibling or child) has had the condition.\nRead more about the causes of Hodgkin lymphoma.\nThe only way to confirm a diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma is by carrying out a&nbsp;biopsy.\nThis is a minor surgical procedure where&nbsp;a sample of affected lymph node tissue is removed and studied in a laboratory.\nRead more about diagnosing Hodgkin lymphoma.\nHodgkin lymphoma is a relatively aggressive cancer and can quickly spread through the body. Despite this, it&#8217;s also one of the most easily treated types of cancer.\nYour recommended treatment plan will depend on your general health and age, because many of the treatments can put a tremendous strain on the body.&nbsp;How far the cancer has spread is also an important factor in determining the best treatment.\nThe main treatments used are&nbsp;chemotherapy, followed by radiotherapy or chemotherapy alone. Surgery isn&#8217;t generally used as a treatment for the condition.\nRead more about:\n- treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma\n- complications of Hodgkin lymphoma\nThe most common symptom of Hodgkin lymphoma is a swelling in the neck, armpit or groin. The swelling is usually painless, although some people find that it aches.\nThe swelling is caused by an excess of affected lymphocytes (white blood cells) collecting in a lymph node (also called lymph glands). Lymph nodes are pea-sized lumps of tissue found throughout the body. They contain white blood cells that help to fight infection.\nHowever, it&#8217;s highly unlikely that you have Hodgkin lymphoma if you have swollen lymph nodes, as these glands often swell&nbsp;as a response to infection.\nSome people with Hodgkin lymphoma also have other more general symptoms. These can include:\n- night sweats\n- unintentional weight loss\n- a high temperature (fever)\n- a persistent&nbsp;cough or feeling of breathlessness\n- persistent itching of the skin all over the body\nOther symptoms will depend on where in the body the enlarged lymph glands are. For example, if the abdomen (tummy) is affected, you may have abdominal pain or indigestion\nA few people with lymphoma have abnormal cells in their bone marrow when they&#8217;re diagnosed. This&nbsp;may lead to:\n- persistent tiredness or fatigue\n- an increased risk of infections\n- excessive bleeding – such as nosebleeds,&nbsp;heavy periods and spots of blood under the skin\nIn&nbsp;some cases, people with Hodgkin lymphoma experience pain in their&nbsp;lymph glands when they drink alcohol.\nSpeak to your GP if you&nbsp;have any of these symptoms, particularly if you have persistently swollen glands with no other signs of infection.\nWhile the symptoms are unlikely to be caused by Hodgkin lymphoma, it is best to get them checked out.\nHodgkin lymphoma is caused by a change (mutation) in the DNA of a type of white blood cell called B lymphocytes, although the exact reason why this happens isn&#8217;t known.\nThe DNA gives the cells a basic set of instructions, such as when to grow and reproduce. The mutation in the DNA changes these instructions so the cells keep growing, causing them to multiply uncontrollably.\nThe abnormal lymphocytes usually begin to multiply in one or more lymph nodes in a particular area of the body, such as your neck or groin. Over time, it&#8217;s possible for the abnormal lymphocytes to spread into other parts of your body, such as your:\n- bone marrow\n- spleen\n- liver\n- skin\n- lungs\nWhile the&nbsp;cause of the initial mutation that triggers Hodgkin lymphoma is unknown, a number of factors can increase your risk of developing the condition. These include:\n- having a medical condition that weakens your immune system, such as HIV\n- having medical treatment that weakens your immune system – for example, taking medication to suppress your immune system after&nbsp;an organ transplant\n- being previously exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) –&nbsp;a common virus that causes glandular fever\n- having previously had&nbsp;non-Hodgkin lymphoma, possibly because of treatment with&nbsp;chemotherapy&nbsp;or radiotherapy\n- being very overweight (obese)&nbsp;–&nbsp;this may be more of a risk factor in women than men\nHodgkin lymphoma isn&#8217;t infectious and&nbsp;isn&#8217;t thought to&nbsp;run in families. Although your&nbsp;risk is&nbsp;increased if a first-degree relative (parent, sibling or child) has had lymphoma, it&#8217;s not clear if this is because of an inherited genetic fault&nbsp;or&nbsp;lifestyle factors.\nHodgkin lymphoma can occur at any age, although most cases are diagnosed in people in their early 20s or 70s. The condition is slightly more common in men than women.\nIf you speak to your GP because you&#8217;re concerned about symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma, they&#8217;ll ask about your health and carry out a simple physical examination.\nIf necessary, your GP&nbsp;will refer you to hospital for further tests.\nIn 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma and refer people for the right tests faster.\nTo find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected Hodgkin lymphoma, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on Suspected cancer: recognition and referral.\nIf you&#8217;re referred to hospital, a biopsy will usually be carried out, as this is the only way to confirm a diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma.\nA&nbsp;biopsy involves removing some or all of an affected lymph node, which is then studied in a laboratory.\nBiopsies are small operations that can often be carried out under a&nbsp;local anaesthetic (where the area is numbed). In some cases, the affected lymph node isn&#8217;t easily accessible and a&nbsp;general anaesthetic may be required (where you&#8217;re asleep).\nA pathologist (an expert in the study of diseased tissue) will then check the tissue sample for the presence of cancerous cells. If they find cancerous cells, they can also identify exactly which type of Hodgkin lymphoma you have, which is an important factor in planning your treatment.\nIf a biopsy confirms a diagnosis of&nbsp;Hodgkin lymphoma, further testing will be needed to check how far the lymphoma has spread. This allows a doctor to diagnose the stage of your lymphoma.\nFurther tests may include:\n- blood tests&nbsp;– samples of blood will be taken throughout your diagnosis and treatment to check your general health, the levels of red and white cells and platelets in your blood, and how well organs such as your liver and kidneys are working\n- bone marrow sample – another biopsy may be carried out to see if the&nbsp;cancer has spread to your bone marrow; this involves using a long needle to remove a sample of bone marrow from your pelvis and can be done using a local anaesthetic\n- chest X-ray&nbsp;– this can check whether the cancer has spread to your chest or lungs\n- computerised tomography (CT) scan – this scan takes a series of X-rays that build up a 3D picture of the inside of the body to check the spread of the cancer\n- magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan&nbsp;– this scan&nbsp;uses strong magnetic fields to build up a detailed picture of areas of your body, to check the spread of the cancer\n- positron emission tomography (PET) scan –&nbsp;this scan measures the activity of cells in different parts of the body and&nbsp;can check the spread of the cancer and the impact of treatment;&nbsp;it&#8217;s usually taken at the same time as a CT scan to show precisely how the tissues of different sites of the body are working\nWhen testing is complete, it should be possible to determine the stage of your lymphoma. Staging means scoring the cancer by how far it&#8217;s spread.\nThe main stages of Hodgkin lymphoma are:\n- stage 1&nbsp;– the&nbsp;cancer is limited to one group of lymph nodes, such as your neck or groin nodes either above or below your diaphragm (the sheet of muscle underneath the lungs)\n- stage 2&nbsp;– 2 or more lymph node groups are affected, either above or below the diaphragm\n- stage 3&nbsp;– the&nbsp;cancer has spread to lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm&nbsp;\n- stage 4&nbsp;– the&nbsp;cancer has spread through the lymphatic system and is now present in organs or bone marrow\nHealth professionals also&nbsp;add the letters A or B to your stage, to&nbsp;indicate whether or not you have certain symptoms.\nA is put after your stage if you&nbsp;have no additional symptoms other than swollen lymph nodes. B is put after your stage if you have&nbsp;additional symptoms of weight loss, fever or night sweats.\nHodgkin lymphoma can usually be treated successfully with chemotherapy alone, or chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy.\nYour specific treatment plan will depend on your general health and your age, as&nbsp;many of the treatments can put a tremendous strain on the body. How far the cancer has spread is also an important factor in determining the best treatment.\nDiscussions about your treatment plan will usually take place with several doctors and other health professionals who specialise in different aspects of treating lymphoma. This is known as a multidisciplinary team (MDT).\nYour MDT will recommend the best treatment options&nbsp;for you. However, you shouldn&#8217;t be rushed into making a decision about your treatment plan. Before deciding, you may wish to talk to friends, family and your partner.\nThe main treatments for Hodgkin lymphoma are chemotherapy alone, or chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. In a few cases, chemotherapy may be combined with steroid medication.\nSurgery isn&#8217;t generally used&nbsp;to treat the condition, except for the&nbsp;biopsy used to diagnose it.\nOverall, treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma is highly effective and most people with the condition are eventually cured.\nChemotherapy&nbsp;is a type of cancer treatment where medicine is used to kill cancer cells. This medication can be given in a number of different ways, depending on&nbsp;the stage of your cancer.\nIf doctors think your cancer is curable, you&#8217;ll normally receive chemotherapy through a drip directly into a vein (intravenous chemotherapy).&nbsp;If a cure is unlikely, you may only need to take chemotherapy tablets to help relieve your symptoms.\nChemotherapy is usually given over a period of a few months on an outpatient basis, which means you shouldn&#8217;t have to stay in hospital overnight. However, there may be times when your symptoms or the side effects of treatment become particularly troublesome and a longer hospital stay may be needed.\nChemotherapy can have several side effects, the most significant of which is potential damage to your bone marrow. This can interfere with the production of healthy blood cells and cause the following problems:\n- fatigue\n- breathlessness\n- increased vulnerability to infection\n- bleeding and bruising more easily\nIf you experience these problems, treatment may need to be delayed so you can produce more healthy blood cells. Growth factor medicines can also stimulate the production of blood cells.\nOther possible side effects of chemotherapy include:\n- nausea and vomiting\n- diarrhoea\n- loss of appetite\n- mouth ulcers\n- tiredness\n- skin rashes\n- hair loss\n- infertility, which may be temporary or permanent\nMost&nbsp;side effects should pass once your treatment has finished.&nbsp;Tell your care team if the side effects become particularly troublesome, as there are treatments&nbsp;that can help.\nRead more about the side effects of chemotherapy.\nIf regular chemotherapy is unsuccessful or Hodgkin lymphoma returns after treatment, you may have a course of chemotherapy at a higher dose.\nHowever, this intensive chemotherapy destroys your bone marrow, leading to the problems mentioned above. You&#8217;ll&nbsp;need a stem cell or&nbsp;bone marrow transplant&nbsp;to replace the damaged bone marrow.\nRadiotherapy&nbsp;is most often used to treat early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma, where the cancer is only in one part of the body.\nTreatment is normally given in short&nbsp;daily sessions, Monday to Friday, over several weeks. You shouldn&#8217;t have to stay in hospital between appointments.\nRadiotherapy itself is painless, but it can have some significant side effects. These can vary and will be directly related to the&nbsp;part of your body being treated. For example, treatment to your throat can lead to a sore throat, while treatment to the head can lead to hair loss.\nOther common side effects&nbsp;include:\n- tiredness\n- nausea and vomiting\n- dry mouth\n- loss of appetite\nMost side effects are temporary,&nbsp;but there&#8217;s a risk of long-term problems, including infertility and permanently darkened skin in the treatment area.\nRead more about:\n- side effects of radiotherapy\n- complications of Hodgkin lymphoma\nSteroid medication&nbsp;is sometimes used in combination with chemotherapy as a more intensive treatment for advanced cases of Hodgkin lymphoma, or&nbsp;if initial treatment hasn&#8217;t worked.\nThe steroid medication is given intravenously, usually at the same time as your chemotherapy.\nCommon side effects of steroid medication include:\n- increased appetite, which can lead to weight gain\n- indigestion\n- problems sleeping\n- feeling agitated\nThe side effects of steroid medication usually start to improve once treatment finishes.\nIf you&#8217;re diagnosed with a rare type of Hodgkin lymphoma called lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma, you may have chemotherapy in combination with a medication called rituximab.\nRituximab is a type of&nbsp;biological therapy&nbsp;called a monoclonal antibody. It&nbsp;attaches itself to the surface of cancerous cells and stimulates the immune system to attack and kill the cell.\nIt&#8217;s given through a drip directly into a vein over the course of a few hours.\nSide effects of the drug can include:\n- flu-like symptoms, such as headaches, fever&nbsp;and muscle pain\n- tiredness\n- nausea\n- diarrhoea\nYou may be given additional medication to prevent or reduce side effects. Any side effects should improve over time as your body gets used to the medication.\nAfter your course of treatment ends, you&#8217;ll need to have regular follow-up appointments to monitor your recovery and check for any signs of the cancer returning.\nThese appointments start off being every few weeks or months, but will become gradually less frequent over time.\nRead further information:\n- Cancer Research UK: Treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma\n- Cancer Research UK: Living with Hodgkin lymphoma\n- Macmillan Cancer Support: Hodgkin lymphoma \nSome people treated for Hodgkin lymphoma experience long-term problems, even if they&#8217;ve been cured.\nHaving a weakened immune system is a common complication of Hodgkin lymphoma and it can become more severe while you&#8217;re being treated.\nIf you have a weak immune system, you&#8217;re more vulnerable to infections and there&#8217;s an increased risk of developing serious complications from infections. In some cases, you may be advised to take regular doses of antibiotics to prevent infections.\nIt&#8217;s also important to report any symptoms of an infection to your GP or care team immediately, as prompt treatment may be needed to prevent serious complications.\nSymptoms of infection include:\n- a high temperature (fever)\n- headache\n- aching muscles\n- diarrhoea\n- tiredness\nYou should make sure that all of your vaccinations are up-to-date.\nHowever, it&#8217;s important to speak to&nbsp;your GP or care team about this, as it may not be safe for you to have &#8216;live&#8217; vaccines (vaccines containing a weakened form of the virus or organism being vaccinated against) until several months after your treatment finishes.\nExamples of live vaccines include the:\n- shingles vaccine\n- BCG vaccine (against tuberculosis)\n- MMR vaccine (against measles, mumps and rubella) \nChemotherapy&nbsp;and&nbsp;radiotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma can cause infertility. This is sometimes temporary, but it can be permanent.\nYour care team will estimate the risk of infertility in your specific circumstances and let you know your options.\nIn some cases, it may be possible for men to store samples of their sperm and for women to store their eggs before treatment, so these can be used to try for a baby afterwards.\nPeople who have had Hodgkin lymphoma are more likely to get lymphoma,&nbsp;leukaemia or other cancers in the future. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy further increase this risk.\nSecond cancers, such as breast cancer or lung cancer, usually develop more than 10 years after you&#8217;re treated for Hodgkin lymphoma. In rare cases, other types of cancer, such as leukaemia or other lymphomas, develop after only a few years.\nYou can help to reduce your risk of a second cancer by adopting a healthy lifestyle by not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight with a balanced diet, and getting regular exercise.\nYou should report any symptoms that might suggest another cancer to your GP at an early stage and attend any cancer screening appointments you&#8217;re invited to.\nThe risk of developing other health conditions in the future, such as cardiovascular disease and lung disease, is also higher in people who have had Hodgkin lymphoma.\nYou should report unexpected symptoms, such as increased shortness of breath, to your GP for further advice."

        "disease": "Hodgkin lymphoma: Children",
        "description": "Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of blood cancer. It can affect children at any age but is more common in older teenagers and young adults.&nbsp;\nMore children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.\nIt’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer. At times it can feel overwhelming, but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.\nUnderstanding more about the cancer your child has, and the treatments that may be used, can often help parents to cope. Your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information and, if you have any questions, it’s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.\nHodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that occurs in the lymphatic system. There are 2 main types of Hodgkin lymphoma: classical Hodgkin lymphoma, which affects 95% of patients, and Lymphocyte Predominant Hodgkin Lymphoma (LPHL), which only affects 5% of patients. This information is about classical Hodgkin lymphoma, but it includes a short section about LPHL.\nThe lymphatic system is part of the immune system, the body’s natural defence against infection and disease.\nThe lymphatic system is made up of the bone marrow, thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes (or lymph glands). Lymph nodes are connected by a network of tiny lymphatic vessels that contain lymph fluid. Lymphomas can start anywhere in the lymphatic system, but Hodgkin Lymphoma is most likely to start in the lymph nodes in the neck. The other areas where lymph nodes are likely to swell are above the collar bone, the armpit, the groin and inside the chest. Glands can swell in these areas as part of the body’s response to infection, not just cancer, which is why a biopsy is needed to diagnose lymphoma.\nThe number of lymph nodes varies from one part of the body to another. In some parts of the body, there are very few lymph nodes, whereas under your arm there may be 20&nbsp;to 50.\nThere are 2 main types of lymphoma:&nbsp;non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)&nbsp;and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Although these are both types of lymphoma, there are differences between them, which means they need different treatment.\nThe exact cause of Hodgkin lymphoma is not known. In most people that develop Hodgkin lymphoma, no cause is found. However, there is increasing evidence that infections, such as the virus that causes glandular fever, may play a part in the development of Hodgkin lymphoma, especially in childhood. Poor immunity may also be a risk factor for developing the disease. Very rarely, more than one member of a family may develop Hodgkin lymphoma but it is not inherited from parents and you cannot catch it from another person.\nThe first sign of Hodgkin lymphoma is usually a painless swelling of 1 gland, or a group of lymph glands, which continues for some weeks or even months. The first glands that are likely to be affected are in the neck or above the collarbone, most often only on 1 side. However, it’s important to remember that children’s glands can also become swollen when they have a common infection that causes a sore throat or a cold. If glands in the chest are affected, this can cause a cough or breathlessness. This is caused by the pressure the glands exert on the airways.\nSometimes, a child with Hodgkin lymphoma may have a high temperature (fever), night sweats, weight loss or itchy skin.\nAs lymph glands can swell for lots of reasons, a biopsy is carried out to diagnose Hodgkin lymphoma. A biopsy is when a swollen lymph gland is removed and the cells are looked at under a microscope. It’s a small operation which is usually done under a general anaesthetic. Sometimes only a small part of the lymph gland has to be removed, which can be done under a local anaesthetic.\nIf Hodgkin lymphoma is diagnosed after the biopsy, further tests are carried out to find out the exact size and position of the lymphoma, and to see whether it has spread beyond the original area. These tests include X-rays, blood tests, CT, MRI and PET scans.\nVery often, a bone marrow sample will be taken. This is because the lymphoma cells can spread to the bone marrow as well as to other lymph glands.\nThe tests that are carried out are called staging tests. Any tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you. The&nbsp;Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group&nbsp;(CCLG) has more information about what the tests and scans involve.\nThe stage of Hodgkin lymphoma describes the size and position of the cancer and whether it has spread. Staging is very important because the type of treatment your child receives will depend on the stage of the disease. The staging system for Hodgkin lymphoma is as follows:\n- stage 1 – only 1 group of lymph nodes is affected and the lymphoma is only on 1 side of the diaphragm (the sheet of muscle under the lungs that controls breathing)\n- stage 2 – 2&nbsp;or more groups of lymph nodes are affected, but they are only on 1 side of the diaphragm.\n- stage 3&nbsp;– the lymphoma is in lymph nodes both above and below the diaphragm\n- stage 4&nbsp;– the lymphoma has spread outside the lymph nodes to other organs such as the liver, lungs or bone marrow\nAs well as giving each stage a number, doctors also use a letter code – either A, B, or E:\n- A means your child has no symptoms\n- B means your child has 1 or more of the following symptoms: a fever, night sweats or significant weight loss\n- E means that the lymphoma has grown from the lymph gland to extranodal tissue (tissue in places outside the lymph nodes)\nA number and letter is used in the staging of every child with Hodgkin lymphoma. This helps the doctor decide on a treatment plan for your child.\nChildren with Hodgkin lymphoma are usually treated with chemotherapy, but sometimes radiotherapy is also needed. The type and amount of treatment given depend on the stage of the disease when it is diagnosed. Your child’s doctor will discuss the treatment options with you.\nThis is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells.\nIt is usual for a combination of drugs to be used, which will often be given every few weeks over a number of months. A combination of drugs is used because each chemotherapy drug works in a different way. Using several drugs together increases the effectiveness of the treatment. It also means lower doses of individual drugs can be used, which may reduce the possibility of long-term side effects.\nThis is used in less than half of people with Hodgkin lymphoma. It treats cancer by using high energy rays that destroy the cancer cells while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells.\nTreatment for Hodgkin lymphoma can cause side effects, and your child’s doctor will discuss these with you before the treatment starts. Any possible side effects will depend on the particular treatment being used and the part of the body that is being treated.\nSome general side effects of chemotherapy that can occur during treatment include:\n- feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting)\n- hair loss\n- low blood count which can lead to an increased risk of infection, bruising and bleeding\n- tiredness\nChanges to your child’s sense of taste and changes in their bowel may also happen. If your child has side effects from the treatment it is important to discuss them with your doctor or nurse. They may be able to help reduce them.\nThe cure rate for Hodgkin lymphoma is very high, which means some children may develop side effects many years after treatment. The chance of developing late side effects depends on where the original tumour was, how far it spread, and the type of treatment your child had.\nThese late side effects can affect the normal organs such as the heart, kidneys and lungs. Following treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma, there is a small increase in the risk of developing another cancer in later life. There is also a chance that fertility may be affected. Teenage boys who are diagnosed after puberty should have the option of sperm banking before treatment starts. In this situation, sperm can be stored for possible use in later years.\nYour child’s doctor or nurse will explain more about any possible late side effects.\nMany children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version.\nThe aim of treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma is to cure the cancer with the fewest possible short and long-term side effects. This is particularly important in childhood Hodgkin lymphoma where cure rates are high. It’s important to get the balance right between curing the cancer and having the lowest risk of long-term side effects.\nIf appropriate, your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial and will answer any questions you may have. Written information is often provided to help explain things.\nTaking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide whether it’s right for your child.\nSometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child’s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The&nbsp;Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group&nbsp;(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.\nAbout 90% of children who develop Hodgkin lymphoma are cured. When your child completes treatment, they will then go into a follow-up phase, seeing doctors and nurses in out-patient clinics usually for around five years. Clinic visits will be every 3&nbsp;to 4 months to start with and there will be occasional scans, X-rays, and blood tests done for several years after completing treatment.\nIf the cancer comes back, a different course of treatment can be given. If you have specific concerns about your child’s condition and treatment, it’s best to discuss them with your child’s doctor, who knows the situation.\nThis is a rare type of Hodgkin lymphoma that affects around 5% of patients. LPHL usually grows at a slower rate than classical Hodgkin lymphoma and normally requires less intensive treatment. Young people with LPHL may have a single swollen gland or group of swollen glands in one area only, such as the neck or groin. The swollen gland often grows very slowly and may be present for many months before a biopsy and diagnosis happens. The biopsy and staging tests will be carried out as with classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The treatment given will depend on the stage of the disease, but most patients are diagnosed with an early stage of the disease.\nLPHL is usually treated with surgery or low-dose chemotherapy. It may return many years after treatment, and further treatment may be required, but it is rarely a life-threatening condition. In rare cases, patients have advanced LPHL and receive more intensive chemotherapy. There is also a link between LPHL and developing a more aggressive&nbsp;non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nAs a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time.\nYour child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer.\nFurther information and advice if your child has cancer"

        "description": "This section is for teenagers and young adults and is about a type of cancer called Hodgkin lymphoma.\nTreatment for Hodgkin lymphoma has a very good success rate and most people are cured.\nHodgkin lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system, which is one of the body’s natural defences against infection.\nLymphomas, like all cancers, are a disease of the body’s cells. Normally cells in our body divide and grow in a controlled way. But sometimes cells keep dividing and grow out of control. This is how cancer develops.\nIn lymphomas, white blood cells called lymphocytes become abnormal and grow out of control. These lymphocytes can build up in one part of the body and form a lump (tumour).\nThere are&nbsp;2 main types of lymphoma:\n- Hodgkin lymphoma\n- non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)&nbsp;\nAlthough these cancers are both lymphomas, they are different and need different treatments. Your doctors will do tests to find out which type you have.\nOne of the most common symptoms is having a painless lump. The lump is caused by swollen lymph nodes. There may be one or more lumps and these may be in your neck, armpit or groin.\nLumps can also be inside the body. A commonplace would be inside the chest and this can cause a cough or breathlessness.\nSome people feel tired and lethargic with lymphoma. Itching of the skin is also quite common.\nSome people with Hodgkin lymphoma have other symptoms such as high temperatures, very heavy sweats (especially at night) and unexplained weight loss. Doctors call these symptoms ‘B symptoms’.\nMost of the symptoms that people get with lymphoma may also be caused by other illnesses. For example swollen lymph nodes, high temperatures and sweats may be caused by an infection. But if you have any of these symptoms or are worried that you may have Hodgkin lymphoma, go to your GP. They’ll examine you and refer you to a hospital if they think you need to see a specialist doctor.\nIt’s not known what causes Hodgkin lymphoma. Research is going on to try to find out. Remember, though, it isn’t anything that you’ve done.\nHodgkin lymphoma is one of the most common cancers in young people over the age of 10. About 1 in 6 of all cancers affecting young people between 15 and 24 is a Hodgkin lymphoma.\nHodgkin lymphoma isn’t infectious and can’t be passed on to other people or family members.\nIf you’re looking for information about Hodgkin lymphoma in people of all ages, read our general&nbsp;Hodgkin lymphoma&nbsp;section."

        "disease": "Huntington’s disease",
        "description": "Huntington&#8217;s disease is a condition that damages nerve cells in the brain causing them to stop working properly. It&#8217;s passed on (inherited) from a person&#8217;s parents.\nThe damage to the brain gets worse over time. It can affect movement, cognition (perception, awareness, thinking, judgement) and mental health.\nPeople can start to show the symptoms of Huntington&#8217;s disease at almost any age. Most will develop problems between the ages of 30 and 50.\nThe condition gradually gets worse for around 10-25 years, until the person dies.\nBehavioural changes are often the first symptoms of Huntington&#8217;s disease. These changes often include:\n- a lack of emotions and not recognising the needs of others\n- periods of aggression, excitement, depression, antisocial behaviour and anger\n- apathy &#8211; causing a person to appear lazy or have a lack of interest in hygiene and self care\n- difficulty concentrating on more than one task and handling complex situations\n- irritability and impulsiveness\nFurther symptoms of Huntington&#8217;s might include:\n- psychiatric problems &#8211; some people develop obsessive behaviours, delusional thoughts or behaviours, stubborness, lack of self awareness, or suicidal thoughts\n- uncontrollable movements of the face, jerking, clicking or fidgety movements of the limbs and body\n- difficulty eating because the mouth and throat muscles don&#8217;t work properly which can lead to choking and chest infections\n- communication problems &#8211; difficulty putting thoughts into words and slurring of speech\n- sexual problems &#8211; a loss of interest in sex or making inappropriate sexual demands\n- balance problems\nIn the later stages of Huntington&#8217;s disease, the person will need full nursing care.\nDeath is usually from a secondary cause, like pneumonia or another infection.\nYou might find the palliative care section useful if you&#8217;re caring for someone who&#8217;s dying, or if you want to plan your end of life care.\nJuvenile Huntington&#8217;s disease is a rare form of the condition that can occur in people under the age of 20. Common signs include:\n- a rapid decline in school performance\n- changes in handwriting\n- problems with movement, such as slowness, stiffness, tremor or muscle twitching (similar to the features of Parkinson&#8217;s disease)\n- seizures (fits)\nHuntington&#8217;s disease is caused by a faulty gene. Cells in parts of the brain are very sensitive to the effects of the faulty gene. This makes them function poorly and eventually die.\nA parent with the Huntington&#8217;s disease gene has one good copy of the gene and one faulty copy.\nThis means there&#8217;s a:\n- 50% chance that each of their children will develop Huntington&#8217;s disease &#8211; affected children can pass the gene to children they may have\n- 50% chance that each of their children won&#8217;t develop Huntington&#8217;s disease &#8211; unaffected children can&#8217;t pass the gene to children they may have\nIt&#8217;s difficult to predict how old a child will be when they develop the condition if they inherit the abnormal gene.\nIn around 3% of cases of Huntington&#8217;s disease, there&#8217;s no obvious family history of the condition. This could be because relatives with the condition died before they were diagnosed with it. In rare cases, it&#8217;s due to a new fault in the gene that causes Huntington&#8217;s disease.\nIf you have symptoms of Huntington&#8217;s disease, your GP will refer you to a specialist clinician.\nThe specialist will ask about your symptoms to:\n- see if it&#8217;s likely you have Huntington&#8217;s disease\n- rule out similar conditions\nThey&#8217;ll examine you and test your thinking, eye movements, balance and walking. They&#8217;ll find out if you have any involuntary movements, such as chorea (fidgety or jerky movements).\nYou might have genetic testing to confirm if you have Huntington&#8217;s disease if:\n- you&#8217;re showing symptoms of the condition and it runs in your family\n- your doctor strongly suspects you have the condition\nDiagnosis is based on the doctor recognising a number of factors like neurological examination, family history and genetic testing.\nThe children of someone with Huntington&#8217;s disease can take a genetic test after the age of 18 to see whether they&#8217;ve inherited the faulty gene.\nIt&#8217;s possible to have the gene change and still be healthy when you&#8217;re tested. This is known as &#8220;premanifest Huntington&#8217;s disease&#8221;.\nIf they&#8217;ve inherited the faulty gene, they&#8217;ll develop Huntington&#8217;s disease, but it&#8217;s not possible to work out when.\nYou can ask your GP or neurologist for an appointment at a genetic clinic. You&#8217;ll receive some counselling and blood samples will be taken. Your DNA from the blood samples will be analysed to see whether you have inherited the faulty gene.\nScottish Huntington’s Association has a national youth service to help and support children and young people who are living within a Huntington’s family.\nIn the early stages of Huntington&#8217;s disease, there may not be any specific changes on the brain scan. A doctor might use a brain scan if they&#8217;re concerned there may be other problems in addition to Huntington&#8217;s disease.\nA brain scan may involve having a computerised tomography (CT scan) or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.\nIf you&#8217;re pregnant and know you have the Huntington&#8217;s disease gene, it&#8217;s possible for your unborn baby to be tested during pregnancy at 11 weeks. You can discuss this with a genetic counselling team.\nPreimplantation genetic diagnosis can be used when one partner is known to have or is at risk of having the faulty gene.\nIt involves having in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment. The embryo is genetically tested to make sure it doesn&#8217;t have the faulty gene before being implanted into the womb.\nNot everyone wants to know if they&#8217;ve inherited the faulty gene. It&#8217;s a personal choice.\nSome people say they would rather not know because they want to enjoy their life and they may die of other causes before the condition develops.\nIf you&#8217;re considering genetic testing, your GP will refer you to a genetic counsellor first.\nThere&#8217;s no cure for Huntington&#8217;s disease. Medication and therapies can help treat some of the symptoms.\nSpeech and language therapy and occupational therapy, can help with communication and day-to-day living.\nRegular exercise is also very important. People who are active tend to feel much better physically and mentally than those who don&#8217;t.\nMost of these medications have side effects, like tiredness. It can sometimes be difficult to tell if the side effects are symptoms of the condition or a result of the medication.\nAntidepressants can help improve mood swings and treat depression.\nMood stabilisers may be considered as a treatment for irritability.\nSome mood stabilizers can&#8217;t be used during pregnancy.\nMedication can suppress involuntary movements. In the UK, antipsychotic medicines are usually preferred.\nAntipsychotic medication might help control delusions and violent outbursts, but they can have severe side effects, such as:\n- stiffness and rigidity\n- sedation\n- moving slowly\nHelp is available to assist people with Huntington&#8217;s disease in their day-to-day life. This might include physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy.\nDaily routines such as getting dressed and eating meals can be frustrating and exhausting. The types of help outlined below aim to ease the strain of the condition by improving skills that may deteriorate.\nSpeech and language therapy can improve communication skills, and memory. It can help with swallowing problems.\nCommunication aids can sometimes be helpful, as they allow communication without the need for talking. For example, you can point to symbols on a chart to show your mood or whether you&#8217;re hungry.\nThe family of someone with Huntington&#8217;s disease can try alternative ways of communicating if speech is a problem.\nPeople with Huntington&#8217;s disease might need to have a high-calorie diet. A dietitian can help you work out an appropriate diet plan.\nFood should be easy to chew, swallow and digest. It can be cut into small pieces or puréed to prevent choking. Feeding equipment like special straws and non-slip mats can help.\nAt some point, you might be offered a feeding tube that goes into the stomach. You might want to consider making an advance decision (a living will) or a statement of wishes and preferences.\nAn occupational therapist (OT) can help with day-to-day activities. Your home can be adapted by social services to make life easier for a person with Huntington&#8217;s disease.\nYou might also need to think about wheelchair access.\nRead more about occupational therapy and how it can help.\nA physiotherapist can help with mobility and balance. It uses a range of treatments, including manipulation, massage, exercise, electrotherapy and hydrotherapy. You may be referred to a physiotherapist through your GP or social services.\nResearch is underway to find disease-modifying medication and new treatments for Huntington&#8217;s disease.\nProgress has been made in identifying potential ways of slowing down or halting the condition by &#8220;switching off&#8221; the faulty gene that causes Huntington&#8217;s disease.\nSpeak to your healthcare professional if you&#8217;re interested in taking part in research for Huntington&#8217;s disease.\nIt&#8217;s worth finding out what benefits you may be entitled to if you have Huntington’s disease, or if you&#8217;re looking after someone with the condition.\nThe Scottish Huntington’s Association Financial Wellbeing Service provides information, confidential advice and support to people living with Huntington’s disease.\nYou can also contact the Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB)\nRead more about benefits if you need care, and carers’ benefits\nA person diagnosed with Huntington&#8217;s disease who&#8217;s started to experience symptoms should inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). The condition will affect their ability to drive.\nThe DVLA will write to your doctor, with your permission, to ask for their opinion about your condition. Based on that information, they&#8217;ll decide whether you can still drive and for how long before another assessment is needed.\nThere&#8217;s no need to tell the DVLA if you&#8217;re carrying the faulty gene but haven&#8217;t yet developed symptoms.\nYou can view the National Care Framework for Huntington&#8217;s Disease on the Scottish Huntington&#8217;s Association (SHA) website. The SHA employs Huntington’s Disease (HD) Specialists in many areas of Scotland who work as part of multi-disciplinary teams along with HD Clinical Leads, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy."

        "disease": "Hydrocephalus",
        "description": "Hydrocephalus is a condition that causes a build up of fluid in the brain. The excess fluid affects the brain and how it functions.\nThe damage to the brain from hydrocephalus can cause symptoms like:\n- headache\n- nausea and vomiting (feeling and being sick)\n- blurred vision\n- drowsiness\n- difficulty walking\nBabies born with hydrocephalus (known as congenital hydrocephalus) often have physical features like:\n- an unusually large head\n- a thin scalp with visible veins\n- a tense or bulging fontanelle (the soft spot on top of a baby&#8217;s head)\n- downward looking eyes\n- delayed development\nHydrocephalus from birth can also cause:\n- muscle stiffness and spasms in your baby&#8217;s lower limbs\n- poor feeding\n- irritability\n- vomiting (being sick)\n- sleepiness\nHydrocephalus that develops in children or adults (acquired hydrocephalus) can cause:\n- headaches that are often worse in the morning or wake you from sleep\n- sleepiness\n- confusion\n- blurred vision or double vision\n- neck pain\n- nausea (feeling sick)\n- vomiting (being sick)\n- difficulty walking\n- urinary incontinence (loss of bladder control)\n- memory issues\n- balance problems\nNormal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) tends to develop slowly over many months or years. It&#8217;s more common in older people.\nNPH can affect:\n- how you walk (mobility)\n- your urinary system\n- your mental abilities\nIf you have NPH you might find it difficult to take the first step when you walk. Some people with NPH describe it as feeling like they&#8217;re frozen on the spot.\nNPH can also cause you to shuffle rather than take proper steps.\nAs NPH progresses, you might be more prone to falls and become increasingly unsteady on your feet. This might be worse when you&#8217;re turning.\nYou might experience urinary incontinence if you have NPH. Symptoms can include:\n- a frequent need to pee\n- an urgent need to pee\n- loss of control of your bladder\nIf you have NPH you might:\n- be slow to respond to questions\n- react slowly to situations\n- take longer to process information\n- difficulty remembering information\nThese symptoms may improve when NPH is treated.\nHydrocephalus can be congenital (present from birth). This is called congenital hydrocephalus. It may be related to other health conditions, like spina bifida.\nHydrocephalus can happen when the normal pathways for brain fluid become blocked. This can be caused by bleeding in the brain or a tumor. This is called obstructive hydrocephalus.\nSometimes the normal pathways for brain fluid are narrower than they should be. This can cause triventricular hydrocephalus.\nHydrocephalus can also happen after bleeding or an infection in the brain. The bleeding or infection reduces the brain&#8217;s ability to absorb brain fluid. This problem continues even after the bleeding or infection has been resolved. This is called aresorbtive hydrocephalus.\nCongenital hydrocephalus can sometimes be diagnosed during a regular pre-natal ultrasound scan. It can also be diagnosed during the newborn physical examination.\nThe other types of hydrocephalus will be diagnosed from a brain scan. This is normally a CT scan or an MRI scan.\nSurgery is necessary to treat hydrocephalus. You or your child may be offered temporary or permanent treatments, depending on your circumstances. The medical professionals treating you will fully explain your options.\nSometimes a baby with hydrocephalus cannot have permanent treatment. In these circumstances, you&#8217;ll be offered a temporary surgical solution.\nIn some cases, surgeons may insert an access device. This involves inserting a small port under the skin. Brain fluid can then be drained from this device using a needle.\nAnother option that may be recommended is a subgaleal shunt. This is where surgeons create a pocket under the skin. Brain fluid can then drain into this pocket.\nMost hydrocephalus cases are treated through surgery to insert a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. This allows fluid to drain from the brain. The fluid normally drains into the abdomen (tummy), but can also drain into the chest cavity or heart.\nIf you have triventricular hydrocephalus, you may be offered an endoscopic third ventriculostomy. This surgery cuts a small hole in the skull and creates a new pathway for brain fluid to circulate.\nThe medical professionals looking after you will explain the procedure and answer any questions you may have.\nAfter surgery, you or your child should be able to live a normal life without restrictions. Regular follow up appointments throughout your life are not normally necessary.\nIf there are signs of a problem with the shunt a scan can help identify the problem.\nSometimes the shunt might not be in the best position and further surgery might be needed to reposition it. Your surgeon will discuss this with you.\nAfter the shunt has been installed, further treatment for hydrocephalus may be needed if the shunt malfunctions or becomes infected. If this happens shunt repair surgery might be needed.\nA shunt blockage can be very serious. It can lead to a build-up of excess fluid in the brain, which can cause brain damage. This will cause the symptoms of hydrocephalus.\nShunt infection can also happen after shunt surgery. Infections are more likely to develop during the first month after surgery.\nPhone your surgical team immediately if you or your child shows symptoms of an infection like:\n- redness and tenderness along the line of the shunt or the wounds\n- a high temperature\n- headache\n- vomiting\n- neck stiffness\n- tummy pain caused by the shunt draining into your tummy\n- irritability or sleepiness in babies\nIf there is an infection, the shunt will have to be removed. Antibiotics will then be used to treat the infection. Once the infection is clear a new shunt can be fitted.\nAs most children have their shunt fitted when they&#8217;re so young, they may need further surgeries throughout their life.\nThere can occasionally be bleeding when a shunt is positioned. This can cause neurological problems. There&#8217;s also a small risk of fits after any type of brain surgery.\nIn younger children, particularly babies, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can run alongside the shunt rather than down it. This can cause the fluid to leak through the skin wound. Additional stitches or further surgery will be needed to stop the leak.\nVisit Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus Scotland for information about how to apply for a medical alert card. You carry the card with you if you&#8217;ve had a shunt fitted.\nAn endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is surgery to create a small hole in the third ventricle, an area of fluid within the brain. This creates an alternative pathway for the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to circulate.\nPossible complications after ETV surgery include:\n- the hole can close\n- your brain may not be able to absorb the CSF that&#8217;s now draining through it\n- infection – although this is less likely than after shunt surgery\n- bleeding inside your brain\n- neurological damage like problems with short term memory, double vision or hormone imbalances\nIf there&#8217;s a problem with the hole, it may be possible to repeat the surgery, or you may need to have a shunt fitted.\nMost nerve problems will get better, but there&#8217;s a small risk of permanent problems.\nThere&#8217;s also a small risk of epilepsy. There&#8217;s a very small risk of an injury to a blood vessel in the brain, which may be fatal."

        "disease": "Hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar)",
        "description": "Hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar)&nbsp;can affect people with&nbsp;type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, as well as pregnant women with gestational diabetes.\nIt can occasionally affect people who don&#8217;t have diabetes, but usually only people who are seriously ill, such as those who have recently had a stroke or heart attack, or have a severe infection.\nHyperglycaemia shouldn&#8217;t be confused with hypoglycaemia, which is when a person&#8217;s blood sugar level drops too low.\nThis information focuses on hyperglycaemia in people with diabetes.\nThe aim of diabetes treatment is to keep blood sugar levels as near to normal as possible. But if you have diabetes, no matter how careful you are, you&#8217;re likely to experience hyperglycaemia at some point.\nIt&#8217;s important to be able to recognise and treat hyperglycaemia, as it can lead to serious health problems if left untreated.\nOccasional mild episodes aren&#8217;t usually a cause for concern and can be treated quite easily or may return to normal on their own. However, hyperglycaemia can be potentially dangerous if blood sugar levels become very high or stay high for long periods.\nVery high blood sugar levels can cause life-threatening complications, such as:\n- diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)&nbsp;– a condition caused by the body needing to break down fat as a source of energy, which can lead to a diabetic coma; this tends to affect people with type 1 diabetes\n- hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS)&nbsp;– severe&nbsp;dehydration caused by the body&nbsp;trying to get rid of excess sugar; this tends to affect people with type 2 diabetes\nRegularly having high blood sugar levels for long periods of time (over months or years) can result in permanent damage to parts of the body such as the eyes, nerves, kidneys and blood vessels.\nIf you experience hyperglycaemia regularly, speak to your doctor or diabetes care team. You may need to change your treatment or lifestyle to keep your blood sugar levels within a healthy range.\nSymptoms of hyperglycaemia in people with diabetes&nbsp;tend to develop slowly over a few days or weeks. In some cases, there may be no symptoms until the blood sugar level is very high.\nSymptoms of hyperglycaemia include:\n- increased&nbsp;thirst and a&nbsp;dry mouth\n- needing to&nbsp;pee frequently\n- tiredness\n- blurred vision\n- unintentional&nbsp;weight loss\n- recurrent infections, such as thrush,&nbsp;bladder infections (cystitis) and skin infections\nSymptoms of hyperglycaemia can also be due to undiagnosed diabetes, so see your GP if this applies to you. You can have a test to check for the condition.\nWhen you&#8217;re first diagnosed with diabetes, your diabetes care team&nbsp;will usually tell you what your blood&nbsp;sugar level is and what you should aim to get it down to.\nYou may be advised to use a testing device to monitor your blood sugar level regularly at home, or you may have an appointment with a nurse or doctor every few months to see what your level is.\nTarget blood&nbsp;sugar levels differ for everyone, but generally speaking:\n- if you monitor yourself at home – a normal target is 4-7mmol/l before eating and under 8.5-9mmol/l two hours after a meal\n- if you&#8217;re tested every few months – a normal target is below 48mmol/mol (or 6.5% on the older measurement scale)\nA variety of things can trigger an increase in blood sugar level in people with diabetes, including:\n- stress\n- an illness, such as a&nbsp;cold\n- eating too much, such as snacking between meals\n- a lack of exercise&nbsp;\n- dehydration\n- missing a dose of your diabetes medication, or taking&nbsp;an incorrect dose\n- over-treating an episode of&nbsp;hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar)\n- taking certain medicines, such as steroid medication\nOccasional episodes of hyperglycaemia can also occur in children and young adults&nbsp;during growth spurts.\nIf you&#8217;ve been diagnosed with diabetes and you have symptoms of hyperglycaemia, follow the advice your care team&nbsp;has given&nbsp;you to reduce your blood sugar level.\nIf you&#8217;re not sure what to do, contact your GP or care team.\nYou may be advised to:\n- change your diet – for example, you may be advised to avoid foods that cause your&nbsp;blood sugar levels to rise, such as cakes or sugary drinks\n- drink plenty of sugar-free fluids – this can help if you&#8217;re dehydrated\n- exercise more often –&nbsp;gentle, regular exercise such as walking can often lower your blood sugar level, particularly if it helps you lose weight\n- if you use insulin, adjust your dose – your care team can give you specific advice about how to do this\nYou may also be advised to monitor your blood sugar level more closely, or test your blood or urine for substances called ketones (associated with diabetic ketoacidosis).\nUntil your blood sugar level is back under control,&nbsp;watch out for additional symptoms that could be a sign of a more serious condition (see below).\nContact&nbsp;your diabetes care team immediately&nbsp;if you have a high blood sugar level and experience the following symptoms:\n- feeling or being sick\n- abdominal (tummy) pain&nbsp;\n- rapid, deep&nbsp;breathing\n- signs of&nbsp;dehydration, such as a headache, dry skin and a weak, rapid heartbeat\n- difficulty staying awake\nThese symptoms&nbsp;could be a sign of diabetic ketoacidosis or a hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (see above) and you may need to be looked after in hospital.\nThere are simple ways to reduce your risk of&nbsp;severe or prolonged hyperglycaemia:\n- Be careful&nbsp;what you eat – be particularly aware of how snacking and eating&nbsp;sugary foods&nbsp;or carbohydrates can affect your blood sugar level.\n- Stick to your&nbsp;treatment plan – remember to take your insulin&nbsp;or other&nbsp;diabetes medications as recommended by your care team.\n- Be as active as possible –&nbsp;getting regular exercise can help stop your blood sugar level rising, but you should check with your doctor first if you&#8217;re taking diabetes medication, as some medicines can lead to hypoglycaemia if you exercise too much\n- Take extra care when you&#8217;re ill –&nbsp;your care team can provide you with some &#8220;sick day rules&#8221; that&nbsp;outline what you can do to keep your blood sugar level under control during an illness.\n- Monitor your blood sugar level – your care team may suggest using a device to check your level at home, so you can spot an increase early and take steps to&nbsp;stop it."

It can also have a negative impact on your quality of life and may lead to&nbsp;feelings of depression and anxiety.\nRead more about the complications of hyperhidrosis.\nThere are no guidelines to determine what &#8220;normal&#8221; sweating is, but if you feel you sweat&nbsp;too much&nbsp;and&nbsp;your sweating&nbsp;has started to interfere with your everyday daily life, you may have hyperhidrosis.\nFor example, you may have hyperhidrosis if:\n- you&nbsp;avoid physical contact, such as shaking hands,&nbsp;because you&nbsp;feel self-conscious about your sweating\n- you don&#8217;t take part in activities, such as dancing or exercise, for fear they will make your sweating worse\n- excessive sweating is interfering with your job – for example, you have difficulty holding tools or using a computer keyboard\n- you&#8217;re having problems with normal daily activities, such as driving\n- you&#8217;re spending a significant amount of time&nbsp;coping with&nbsp;sweating – for example, frequently showering and changing your clothes\n- you become socially withdrawn and self-conscious\nVisit your GP if you feel that your sweating is interfering with your daily activities, or you suddenly start sweating excessively.\nMany people with hyperhidrosis are too embarrassed to seek medical help or believe that nothing can be done to improve it.&nbsp;But&nbsp;treatment is&nbsp;available.\nAlso visit your GP if you are&nbsp;having&nbsp;night sweats, because it can sometimes be a sign of something more serious.\nYour GP will usually be able to diagnose hyperhidrosis based on your symptoms, although occasionally you may need blood and urine tests to&nbsp;check for an underlying cause (see below).\nIn many cases, hyperhidrosis has no obvious cause and is thought to be the result of a problem with the part of the nervous system that controls sweating. This is known as primary hyperhidrosis.\nHyperhidrosis that does have an identifiable cause is known as secondary hyperhidrosis. This can have many different triggers, including:\n- pregnancy or the menopause\n- anxiety\n- certain medications\n- low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)\n- an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism)\n- infections\nRead more about the causes of hyperhidrosis.\nExcessive sweating can be challenging to treat and it may take a while to find a treatment right for you.&nbsp;\nDoctors usually recommend starting with the least invasive treatment first, such as powerful antiperspirants.&nbsp;Lifestyle changes&nbsp;may also help, including:\n- wearing loose and light clothes\n- avoiding triggers, such as alcohol and spicy foods, that could make your sweating worse\n- wearing black or white clothes&nbsp;to&nbsp;help minimise the signs of sweating\nIf this doesn’t help, you may be advised to try treatments such as iontophoresis (the affected area is treated with a weak electric current passed through water or a wet pad), botulinum toxin injections, and even surgery in a few cases.\nHyperhidrosis is usually a long-term condition, but some people experience an improvement with time and the treatments available can often keep the problem under control.\nRead more about treating hyperhidrosis.\nHyperhidrosis is common. It&#8217;s been estimated to affect between 1&nbsp;and 3&nbsp;in every 100 people which means there are likely to be hundreds of thousands of people living with it in the UK.\nHyperhidrosis can develop at any age, although primary hyperhidrosis typically starts during childhood or soon after puberty.\nHyperhidrosis can be divided into 2&nbsp;types, depending on whether an obvious cause can be identified. These are known as primary and secondary hyperhidrosis.\nHyperhidrosis that has no obvious cause is known as primary hyperhidrosis.\nAlthough it&#8217;s not clear&nbsp;why it&nbsp;develops, it&#8217;s thought to be the result of a problem with part of the nervous system called the sympathetic nervous system, and it&#8217;s possible your genes may also play a role.\nThe sympathetic nervous system controls most of your body’s functions that do not require conscious thought, such as movement of food through your body and the movement of urine out of your kidneys and into your bladder.\nThe sympathetic nervous system also acts like a thermostat. If it senses you are getting too hot, it will send a signal from your brain to the millions of sweat glands in your body to produce sweat. The sweat cools on your skin and reduces the temperature of your body.\nA specific type of sweat gland, known as the eccrine glands, appears to be involved in hyperhidrosis. There are more eccrine glands on your armpits, hands, feet and face, which may explain why these areas are often affected by hyperhidrosis.\nIt&#8217;s thought that in cases of primary hyperhidrosis, the brain sends signals to the eccrine glands, even though there is no need to cool the body.\nSome cases of primary hyperhidrosis appear to&nbsp;run in families, which suggests a genetic mutation may be the cause.\nA genetic mutation is where the instructions in your cells become scrambled, which can disrupt the normal workings of the body. Some genetic mutations can be passed down from parents to their children.\nIf a cause of hyperhidrosis can be identified, it&#8217;s known as secondary hyperhidrosis.\nSecondary hyperhidrosis can have a number of different triggers, including:\n- pregnancy\n- the menopause&nbsp;– when a woman’s monthly periods stop\n- anxiety\n- low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)\n- an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism)\n- obesity\n- certain medications – including some antidepressants,&nbsp;propranolol, pilocarpine, and&nbsp;bethanechol\n- being drunk or &#8220;high&#8221; on drugs, or withdrawing from alcohol or drugs if you&nbsp;have become addicted to them\n- some infections, such as&nbsp;tuberculosis and&nbsp;HIV\n- Parkinson’s disease&nbsp;\n- disorders of the blood cells or bone marrow, such as Hodgkin lymphoma (a cancer of the white blood cells)\nSecondary hyperhidrosis often starts more suddenly than primary hyperhidrosis and tends to affect the whole body.\nHyperhidrosis can be challenging to treat and it may take a while to find the best treatment for you. Less invasive treatments will usually be recommended first.\nChanging your lifestyle cannot cure primary hyperhidrosis (hyperhidrosis with no obvious cause), but it can improve your symptoms and help your confidence.\nThe advice below may help.\n- Avoid&nbsp;triggers that you know make your sweating worse, such as spicy foods and alcohol\n- Use antiperspirant frequently, rather than deodorant\n- Avoid wearing tight, restrictive clothing and man-made fibres, such as nylon\n- Wearing black or white clothing can&nbsp;minimise signs of sweating\n- Armpit shields can absorb excessive sweat and protect your clothes\n- Wear socks that absorb moisture, such as thick socks made of natural fibres, or special soles or sports socks designed to absorb moisture\n- Avoid wearing socks made out of man-made materials and change your socks at least twice a day if possible\n- Ideally wear&nbsp;shoes made of leather, and&nbsp;try to alternate between different pairs of shoes every day\nIf&nbsp;a regular antiperspirant doesn&#8217;t&nbsp;control your sweating, your GP may prescribe&nbsp;or suggest&nbsp;a stronger one for you.\nAntiperspirant containing aluminium chloride is often used to treat hyperhidrosis. This works by plugging the sweat glands. You will need to apply it at night just before you go to sleep and wash it off in the morning.\nThe most common side effect of aluminium chloride is mild irritation or itching and tingling where it is applied. Using the antiperspirant less frequently can help reduce irritation. Using emollients (moisturisers) regularly and soap substitutes instead of soap may also help.\nYou may be prescribed a type of medicine called an anticholinergic or antimuscarinic. These work by blocking the effects of a chemical called acetylcholine, which the nervous system uses to activate the sweat glands.\nAnticholinergics are available as tablets or solutions that are applied to affected areas. They&#8217;re not widely used to treat hyperhidrosis and most types are not licensed to treat it, but some people find them helpful.\nPropantheline bromide is an anticholinergic medicine licensed for treating hyperhidrosis. However, anticholinergic medicines unlicensed for hyperhidrosis – such as oxybutynin and glycopyrronium bromide – can also be prescribed if your doctor feels they might help.\nPossible side effects of anticholinergics include a dry mouth, blurred vision, stomach cramps, constipation and difficulty passing urine.\nIf lifestyle changes and treatment don&#8217;t work, your GP may refer you to a dermatologist (a specialist in treating skin conditions) for further treatment, such as iontophoresis, botulinum toxin or surgery.\nIontophoresis&nbsp;may help if you have excessive sweating that affects your hands or feet. It can also be used to treat armpits, although this is usually less effective.\nIontophoresis involves treating affected areas of skin with a weak electric current passed through water or a wet pad. This is thought to help block the sweat glands.\nIf your hands and feet need treating, you place them in a bowl of water and a weak electric current is passed through the water. If your armpits need treating, a wet contact pad is placed against each armpit and a current is passed through the pad.\nThe treatment is not painful but the electric current can cause mild, short-lived discomfort and skin irritation.\nEach session of iontophoresis lasts between 20 and 30 minutes, and you will usually need to have 2&nbsp;to 4&nbsp;sessions a week. Your symptoms should begin to improve after a week or 2, after which further treatment will be required at 1&nbsp;to 4&nbsp;week intervals, depending on how severe your symptoms are.\nIontophoresis is often very effective, although you may need to make regular visits to your local hospital’s dermatology clinic to receive treatment.\nAlternatively, iontophoresis kits that you can use at home may be recommended, with prices in the range of £250-500.\nBotulinum toxin can be injected into the skin in areas of the body affected by hyperhidrosis. This helps reduce sweating in these areas by blocking the signals from the brain to the sweat glands.\nAround 15-20 injections are given in the affected areas of the body, such as the armpits, hands, feet or face. The procedure usually takes about 30-45 minutes in total.\nThe effect of the injections usually lasts for several months, after which time the treatment can be repeated if necessary.\nPotential side effects of&nbsp;botulinum toxin injections include:\n- pain, redness or itching where the injections are given\n- nausea, headaches and hot flushes after the injections are given\n- another part of your body sweating more to make up for treated area – known as compensatory sweating\n- muscle weakness around the treatment area\nMost of these side effects are short-lived or will resolve as the effect of the injections wears off.\nAvailability of botulinum toxin on the NHS can vary widely depending on your clinical commissioning group (CCG), and you may only be able to get it privately. Costs for private treatment depend on the part of the body being treated. For example, injecting the forehead can cost around £150, while treating both armpits could cost up to £450 or more.\nIn a few cases where hyperhidrosis is particularly severe and treatment&nbsp;hasn&#8217;t been successful, surgery may be recommended.\nEndoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS) is the most widely used type of surgery to treat hyperhidrosis. It&#8217;s usually used in cases affecting the palms or armpits.\nSmall incisions are made in the side of the chest and the nerves that control sweating in the affected area are cut or clipped. This means signals can no longer pass along them to the sweat glands. The operation is carried out under general anaesthetic and done on both sides of the body.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that ETS can be used to treat excessive sweating of the palms or underarms. However, before the procedure is performed, your clinician should explain:\n- ETS&nbsp;carries a risk of serious complications (see below)\n- it&#8217;s very common for excessive compensatory sweating to occur after the procedure, which causes some people to regret the procedure\n- the procedure is not always successful at reducing sweating\nFor this reason, only people with severe hyperhidrosis which hasn&#8217;t responded to treatment should be considered.\nRead the full NICE guidelines on endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy for primary hyperhidrosis of the upper limb.\nSide effects and complications of ETS can also include:\n- sweating of the face and neck after eating food – this is known as gustatory sweating and may affect up to half of people who have the procedure\n- bleeding into the chest during surgery\n- air becoming trapped inside the chest (pneumothorax), which can cause chest pain and breathing difficulties\n- damage to the nervous system that causes&nbsp;the upper eyelid on one side of the body to droop (Horner&#8217;s syndrome) – this may be permanent\nExcessive sweating under the arms may occasionally be treated with a procedure to remove or destroy the sweat glands in the armpits.\nThis can be carried out in a number of ways:\n- making an incision in the armpit and carefully scraping away (curettage) or cutting out (Shelley’s procedure) the sweat glands\n- using a probe held above the skin (no incisions are needed), which emits electromagnetic radiation that destroys the sweat glands\n- inserting a laser device under the skin through a small incision and using it to destroy the sweat glands\nThese procedures are generally carried out under local anaesthetic, which means you will be awake but your armpit will be numbed.\nThese procedures can sometimes be a permanent solution to excessive underarm sweating, although they are only carried out by a small number of practitioners. Availability on the NHS is likely to be very limited and you will probably need to pay for private treatment.\nThese procedures don&#8217;t work for everyone and some of them are relatively new, which means there isn&#8217;t always evidence about their long-term safety and effectiveness.\nFeelings of anxiety are not directly responsible for causing primary hyperhidrosis, but they can make the situation worse and create a vicious cycle.\nYou may feel self-conscious, which can trigger anxiety in certain situations, such as when meeting new people or being in a crowded room. The anxiety can make the sweating worse.\nIf your anxiety is making your sweating worse, a type of talking therapy called cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)&nbsp;might help. Medication for anxiety is not usually recommended because it can make sweating worse.\nHyperhidrosis doesn&#8217;t usually pose a serious threat to your health, but it can sometimes lead to physical and emotional problems.\nHyperhidrosis increases the risk of developing fungal infections, particularly&nbsp;on the feet&nbsp;– most&nbsp;commonly fungal nail infections and athlete’s foot. This is because excessive sweat combined&nbsp;with wearing socks and shoes creates an ideal surrounding for fungi to grow.\nFungal infections can be treated with antifungal creams. More severe cases may require antifungal tablets or capsules.\nExcessive sweat can make you more vulnerable to&nbsp;certain skin conditions, such as:\n- warts&nbsp;– small, rough lumps on the skin that are caused by the HPV virus\n- boils&nbsp;– swollen red-yellow bumps in the skin that can develop when a hair follicle becomes infected\nEczema can&nbsp;also be made worse by excessive sweating.\nAlthough people with hyperhidrosis sweat a lot, most don&#8217;t have problems with body odour. This is because hyperhidrosis doesn&#8217;t usually affect the sweat glands responsible for producing unpleasant-smelling sweat – called the aprocrine sweat glands.\nHowever, if bacteria are allowed to break down the sweat, it can start to smell unpleasant. Eating spicy food and drinking alcohol can also make sweat secreted from the eccrine smell.\nThis can be prevented or eased by following lifestyle advice, such as frequently using antiperspirant spray and using armpit shields to absorb sweat.\nSee treating hyperhidrosis for more information.\nThe emotional impact of living with hyperhidrosis can be severe. Many people with the condition feel unhappy and, in some cases, depressed. Signs that you may be depressed include:\n- feeling down, depressed, or hopeless during the past month\n- having little interest or pleasure in things during the past month\nIt is important not to neglect your mental health. Make an appointment to see your GP if you think that you may be depressed.&nbsp;\nRead&nbsp;more about&nbsp;depression&nbsp;or find out more about&nbsp;tackling stress, anxiety and depression."

        "disease": "Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar)",
        "description": "Hypoglycaemia, or a &#8220;hypo&#8221;, is an abnormally low level of glucose in your blood (less than four millimoles per litre).\nWhen your glucose (sugar)&nbsp;level is too&nbsp;low, your body doesn&#8217;t have enough energy to carry out its activities.\nHypoglycaemia is most commonly associated with diabetes, and mainly occurs if someone with diabetes takes too much insulin, misses a meal or exercises too hard.\nIn rare cases, it&#8217;s possible for a person who doesn&#8217;t have diabetes&nbsp;to experience hypoglycaemia. It can be triggered by malnutrition,&nbsp;binge drinking or certain conditions, such as Addison&#8217;s disease.\nRead more about the causes of hypoglycaemia\nMost people will have some warning that their blood&nbsp;glucose levels are too low, which gives them time to correct them. Symptoms usually occur when blood sugar levels fall below four millimoles (mmol) per litre.\nTypical early warning signs are feeling hungry, trembling or shakiness, and sweating. In more severe cases, you may also feel confused and have difficulty concentrating. In very severe cases, a person experiencing hypoglycaemia can lose consciousness.\nIt&#8217;s also possible for hypoglycaemia to occur during sleep, which can cause excess sweating, disturbed sleep, and feeling tired and confused upon waking.\nRead more about the symptoms of hypoglycaemia\nThe immediate treatment for hypoglycaemia is to have some food or drink that contains sugar, such as dextrose tablets or fruit juice, to correct your blood glucose levels.\nAfter having something sugary, you may need to have a longer-acting &#8220;starchy&#8221; carbohydrate food, such as&nbsp;a sandwich or a&nbsp;few biscuits.\nIf hypoglycaemia causes a loss of consciousness, an injection of the hormone glucagon can be given to raise blood glucose levels and restore consciousness. This is only&nbsp;if an injection is available and the person giving the injection knows how to use it.\nYou should dial 999 to request an ambulance if:\n- a glucagon injection kit isn&#8217;t available\n- there&#8217;s nobody trained to give the injection\n- the injection is ineffective after 10 minutes\nNever try to put food or drink into the mouth of someone who&#8217;s drowsy or unconscious&nbsp;as they could choke.&nbsp;This includes some of the high-sugar preparations specifically designed for smearing inside the cheek.\nRead more about treating hypoglycaemia\nIf you have diabetes that requires treatment with insulin, the safest way&nbsp;to avoid hypoglycaemia is to regularly check your blood sugar and learn to recognise the early symptoms.\nMissing meals or snacks or eating less carbohydrate than planned can increase your risk of hypoglycaemia. You should be careful when drinking alcohol&nbsp;as it can also&nbsp;cause hypoglycaemia, sometimes many hours after drinking.\nExercise or activity is another potential cause, and you should have a&nbsp;plan for dealing with this, such as eating carbohydrate before, during or after exercise, or adjusting your insulin dose.\nYou should also make sure you regularly change where you inject insulin&nbsp;as the amount of insulin your body absorbs can differ depending on where it&#8217;s injected.\nAlways carry rapid-acting carbohydrate&nbsp;with you, such as glucose tablets, a carton of fruit juice (one that contains sugar), or some sweets in case you feel symptoms coming on or your blood glucose level is low.\nMake sure your friends and family know about your diabetes and the risk of hypoglycaemia. It may also help to carry some form of identification that lets people know about your condition in an emergency.\nWhen hypoglycaemia occurs as the result of&nbsp;an underlying condition other than diabetes, the condition will need to be treated to prevent a further hypo.\nRead more about&nbsp;preventing hypoglycaemia\nThe symptoms of hypoglycaemia usually begin when your blood glucose level drops below four millimoles (mmol) per litre.\nIf you have diabetes,&nbsp;particularly if it&#8217;s treated with insulin, you may be advised to use a small device called a blood glucose meter to&nbsp;regularly check your blood glucose levels.\nSymptoms can vary from person to person, and it&#8217;s important to be aware of the early warning signs so you can treat them.\nSigns and symptoms of hypoglycaemia can include:\n- feeling hungry\n- sweating\n- dizziness\n- tiredness (fatigue)\n- blurred vision\n- trembling or shakiness\n- going pale\n- fast pulse or&nbsp;palpitations\n- tingling lips\n- irritability\n- difficulty concentrating\n- confusion\n- disorderly or irrational behaviour, which may be mistaken for drunkenness\nIf hypoglycaemia isn&#8217;t treated promptly and your blood glucose levels drop low enough, you may become drowsy or even lose consciousness.\nMost people with insulin-treated diabetes notice that the symptoms of hypoglycaemia change and become less obvious the longer they live with the condition.\nFor some people, the warning symptoms become greatly reduced, putting them at significant risk of having severe episodes where they&#8217;re dependent on others for help.\nLet your diabetes care team know if you develop this problem&nbsp;as your treatment may need to be changed to reduce the risk.\nRead more about how hypoglycaemia is treated\nHaving a&nbsp;hypo while you&#8217;re asleep is known as nocturnal hypoglycaemia. It&#8217;s more common in people who treat diabetes with insulin.\nAlthough some people find their sleep is disturbed when they experience nocturnal hypoglycaemia,&nbsp;you may only notice the symptoms when you wake up in the morning.\nThe symptoms of&nbsp;nocturnal hypoglycaemia can include:\n- headache&nbsp;–&nbsp;often likened to having a hangover\n- feeling unusually tired in the morning\n- damp sheets or clothing from sweating\nIn most cases, hypoglycaemia affects people with diabetes, although more rarely it can also occur as a result of other underlying conditions.\nA common cause of hypoglycaemia is taking too much insulin for your current needs. Insulin is a medication that helps control your blood glucose levels. It&#8217;s commonly used to treat&nbsp;type 1 diabetes&nbsp;and is also recommended for some&nbsp;people with&nbsp;type 2 diabetes.\nA fall in blood&nbsp;glucose levels can also occur after taking too much oral hypoglycaemia medication, such as sulphonylurea, which causes a release of insulin. This medication is often used&nbsp;to lower blood glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes.\nFor people with type 1 diabetes, maintaining the correct blood glucose level involves balancing&nbsp;how much&nbsp;insulin you inject, the amount of food you eat, and how much energy you burn during exercise.\nHypoglycaemia may occur if you&#8217;ve taken your dose of insulin as usual, but your carbohydrate intake is lower than normal or has been used up more quickly. This may happen if you delay or miss a meal or snack, don&#8217;t eat enough carbohydrate, or exercise more than usual.\nPeople with diabetes who&#8217;ve&nbsp;drunk too much alcohol, or drank alcohol on an empty stomach, can also get hypoglycaemia.\nHowever, it&#8217;s not always possible to identify why a particular episode of hypoglycaemia has occurred, and sometimes it happens for no obvious reason.\nHypoglycaemia&nbsp;– even mild cases&nbsp;–&nbsp;is very rare in people who don&#8217;t have diabetes. The possible causes are outlined below.\nPeople without diabetes can sometimes experience hypoglycaemia if their pancreas produces too much insulin after a large carbohydrate-based meal. This is known as reactive hypoglycaemia.\nIt&#8217;s not clear why this happens, although it&#8217;s thought to be more common in people who are overweight or have had gastric bypass surgery.\nIn rare cases, a benign (non-cancerous) tumour in the pancreas may cause an overproduction of insulin, or the tumour itself may use up too much glucose.\nOther possible causes of hypoglycaemia in people without diabetes are:\n- fasting or malnutrition – where not enough nutrients are consumed for your body to function properly\n- binge drinking or heavy drinking of alcohol\n- Addison&#8217;s disease – a disorder of the adrenal glands (two small glands that sit on top of the kidneys)&nbsp;\n- certain medication – hypoglycaemia has been known to occur in people taking quinine (for malaria), salicylates (for rheumatic disease) and propranolol (for high blood pressure)\n- severe illnesses affecting the liver, kidneys or thyroid gland\nIn most cases, you can treat hypoglycaemia yourself when you recognise the symptoms.\nThe immediate treatment for hypoglycaemia is to have some sugary food or drink (about 15 to 20g of rapidly acting carbohydrate) to end the attack.\nFor example, this could be:\n- a glass of fruit juice or non-diet soft drink\n- between three and five dextrose tablets\n- a handful of sweets\nAt first you should avoid fatty foods and drinks, such as chocolate and milk, because they don&#8217;t usually contain as much sugar and the sugar they do contain may be absorbed more slowly.\nAfter having something sugary, you should have a longer-acting carbohydrate food, such as a few biscuits, a cereal bar, a piece of fruit or a sandwich.\nIt will usually take around 15 minutes to recover from a mild episode of hypoglycaemia. If you have a blood glucose meter, measure your blood sugar again after 15 to 20 minutes. If it&#8217;s still too low (below 4mmol), you should have some more sugary food or a drink before testing&nbsp;your levels&nbsp;again in another 15 to 20&nbsp;minutes.\nWhen treating someone else with hypoglycaemia, if the above treatment isn&#8217;t effective, you may be able to help them by applying glucose gel (or honey, treacle or jam if glucose gel isn&#8217;t&nbsp;available) to the inside of their cheeks, and gently massaging the outside of their cheeks.\nIt may take 10 to 15 minutes before they feel better. This shouldn&#8217;t be done if the person is drowsy or unconscious because of the risk of choking.\nIf you have several episodes of hypoglycaemia a week, you should contact your diabetes care team to find out the underlying cause. Your medication may need to be adjusted, or there may be another condition causing hypoglycaemia that needs to be treated.\nIf a person loses consciousness&nbsp;because of&nbsp;severe hypoglycaemia, they need to be put into the&nbsp;recovery position and given an injection of the hormone glucagon&nbsp;(if they have an injection kit). The injection will raise their blood glucose level.\nThe injection should be carried out by a friend or family member who knows what they&#8217;re doing, or by a trained healthcare professional.\nYou should dial 999 to request an ambulance if:\n- a glucagon injection kit isn&#8217;t available\n- there&#8217;s nobody available who&#8217;s trained to give the injection\n- the injection is ineffective after 10 minutes\nNever try to put food or drink into the mouth of someone who&#8217;s unconscious as&nbsp;they could choke.\nIf you&#8217;re able to give a glucagon injection and the person regains consciousness, they should&nbsp;eat some longer-acting carbohydrate food, such as a few biscuits, a cereal bar or a sandwich.\nYou should continue to monitor the person for signs of recurring symptoms&nbsp;in case they need to be treated again.\nIf you have diabetes, sticking to your medication plan and eating regular meals can help prevent hypoglycaemia.\nIt&#8217;s also important to monitor your blood glucose levels.\nRegularly&nbsp;monitoring your blood glucose levels&nbsp;can help you keep your blood glucose as normal and stable as possible, and will help you spot the signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia quickly.\nYour blood glucose level can vary throughout the day, so you may need to check it several times a day, depending on the treatment you&#8217;re taking.\nYou can&nbsp;monitor your blood glucose levels using a blood glucose meter, a small device that measures the concentration of glucose in your blood.\nRead more about&nbsp;living with type 1 diabetes and&nbsp;living with type 2 diabetes\nIf you have diabetes, strenuous physical activity can lead to hypoglycaemia. Eating extra carbohydrate-based foods before and during exercise can help reduce&nbsp;the chances of this happening.\nIf you&#8217;re taking insulin, your doctor may advise you to lower your dose before&nbsp;you do&nbsp;strenuous physical activity.\nAlcohol can also affect your body&#8217;s ability to release glucose. If you have type 1 diabetes, it&#8217;s recommended that you drink no more than 2 to 3&nbsp;units of alcohol a day and eat a snack after drinking alcohol.\nAs hypoglycaemia can develop suddenly, it&#8217;s important to be aware of the&nbsp;symptoms of hypoglycaemia so you can treat it quickly. Tell your family and friends about the signs to look out&nbsp;for and&nbsp;let them know how to treat it.\nPeople with&nbsp;diabetes are advised to carry a form of identification with them that states their condition so they can be helped quickly and efficiently.\nIf you&#8217;re at risk of hypoglycaemia, you should carry sugary food and drink with you at all times to treat mild cases as soon as possible.\nIf you have diabetes, particularly type 1 diabetes, your doctor may recommend medications such as glucose gel&nbsp;to carry with you. This can be used to treat hypoglycaemia that doesn&#8217;t respond to normal treatment.\nIf you&#8217;re being treated with insulin, you&#8217;ll usually be given a kit that contains an&nbsp;injection of a medication called glucagon. Family members or your carer can be trained&nbsp;to carry out the injection, which should be used if you lose consciousness because of&nbsp;severe hypoglycaemia.\nIt&#8217;s important to avoid recurrent hypoglycaemia during the night (nocturnal hypoglycaemia)&nbsp;as it can reduce the early symptoms of daytime episodes.\nIf you experience nocturnal hypoglycaemia, you can try:\n- keeping something sugary by your bedside\n- having a snack before bedtime, such as biscuits and milk\n- checking your blood glucose levels between 3am and 4am, when&nbsp;hypoglycaemia is most likely to occur\nAs hypoglycaemia can cause confusion, drowsiness, or even unconsciousness, this can present a significant risk to you or other road users.\nIf you have diabetes that requires treatment with insulin, you must:\n- inform the DVLA and your insurance company\n- test your blood sugar before driving and at regular intervals (at least every&nbsp;two hours) while driving\n- avoid driving if your blood glucose is low\n- avoid driving for 45 minutes after treating hypoglycaemia\n- carry rapid-acting carbohydrates with you in the vehicle at all times\nIf you experience hypoglycaemia while driving, pull over and stop as soon as it&#8217;s safe to do so. Remove the keys from the ignition and get out of the driver&#8217;s seat before&nbsp;treating hypoglycaemia in the normal way.\nIf you have two or more episodes of hypoglycaemia that require assistance in a 12-month period, it&#8217;s a legal requirement to stop driving and inform the DVLA.\nIf you&#8217;re a group two driver (you hold a licence to drive buses, coaches or lorries), you&#8217;re legally required to stop driving group two vehicles immediately and inform the DVLA if you have a single episode of hypoglycaemia that requires assistance.\nInform your diabetes care team if you start having problems recognising hypoglycaemia or you start to have more regular episodes, even&nbsp;if there were&nbsp;warning symptoms and you were able to treat them without assistance.\nSee the&nbsp;GOV.UK website for more information about hypoglycaemia and driving"

        "disease": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis",
        "description": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is where the lungs become scarred and breathing becomes more difficult.\nIt&#8217;s not clear what causes it, but it usually affects people around 70 to 75 years old. It&#8217;s rare to develop in people under 50. The older you are, the more likely you are to develop IPF.\nAntifibrotic treatment can help slow IPF. But there&#8217;s currently no treatment that can stop or reverse the scarring of the lungs.\nThe symptoms of IPF tend to develop gradually and get slowly worse over time.\nSymptoms can include:\n- shortness of breath\n- a persistent dry cough\n- tiredness\n- loss of appetite and weight loss\n- rounded and swollen fingertips (clubbed fingers)\nMany people ignore their breathlessness at first and blame it on getting old or being out of shape. But eventually even light activity like getting dressed can cause shortness of breath.\nThe strain IPF can put on your lungs and heart increases the risk of secondary conditions, like:\n- chest infections and airway infections, for example bronchitis, pneumonia and influenza (flu)\n- pulmonary hypertension\n- right sided heart failure\nYou have:\nYour GP may ask if you:\n- smoke, or smoked in the past\n- have been exposed to harmful substances at work, such as asbestos\n- have other medical conditions\nThey may also:\n- check the sound of your breathing through a stethoscope – a crackling sound can suggest lung scarring (fibrosis)\n- look at your fingers to see if the ends are swollen (finger clubbing)\n- ask you to walk around for a few minutes to see if you become breathless\n- arrange a chest X-ray\nIf your GP thinks you could have a lung condition like IPF, they can refer you to a hospital specialist for tests such as:\n- lung (pulmonary function) tests to check how well your lungs work\n- blood tests\n- a computerised tomography (CT) scan to see if there&#8217;s anything causing your symptoms like cancer, a build up of fluid or scarring\nUsually, IPF is diagnosed without the need for additional tests. Sometimes your specialist may consider other tests such as:\n- bronchoscopy (where a narrow, flexible tube with a camera is passed down into your airways) to look for anything abnormal and take a tissue sample for testing\n- a lung biopsy (where a small piece of lung tissue is removed during keyhole surgery so it can be analysed)\n- an echocardiogram\nThere&#8217;s currently no cure for IPF, but there are several treatments that can help relieve the symptoms and slow down its progression.\nTreatments include:\n- lifestyle changes – such as stopping smoking, eating healthily and exercising regularly\n- medication such as pirfenidone and nintedanib to reduce the rate at which scarring worsens – often your specialist team will monitor you, your breathing tests and your scan to see if your condition is progressing over time before starting treatment\n- breathing oxygen through a mask – if your oxygen levels are low when you&#8217;re resting, your specialist team may recommend wearing oxygen all the time, but if they are only low when you move around around, you may only need this when you are out and about\n- pulmonary rehabilitation – exercises and advice to help you breathe more easily\n- a lung transplant – this is suitable in a few cases, although donor lungs are rare and patients have to be otherwise very fit to benefit from a transplant\nIn people with IPF, the tiny air sacs in the lungs (alveoli) become damaged and increasingly scarred. This causes the lungs to become stiff and means it&#8217;s difficult for oxygen to get into the blood.\nThe reason this happens is not known. Idiopathic means the cause is unknown.\nIPF has been linked to:\n- exposure to certain types of dust, such as metal or wood dust\n- viral infections\n- a family history of IPF\n- gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)\n- smoking\nBut it&#8217;s not known whether some of these factors directly cause IPF.\nAs well as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, there are other forms of fibrotic lung disease. These include Non Specific Interstitial Pneumonia (NSIP), Hypersensitivity Pneumonia, Connective Tissue Disease related Interstitial Lung Disease, Vasculitis, Asbestosis and Sarcoidosis.\nIt&#8217;s possible to have other chronic lung diseases as well as fibrotic lung disease. This includes:\n- bronchiectasis\n- asthma\n- chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) – this is known as Combined Pulmonary Fibrosis and Emphysema (CPFE)\nIf you&#8217;re told there is nothing more that can be done to treat your IPF or you decide you don&#8217;t want treatment, your GP or care team will give you support and treatment to relieve your symptoms. This is called palliative care.\nRead further information about palliative care."

        "disease": "Impetigo",
        "description": "Impetigo is a common and highly contagious skin infection that causes sores and blisters. It&#8217;s not usually serious and often improves within a week of treatment or within a few weeks without treatment.\nImpetigo is the most common skin infection in young children in the UK, but it can affect people of all ages.\nThere are 2 types of impetigo:\n- non-bullous impetigo – the most common type\n- bullous impetigo\nThe symptoms of non-bullous impetigo begin with the appearance of red sores – usually around the nose and mouth but other areas of the face and the limbs can also be affected.\nThe sores quickly burst leaving behind thick, golden crusts typically around 2cm across. The appearance of these crusts is sometimes likened to cornflakes stuck to the skin.\nAfter the crusts dry, they leave a red mark that usually fades without scarring. The time it takes for the redness to disappear can vary between a few days and a few weeks.\nThe sores aren&#8217;t painful, but they may be itchy. It&#8217;s important not to touch or scratch the sores because this can spread the infection to other parts of the body, and to other people.\nOther symptoms, such as a high temperature (fever) and swollen glands, are rare but can occur in more severe cases.\nThe symptoms of bullous impetigo begin with the appearance of fluid-filled blisters (bullae) which usually occur on the central part of the body between the waist and neck, or on the arms and legs. The blisters are usually about 1cm to 2cm across.\nThe blisters may quickly spread, before bursting after several days to leave a yellow crust that usually heals without leaving any scarring.\nThe blisters may be painful and the area of skin surrounding them may be itchy. As with non-bullous impetigo, it&#8217;s important not to&nbsp;touch or scratch the affected areas of the skin.\nSymptoms of fever and swollen glands are more common in cases of bullous impetigo.\nAdults and children over 2 years with impetigo can get advice and treatment directly from a pharmacy. Find your local pharmacy on Scotland&#8217;s Service directory.\nImpetigo isn&#8217;t usually serious and can be treated by a pharmacist. Your pharmacist may recommend that you contact your GP practice if required.\nImpetigo occurs when the skin becomes infected with bacteria, usually either&nbsp;Staphylococcus aureus or&nbsp;Streptococcus pyogenes.\nThe bacteria can infect the skin in 2 main ways:\n- through a break in otherwise healthy skin – such as a cut, insect bite or other injury – this is known as primary impetigo\n- through skin damaged by another underlying skin condition, such as head lice, scabies or eczema – this is known as secondary impetigo\nThe bacteria can be spread easily through close contact with someone who has the infection, such as through direct physical contact, or by sharing towels or flannels.\nAs the condition doesn&#8217;t cause any symptoms until 4 to 10 days after initial exposure to the bacteria, it&#8217;s often easily spread to others unintentionally.\nChildren and people with diabetes or a weakened immune system – either due to a condition such as HIV or a treatment such as chemotherapy – are most at risk of developing impetigo.\nImpetigo usually gets better without treatment in around 2 to 3 weeks.\nHowever, treatment is often recommended because it can reduce the length of the illness to around seven to 10 days and can&nbsp;lower the&nbsp;risk of the infection being spread to others.\nThe main treatments prescribed are&nbsp;antibiotic creams or antibiotic tablets. These usually have to be used for around a week.\nRead about treating impetigo.\nDuring treatment, it&#8217;s important to take precautions to minimise the risk of impetigo spreading to other people or to other areas of the body.\nMost people are no longer contagious after 48 hours of treatment or once their sores have dried and healed. It&#8217;s important to&nbsp;stay away from work, school, nursery or playgroup until this&nbsp;point.\nThe advice below can also&nbsp;help to prevent the spread of the infection:\n- do not share flannels, sheets or towels with anyone who has impetigo – wash them at a high temperature after use\n- wash the sores with soap and water and cover them loosely with a gauze bandage or clothing\n- avoid&nbsp;touching or scratching the sores, or letting others touch them&nbsp;– it may help to ensure your nails are kept clean and short\n- avoid contact with newborn babies, preparing food, playing contact sports, or going to the gym&nbsp;– until the risk of infection has passed\n- wash your hands frequently&nbsp;– particularly after touching infected skin\n- washable toys should also be washed&nbsp;– wipe non-washable soft toys thoroughly with a cloth that has been wrung out in detergent and warm water and allowed to dry completely\nIf you think that the infection has spread to someone else, make sure they&#8217;re seen by a pharmacist as soon as possible.\nTo&nbsp;reduce the risk of impetigo returning, make sure any cuts, scratches or bites are kept clean. Ensure any condition that causes broken skin, such as eczema, is treated promptly.\nIf you develop impetigo frequently, your doctor may suggest taking a swab from around your nose to see if you carry staphylococcal bacteria. These bacteria can live in the noses of some people without causing problems, although they can lead to impetigo if they infect broken skin nearby.\nIf you&#8217;re found to carry these bacteria, you may be prescribed an antiseptic nasal cream to apply several times a day for 5 to 10 days in an attempt to clear the bacteria and reduce the chances of impetigo recurring.\nComplications of impetigo are rare, but they can sometimes occur and can be serious. Tell your pharmacist if you have impetigo and your symptoms change or get worse.\nSome complications associated with impetigo include:\n- cellulitis – an infection of the deeper layers of the skin and underlying tissue\n- scarlet fever – a rare bacterial infection that causes a fine, pink rash across the body\n- guttate&nbsp;psoriasis&nbsp;–&nbsp;a non-infectious skin condition that can develop in children and teenagers after a bacterial infection\n- septicaemia (a type of sepsis)&nbsp;– a bacterial infection of the blood\n- Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS)&nbsp;–&nbsp;a serious skin condition that looks like the skin has been scalded with boiling water\n- post-streptococcal&nbsp;glomerulonephritis&nbsp;– an infection of the small blood vessels in the kidneys\nIn very rare cases,&nbsp;impetigo may lead to some scarring, particularly if you scratch at the blisters, crusts or sores\nImpetigo does not cause any symptoms until 4 to 10 days after you first become infected. This means that people can easily pass the infection on to others without realising it.\nThere are 2 main types of impetigo, known as non-bullous and bullous impetigo, which have different symptoms. Most people with impetigo have the non-bullous type.\nThe symptoms of non-bullous impetigo begin with the appearance of red sores – usually around the nose and mouth but other areas of the face and the limbs can also be affected.\nThe sores quickly burst leaving behind thick, golden crusts typically around 2cm across. The appearance of these crusts is sometimes likened to cornflakes stuck to the skin.\nAfter the crusts dry, they leave a red mark that usually heals without scarring. The time it takes for the redness to disappear can vary between a few days and a few weeks.\nThe sores are not painful, but they may be itchy. It is important not to touch, or scratch, the sores because this can spread the infection to other parts of your body, and to other people.\nOther symptoms, such as a high temperature (fever) and swollen glands, are rare but can occur in more severe cases.\nThe symptoms of bullous impetigo begin with the appearance of fluid-filled blisters (bullae) which usually occur on the trunk (the central part of the body between the waist and neck) or on the arms and legs. The blisters are usually about 1cm to 2cm across.\nThe blisters may quickly spread, before bursting after several days to leave a yellow crust that usually heals without leaving any scarring.\nThe blisters may be painful and the area of skin surrounding them may be itchy. As with non-bullous impetigo, it is important that you do not touch or scratch the affected areas of the skin.\nSymptoms of fever and swollen glands are more common in cases of bullous impetigo.\nImpetigo occurs when the skin becomes infected with bacteria, usually either Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes.\nThese bacteria can infect the skin in 2 ways:\n- through a break in otherwise healthy skin, such as&nbsp;a cut, insect bite or other injury – this is known as primary impetigo\n- through skin damaged by another underlying skin condition, such as head lice, scabies or eczema – this is known as secondary impetigo\nThe bacteria can be spread easily through close contact with someone who has the infection, such as through direct physical contact, or by sharing towels or flannels.\nAs the condition does not cause any symptoms until 4 to 10 days after initial exposure to the bacteria, it is often easily spread to others unintentionally.\nImpetigo stops being infectious after 48 hours of treatment starting or after the sores have stopped blistering or crusting.\nIn addition to the situations mentioned above, there are a number of other factors that can increase your chances of developing impetigo. These include:\n- being a child – impetigo is thought to be more common in children because their immune system has not yet fully developed and because they tend to spend time in places where the infection can easily be spread, such as schools and nurseries\n- having diabetes\n- being a carrier of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria – these bacteria can live in the noses of some people without causing problems, but they can sometimes cause impetigo if they get into damaged skin nearby\n- warm and humid weather – impetigo tends to be more common during the summer months in the UK, possibly because the warm and moist weather is a better environment for the bacteria to grow and/or because the skin is more likely to be exposed to insect bites and cuts at this time of year\n- having a weakened immune system, either due to a condition such as HIV or a treatment such as chemotherapy\nImpetigo isn&#8217;t usually serious and often clears up without treatment after 2 to 3 weeks.\nTreatment is often recommended as it can help clear up the infection in around 7 to 10 days and reduce the risk of the infection being passed on to others.\nIf impetigo is confirmed, it can usually be effectively treated with antibiotics.\nIf the infection is being caused by an underlying skin condition, such as eczema, this may also need to be treated.\nFor mild cases of impetigo that cover a small area, antibiotic cream is often recommended. This usually needs to be applied 3 or 4 times a day for 7 days.\nBefore applying&nbsp;the cream, wash any&nbsp;affected areas of skin with warm, soapy water and try to clean off any crusts that have developed.\nTo reduce the risk of spreading the infection, it&#8217;s also important that you&nbsp;wash your hands immediately after applying the cream or, if available, wear latex gloves while applying the cream.\nSide effects of antibiotic cream can include:\n- irritation\n- redness\n- itchiness in the area where the cream is applied\nIf symptoms haven&#8217;t improved&nbsp;after seven days of starting treatment,&nbsp;ask your pharmacist about other possible treatment options.\nAntibiotic tablets may be prescribed if the infection is more severe and widespread, or if the symptoms don&#8217;t improve after using antibiotic cream. These usually need to be taken 2 to 4 times a day for 7 days.\nIf a course of oral antibiotics is prescribed for you or your child, it&#8217;s very important that the course is finished even if the symptoms clear up before you&#8217;ve taken&nbsp;all&nbsp;the tablets.&nbsp;\nCommon side effects of oral antibiotics include:\n- feeling sick\n- vomiting\n- diarrhoea\nSpeak to your pharmacist if your symptoms haven&#8217;t improved after 7 days of treatment with antibiotic tablets.\nFurther tests are usually only required in cases where the infection is severe or widespread, doesn&#8217;t respond to treatment, or keeps recurring.\nIn these circumstances, your GP may refer you to a dermatologist (skin specialist) for further tests or they may take a swab&nbsp;of the affected skin&nbsp;themselves for testing.\nThis can help to rule out or confirm other skin conditions that may be responsible for your symptoms and can detect whether you carry one of the types of bacteria responsible for the&nbsp;infection inside your nose.\nIf your doctor thinks you may keep getting&nbsp;impetigo because you naturally have these bacteria inside your nose, they may prescribe you an antiseptic nasal cream to try to clear the bacteria.\nComplications of impetigo are rare, but they can sometimes occur and can be serious. Tell your pharmacist if you have impetigo and your symptoms change or get worse.\nCellulitis occurs when the infection spreads to a deeper layer of skin. It can cause symptoms of red, inflamed skin with fever and pain. It can usually be treated with antibiotics, and&nbsp;painkillers can be used to relieve pain.\nGuttate&nbsp;psoriasis is a non-infectious skin condition that can develop in children and teenagers after a bacterial infection. It is usually more common after a throat infection, but some cases have been linked to impetigo.\nGuttate psoriasis causes small, red, droplet-shaped, scaly patches on the chest, arms, legs and scalp.\nCreams can be used to control the symptoms and in some cases&nbsp;the condition will disappear completely after a few weeks.\nScarlet fever is a rare bacterial infection that causes a fine, pink rash across the body. Associated symptoms of infection, such as nausea, pain and vomiting, are also common. The condition is usually treated with antibiotics.\nScarlet fever is not usually serious but it is contagious. Therefore, it&#8217;s important to isolate an infected child and avoid close physical contact. Keep your child away from school and other people until&nbsp;they have&nbsp;been taking&nbsp;antibiotics for at least 24 hours.\nSepticaemia (a type of sepsis) is a bacterial infection of the blood. It can cause:\n- diarrhoea\n- cold, clammy skin\n- a high temperature (fever)\n- rapid breathing\n- vomiting\n- low blood pressure&nbsp;(hypotension)\n- confusion\n- feeling faint and dizzy\n- losing consciousness\nSepticaemia is a life-threatening condition and requires immediate treatment with antibiotics in hospital.\nIn rare cases, impetigo may lead to some scarring. However, this is more often the result of someone scratching at blisters, crusts or sores. The blisters and crusts themselves should not leave a scar if left to heal.\nThe red mark left after the crusts and blisters clear up should also disappear by itself. The time it takes for the redness to disappear can vary between a few days and a few weeks.\nStaphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) is a serious skin condition in which one of the causes of impetigo – Staphylococcus bacteria – releases a toxin (poison) that damages the skin.\nThis leads to extensive blistering that looks like the skin has been scalded with boiling water.\nOther symptoms of SSSS include:\n- painful skin\n- a high temperature (fever)\n- large areas of skin peeling off or falling away\n- redness of the skin which usually spreads across the entire body\nSSSS usually requires immediate treatment in hospital with antibiotics given directly into a vein (intravenously).\nPost-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is an infection of the small blood vessels in the kidneys. It&#8217;s a very rare complication of impetigo.\nThe symptoms of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis include:\n- a change in the colour of your urine to a reddish-brown or cola colour\n- swelling of the abdomen (tummy),&nbsp;face, eyes, feet and ankles\n- a rise in blood pressure\n- visible&nbsp;blood in your urine\n- a reduction in the amount of urine you would normally produce\nPeople with post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis will usually require immediate hospital treatment so their blood pressure can be carefully monitored and controlled.\nPost-streptococcal glomerulonephritis can be fatal in adults, although deaths in children are rare.\nAs impetigo is a highly contagious condition, it is important to take precautions to reduce the risk of the infection spreading.\nTo help to prevent the spread of the infection to other people or to other areas of the body you should:\n- stay away from work, school, nursery or playgroup until the sores have dried up, blistered or crusted over, or until 48 hours after starting treatment\n- not share flannels, sheets or towels with anyone who has impetigo, and wash them at a high temperature after use\n- wash the sores with soap and water, and cover them loosely with a gauze bandage or clothing if possible\n- avoid touching the sores, or letting others touch them, whenever possible\n- not scratch the affected areas – it may help to ensure your or your child&#8217;s nails are kept clean and short to reduce the risk of further damage caused by scratching\n- avoid contact with newborn babies, preparing food, playing contact sports, or going to the gym until the risk of infection has passed (when the rash has crusted over, or after at least 48 hours of treatment with antibiotics)\n- wash your hands frequently, particularly after touching infected skin\n- washable toys should also be washed, and wipe non-washable soft toys thoroughly with a cloth that has been wrung out in detergent and warm water and allowed to dry completely\nIf you think that the infection has spread to someone else, make sure they&nbsp;contact their pharmacist as soon as possible.\nTo&nbsp;reduce the risk of impetigo returning, make sure any cuts, scratches or bites are kept clean, and ensure any condition that causes broken skin, such as eczema, is treated promptly.\nIf you develop impetigo frequently, your doctor may suggest taking a swab from around your nose to see if you carry staphylococcal bacteria&nbsp;inside your nose. These bacteria can live in the noses of some people without causing problems, although they can lead to impetigo if they infected broken skin nearby.\nIf you are found to carry these bacteria, you may be prescribed an antiseptic nasal cream to apply several times a day for 5 to 10 days in an attempt to clear the bacteria and reduce the chances of impetigo recurring."

        "disease": "Indigestion",
        "description": "Indigestion can be pain or discomfort in your upper abdomen (dyspepsia) or burning pain behind the breastbone (heartburn).\nDyspepsia and&nbsp;heartburn&nbsp;may occur together or on their own. Symptoms usually appear soon after eating or drinking.\nCommon associated symptoms include:\n- feeling full or bloated\n- feeling sick (nausea)\n- belching\n- bringing up (regurgitating) fluid or food into the gullet (oesophagus)\nIndigestion is a common problem that affects many people, but in most cases it&#8217;s mild and only occurs occasionally.\nRead more about the&nbsp;symptoms of indigestion.\nIndigestion&nbsp;may be&nbsp;caused by stomach acid coming into contact with the sensitive, protective lining of the digestive system (mucosa). The stomach acid breaks down the lining, leading to irritation and inflammation, which can be painful.\nThe majority of people with indigestion don&#8217;t have inflammation in their digestive system. Therefore, their symptoms are thought to be caused by increased sensitivity of the mucosa (to acidity or stretching).\nIn most cases indigestion is related to eating, although it can be&nbsp;triggered by other factors such as smoking, drinking, alcohol, pregnancy, stress&nbsp;or taking certain medications.\nRead more about the&nbsp;causes of indigestion.\nMost people are able to&nbsp;treat indigestion with simple changes to their&nbsp;diet and lifestyle, or with a number of different medications, such as antacids.\nRead more about the&nbsp;treatment of indigestion.\nVery rarely, a serious underlying health condition is the cause of indigestion. If this is suspected, then further investigation such as an endoscopy will be required.\nIf you have symptoms of indigestion you can get treatment directly from a pharmacy. Find your local pharmacy on Scotland&#8217;s Service Directory.\nMost people will not need to seek medical advice for their indigestion. However, your pharmacist may advise you see your GP if you&nbsp;have recurring indigestion and any of the following apply:\n- you are 55 years old or over\n- you have lost a lot of weight without meaning to\n- you have increasing&nbsp;difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)\n- you have persistent vomiting\n- you have&nbsp;iron deficiency anaemia\n- you have a lump in your stomach\n- you have blood in your vomit or&nbsp;blood in your stools\nThis is because these symptoms&nbsp;may be a sign of an underlying health condition, such as a&nbsp;stomach ulcer&nbsp;or&nbsp;stomach cancer. You may need to be referred for an endoscopy&nbsp;to rule out any serious cause.\nAn endoscopy is a procedure where the inside of the body is examined using an endoscope (a thin, flexible tube that has a light and camera on one end).\nSevere indigestion can cause long-term problems with parts of your digestive tract, such as scarring of the oesophagus or the passage from your stomach. Read more about the possible&nbsp;complications of severe indigestion.\nThe main symptom of indigestion is pain or a feeling of discomfort in your upper abdomen (dyspepsia). People often experience the associated feeling of burning behind the breastbone (heartburn), but this may occur on its own.\nThese symptoms&nbsp;usually come on soon after eating or drinking, although there can sometimes be a delay between eating a meal and experiencing indigestion.\nHeartburn&nbsp;is caused by acid that passes from your stomach into your gullet (oesophagus).\nIf you have indigestion, you may also have symptoms such as:\n- feeling uncomfortably full or heavy\n- belching or&nbsp;flatulence(passing wind)\n- bringing&nbsp;food or fluid&nbsp;back up from your stomach (reflux)\n- bloating\n- feeling sick (nausea)\n- vomiting\nIndigestion has a number of different causes, but it&#8217;s rarely due to a serious, underlying condition.\nIt&#8217;s normal for your stomach to produce acid, but sometimes this acid can irritate the lining of your stomach, the top part of your bowel (duodenum) or your gullet (oesophagus).\nThis irritation can be painful and often causes a burning sensation. Indigestion may also be due to the lining of your digestive system being overly sensitive to acid, or the &#8216;stretching&#8217; caused by eating.\nIndigestion can also be triggered or made worse by other factors.\nYou may have indigestion if you take certain types of medication. Some medicines, such as nitrates (taken to widen your blood vessels) relax the oesophageal sphincter (ring of muscle between your oesophagus and your stomach), which allows acid to leak back up.\nOther medicines, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), can affect your digestive tract and cause&nbsp;indigestion.\nDo&nbsp;not take NSAIDs, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, if you have stomach problems, such as a&nbsp;stomach ulcer, or have had this in the past. Children under 16 years of age should not take aspirin.\nNever stop taking a prescribed medication unless you are&nbsp;told to do so by your GP or another qualified healthcare professional who is responsible for your care.\nIf you are very overweight, you are more likely to experience indigestion because of increased pressure inside your stomach (abdomen).&nbsp;\nThe increased pressure, particularly after a large meal, may lead to acid reflux into the oesophagus.\nIf you regularly experience feelings of stress or anxiety, this can contribute to symptoms of indigestion.\nRead&nbsp;some relaxation tips to relieve stress.\nA hernia occurs when an internal part of the body, such as an organ, pushes through a weakness in the surrounding muscle or tissue wall.\nA&nbsp;hiatus hernia&nbsp;occurs when part of your stomach pushes up into your diaphragm (the sheet of muscle under your lungs).&nbsp;It may partially block refluxed stomach&nbsp;acid clearing from your oesophagus, leading to heartburn.\nHelicobacter infection is very common. It may lead to stomach ulcers or, rarely, stomach cancer. In most cases, however, it&nbsp;does not cause any symptoms at all.\nSome people may get bouts of indigestion from helicobacter infection and, in these cases, getting rid of the bug with antibiotics (eradication) will help. However, many cases of indigestion are not caused by helicobacter, and in these cases eradication will not get rid of symptoms.\nGastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)&nbsp;is a common condition and one of the main causes of recurring indigestion. It&#8217;s caused by acid reflux, which&nbsp;occurs when the oesophageal sphincter fails to prevent stomach acid from moving back up into your oesophagus.\nA little bit of acid reflux is normal and rarely cause any symptoms. It becomes GORD when large amounts of reflux occur, and the sensitive lining of your oesophagus may get inflamed by repeated irritation from stomach acid. This can lead to heartburn, the sensation of regurgitation or painful swallowing.\nA&nbsp;stomach ulcer&nbsp;is an open sore that develops on the inside lining of your stomach (a gastric ulcer) or small intestine (a duodenal ulcer). If you have a&nbsp;stomach ulcer, you may have indigestion as a symptom.\nStomach ulcers form when stomach acid damages the lining in your stomach or duodenum wall. In most cases, the lining is damaged as a result of an H pylori infection.\nIn rare cases, recurring bouts of indigestion can be a symptom of&nbsp;stomach cancer.\nCancer cells in your stomach break down the protective lining, allowing acid to come into contact with your stomach wall.\nFor most people, indigestion (dyspepsia) is mild and infrequent, and does not require treatment from a healthcare professional.\nHowever, if you have indigestion regularly, or if it causes you severe pain or discomfort, see your pharmacist.&nbsp;\nThey will ask about your indigestion symptoms, as well as:\n- any other symptoms you have – which&nbsp;may indicate an underlying health condition\n- any medication you are taking – as some medications can cause indigestion\n- your lifestyle – as some lifestyle factors, such as smoking, drinking alcohol or being overweight, can cause indigestion&nbsp;\nDepending on the type of indigestion symptoms you have, your pharmacist may recommend you see your GP to investigate your condition further. This is because indigestion can sometimes be a symptom of an underlying condition or health problem, such as a Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) bacterial infection.\nYou may be referred to hospital to have an endoscopy.\nAn endoscopy is a procedure used to examine the inside of your body using an endoscope – a thin, flexible tube, about the width of your little finger, with a light and a camera on one end. The camera is used to relay images of the inside of your body to a&nbsp;TV monitor.\nAn endoscopy is not often needed to diagnose indigestion, but your GP may suggest that you have one if:\n- they need to examine the inside of your abdomen in more detail\n- you have had treatment for indigestion that has not worked\n- you have any serious symptoms of indigestion\nTaking certain medicines for indigestion can hide some of the problems that could otherwise be spotted during an endoscopy. Therefore, for at least two weeks before your endoscopy, you will need to stop taking proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2-receptor antagonists.\nRead more about&nbsp;treatments for indigestion.\nYour GP may also recommend changing other medications that may be causing your indigestion. However, only stop taking medication if you are advised to do so by your GP or another healthcare professional responsible for your care.&nbsp;\nIf your GP thinks that your symptoms may be due to an infection with H pylori bacteria, you may need to have a test for it, such as:\n- a stool antigen test – a pea-sized stool (faeces) sample will be tested for H pylori bacteria\n- a breath test\n- a&nbsp;blood test– a blood sample will be tested for antibodies to H pylori bacteria (antibodies are proteins produced by the body to fight infection)\nAntibiotics and PPIs can affect the results of a urea breath test or a stool antigen test. Therefore, these tests may need to be delayed until two weeks after you last used a PPI, and 4 weeks after you last used an antibiotic.\nIf your GP thinks that your indigestion symptoms may be caused by another underlying medical condition, you may need to have some further tests to rule this out.\nFor example, abdominal pain and discomfort can also be caused by conditions affecting the bile ducts in your liver. Your bile ducts are a series of tubes that carry bile (fluid used by the digestive system to break down fats) from the liver to the gallbladder (a pouch that holds bile) and the bowel. If your GP thinks that you may have such a condition, they may suggest you have a liver function test, which is a type of blood test used to assess how well your liver is working.\nYou may also need to have an abdominal ultrasound. An&nbsp;ultrasound scan&nbsp;uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your body.\nTreatment for indigestion (dyspepsia) will vary, depending on what is causing it and how severe your symptoms are.\nIf you have been diagnosed with an underlying health condition, you may want to read our information on:\n- treating gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)\n- treating a&nbsp;stomach ulcer\nIf you only have indigestion occasionally, you may not need to see your pharmacist or GP for treatment. It may be possible to ease your symptoms by making a few simple changes to your diet and lifestyle, summarised below.\nBeing overweight puts more pressure on your stomach, making it easier for stomach acid to be pushed back up into your gullet (oesophagus). This is known as acid reflux, and is one of the most common causes of indigestion.\nIf you are overweight or obese, it is important to lose weight safely and steadily through regular exercise and by eating a healthy, balanced diet. Read advice on&nbsp;losing weight.\nIf you smoke, the chemicals you inhale in cigarette smoke may contribute to your indigestion. These chemicals can cause the ring of muscle that separates your oesophagus from your stomach to relax, causing acid reflux.\nRead more about quitting smoking, or speak to your GP or pharmacist. You can also phone the Quit Your Way Scotland service on 0800 84 84 84.\nMake a note of any particular food or drink that seems to make your indigestion worse, and avoid these if possible. This may mean:\n- eating less rich, spicy and fatty foods\n- cutting down on drinks that contain caffeine – such as tea, coffee and cola\n- avoiding or cutting down on alcohol\nIf you tend to experience indigestion symptoms at night, avoid eating for three to four hours before you go to bed. Going to bed with a full stomach means there is an increased risk that acid in your stomach will be forced up into your oesophagus while you are lying down.\nWhen you go to bed, use a couple of pillows to prop your head and shoulders up or, ideally,&nbsp;raise the head of your bed by a few inches by putting something underneath the mattress. The slight slope that is created should help to prevent stomach acid moving up into your oesophagus while you are asleep.\nIf you regularly experience feelings of stress or anxiety, this can contribute to symptoms of indigestion.\nRead some&nbsp;relaxation tips to relieve stress.\nYour pharmacist may recommend making changes to your current medication if they think it could be contributing to your indigestion.\nAs long as it is safe to do so, you may need to stop taking certain medications, such as aspirin or ibuprofen. Where required, your pharmacist may advise you see your GP to prescribe an alternative medication that will not cause indigestion. However, never stop taking any medication without consulting your pharmacist or GP first.\nIf you have indigestion that requires immediate relief, your pharmacist can advise you about the best way to treat this. As well as lifestyle changes and reviewing your current medication, your GP may prescribe or recommend:\n- antacid medicines\n- alginates\nAntacids are a type of medicine that can provide immediate relief for mild to moderate symptoms of indigestion. They work by neutralising the acid in your stomach (making it less acidic), so that it no longer irritates the lining of your digestive system.\nAntacids are available in tablet and liquid form. You can buy them over the counter from most pharmacies without a prescription.\nThe effect of an antacid only lasts for a few hours at a time, so you may need to take more than one dose. Always follow the instructions on the packet to ensure you do not take too much.\nIt is best to take antacids when you are expecting symptoms of indigestion, or when they start to occur, such as:\n- after meals\n- at bedtime\nThis is because antacids stay in your stomach for longer at these times and have more time to work. For example, if you take an antacid at the same time as eating a meal, it can work for up to three hours. In comparison, if you take an antacid on an empty stomach, it may only work for 20 to 60 minutes.\nRead more&nbsp;about&nbsp;antacids, including possible interactions with other medicines and side effects.\nSome antacids also contain a medicine&nbsp;called an alginate. This helps relieve indigestion caused by acid reflux.\nAcid reflux occurs when stomach acid leaks back up into your oesophagus and irritates its lining. Alginates&nbsp;form a foam barrier that floats on the surface of your stomach contents, keeping stomach acid in your stomach and away from your oesophagus.\nYour pharmacist may suggest that you take an antacid that contains an alginate if you experience symptoms of acid reflux or if you have GORD.\nTake antacids containing alginates after eating, because this helps the medicine stay in your stomach for longer. If you take alginates on an empty stomach, they will leave your stomach too quickly to be effective.\nIf you have indigestion that is persistent or recurring, treatment with antacids and alginates may not be effective enough to control your symptoms. Your pharmacist may recommend a different type of medication, which will&nbsp;be prescribed at the lowest possible dose to control your symptoms. Possible medications include:\n- proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)\n- H2-receptor antagonists\nYour pharmacist may advise you to see your GP who may also test you for the Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) bacteria (see Indigestion – diagnosis) and prescribe treatment for this if necessary.\nPPIs restrict the acid produced in your stomach.\nThe medication is&nbsp;taken as tablets and if you are over 18, you can buy some types of PPIs over the counter in pharmacies, but these should only be used for short-term treatment. PPIs may enhance the effect of certain medicines. If you are prescribed a PPI, your progress will be monitored if you are also taking other medicines, such as:\n- warfarin – a medicine that stops the blood clotting\n- phenytoin – a medicine to treat epilepsy\nIf your ingestion is persistent, your pharmacist might advise you to see your GP.\nIf your GP refers you for an endoscopy (a procedure that allows a surgeon to see inside your abdomen), you will need to stop taking a PPI at least 14 days before the procedure. This is because PPIs can hide some of the problems that would otherwise be spotted during the endoscopy.\nPPIs can sometimes cause side effects. However, they are usually mild and reversible. These side effects may include:\n- headaches\n- diarrhoea\n- constipation\n- feeling sick (nausea)\n- vomiting\n- flatulence\n- stomach pain\n- dizziness\n- skin rashes\nH2-receptor antagonists are another type of medication that your pharmacist or GP may suggest if antacids, alginates and PPIs have not been effective in controlling your indigestion. There are four H2-receptor antagonists:\n- cimetidine&nbsp;\n- famotidine&nbsp;\n- nizatidine&nbsp;\n- ranitidine&nbsp;\nThese medicines work by lowering the acidity level in your stomach.\nYour GP may prescribe any one of these four H2-receptor antagonists, although ranitidine is available from pharmacies under the Pharmacy First Scotland service. H2-receptor antagonists are usually taken in tablet form.\nAs with PPIs, you will need to stop taking H2-receptor antagonists at least 14 days before having an endoscopy if this has been arranged through your GP. This is&nbsp;because they can hide some of the problems that could otherwise be spotted during the endoscopy.\nIf your indigestion symptoms are caused by an infection with H pylori bacteria, you will need to have treatment to clear the infection from your stomach. This should help relieve your indigestion, because the H pylori bacteria will no longer be increasing the amount of acid in your stomach.\nH pylori infection is usually treated using triple therapy (treatment with three different medications). Your GP will prescribe a course of treatment containing:\n- two different antibiotics (medicines to treat infections that are caused by bacteria)\n- a PPI\nYou will need to take these medicines twice a day for seven days. You must follow the dosage instructions closely to ensure that the triple therapy is effective.\nIn up to 85% of cases, one course of triple therapy is effective in clearing an H pylori infection. However, you may need to have more than one course of treatment if it does not clear the infection the first time.\nIn most cases, indigestion (dyspepsia) is mild and only occurs occasionally. However, severe indigestion can cause complications, some of which are outlined below.\nIndigestion is often caused by acid reflux, which occurs when stomach acid leaks back up into your gullet (oesophagus) and irritates its lining. If this irritation builds up over time, it can cause your oesophagus to become scarred. The scarring can eventually lead to your oesophagus becoming narrow and constricted (known as oesophageal stricture).\nIf you have oesophageal stricture, you may have symptoms such as:\n- difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)\n- food that becomes lodged in your throat\n- chest pain\nOesophageal stricture is often treated using surgery to widen your oesophagus.\nLike oesophageal stricture, pyloric stenosis is caused by long-term irritation of the lining of your digestive system from stomach acid.\nPyloric stenosis occurs when the passage between your stomach and your small intestine (known as the pylorus) becomes scarred and narrowed. This causes vomiting and prevents any food you eat from being properly digested.\nIn most cases, pyloric stenosis is treated using surgery to return the pylorus to its proper width.\nRepeated episodes of&nbsp;gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)&nbsp;can lead to changes in the cells lining your lower oesophagus. This is a condition known as Barrett’s oesophagus.\nIt is estimated that 1 in 10 people with GORD will develop Barrett’s oesophagus. Most cases of Barrett’s oesophagus first develop in people aged 50 to 70 years old. The average age at diagnosis is 62.\nBarrett’s oesophagus does not usually cause noticeable symptoms other than those associated with GORD.\nThe concern is that Barrett’s oesophagus is a pre-cancerous condition. This means that while changes in the cells are not cancerous, there is a small risk they could develop into cancer in the future. This would then trigger the onset of oesophageal cancer."

        "disease": "Ingrown toenail",
        "description": "An ingrown toenail develops when the sides of the toenail grow into the surrounding skin.\nAn ingrown toenail often affects the big toe, either on one or both sides. The nail curls and pierces the skin which becomes red, swollen and tender.\nOther possible symptoms include:\n- pain if pressure is placed on the toe\n- inflammation of the skin at the end of the toe\n- a build-up of fluid (oedema) in the area surrounding the toe\n- an overgrowth of skin around the affected toe (hypertrophy)\n- bleeding\n- white or yellow pus coming from the affected area\nIf you have an ingrown toenail, you can ask a pharmacist about:\n- treatments to help ease the pain and prevent an infection\n- whether you need to see a GP\nA number of things can cause an ingrown toenail to develop, including:\n- badly cut toenails – cutting your toenails too short, or cutting the edges, will encourage the skin to fold over your nail and the nail to grow into the skin\n- wearing tight-fitting shoes, socks or tights – this places pressure on the skin around your toenail and the skin may be pierced if it&#8217;s pressed on to your toenail\n- sweaty feet – if the skin around your toenails is soft, it&#8217;s easier for your nail to pierce it and embed itself within it\n- injury – for example, stubbing your toe can sometimes cause an ingrown toenail to develop\n- natural shape of the nail – the sides of curved or fan-shaped toenails are more likely to press into the skin surrounding the nail\nA&nbsp;fungal nail infection&nbsp;can cause your toenail to thicken or widen.\nLeft untreated, an ingrown toenail can become infected. It’s important that you:\n\n\nSurgery may be recommended if your toenail doesn&#8217;t improve. Depending on the severity of your symptoms, this may involve removing part or all of your toenail.\nPartial nail avulsion removes part of your toenail and is the most common operation for treating ingrown toenails. It&#8217;s about 98% effective.\nA&nbsp;local anaesthetic&nbsp;is used to numb your toe and the edges of your toenail are cut away. A chemical called phenol is applied to the affected area to prevent the nail growing back and becoming ingrown in the future.\nA course of&nbsp;antibiotics may be prescribed if your nail is infected, and any pus will be drained away.\nTotal nail avulsion completely removes your toenail. This may be necessary if your nail is thick and pressing into the skin surrounding your toe. After your toenail has been removed, you’ll have an indentation where your nail used to be. However, it&#8217;s perfectly safe for you not to have a toenail.\nAfter toenail surgery, your toe will be wrapped in a sterile bandage. This will help stem any bleeding and prevent infection. Rest your foot and keep it raised for 1&nbsp;to 2&nbsp;days after the operation.\nTo help reduce the pain, you may need to take a painkiller like paracetamol. You may also need to wear soft or open-toed shoes for the first few days after surgery.\nTaking care of your feet will help prevent foot problems like ingrown toenails. It’s important to cut your toenails properly (straight across, not at an angle or down the edges).\nWash your feet every day, dry them thoroughly and use foot moisturiser. You can also use a foot file or pumice stone to remove hard or dead skin.\nWearing shoes that fit properly will help to ensure your feet remain healthy. You should also change your socks (or tights) every day.\nVisit your GP practice or a podiatrist as soon as possible if you develop problems with your feet."

        "disease": "Infertility",
        "description": "Infertility is when you are unable to become pregnant.\nNot all of the information on this page will be relevant for everyone. All couples, including same-sex couples and couples where one or both partners are trans or non-binary, can access NHS fertility services if they meet the treatment access criteria.\n80% of women under 40 years of age will naturally become pregnant within a year if they have regular unprotected sex. For some people it can be more difficult. For couples, infertility is when you or your partner are unable to get pregnant after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sex.\nAbout 1 in 7 of couples struggle to become pregnant. Not all of these couples require fertility treatment as some couples will get pregnant naturally.\nSome couples need extra help to be able to have a baby. For example:\n- drugs to help release eggs\n- IVF/ICSI\n- use of donated eggs or sperm\n- more rarely, treatment with a surrogate\nInfertility and trying for a baby can bring challenges that might be overwhelming at times. There are charities that provide support, advice and information such as Fertility Alliance and Fertility Network UK. The Human Fertility and Embryology Authority also provides information for patients.\nFertility is affected by various factors, including:\n- the health of your reproductive organs\n- hormones\n- age (as you age fertility decreases)\nLifestyle changes can improve your fertility, such as:\n- maintaining a healthy weight (or BMI)\n- stopping smoking\n- not drinking alcohol\n- reducing stress and anxiety\nThere are things you can do to reduce stress and anxiety such as:\n- gentle exercise – like going for a walk or cycle\n- eating a healthy, balanced diet\n- trying to get 7 to 8 hours of sleep a night\n- yoga, breathing exercises and meditation\nFurther information about your mental health and wellbeing\nSome causes of infertility include:\n- semen quality or no sperm in an ejaculation – this affects about 1 in 3 couples who are seeking fertility treatment\n- lack of ovulation (releasing an egg) or ovulatory dysfunction – a sign of this may be having irregular periods\n- blocked fallopian tubes (the tubes connecting the ovary to the womb) – this prevents the sperm getting to the egg or a fertilised eggs getting to the womb\n- genetics, such as Klinefelters Syndrome\nSometimes the causes of infertility are unknown.\nYou may feel worried about speaking to your GP, but infertility is common and they can provide support.\nWhen you speak to your doctor about your fertility they will take a medical history.\nThey may carry out some of the following tests on you and your partner, for example:\n- semen analysis – you&#8217;ll produce a semen sample to be analysed by a laboratory\n- hormone analysis – you&#8217;ll have a blood test which will then be sent for analysis\nYour doctor will discuss your results with you and you can ask any questions that you might have.\nThere are lifestyle changes that might help improve your fertility, as well as your health and the health of any future pregnancy.\nFurther information about preconception health\nYour healthcare professional will discuss your treatment options with you and you can ask any questions that you might have.\nOvulation induction uses hormone therapy to help your ovaries to release an egg. It&#8217;s often the treatment used for patients with PCOS.\nSome people will have surgery to help treat or remove areas of endometriosis.\nFor IVF, fertility hormones are used to stimulate the ovaries to produce eggs. The eggs are collected (removed from the body) and mixed with sperm in a laboratory. If an egg is fertilised by the sperm this becomes an embryo which is then transferred into the womb.\nIVF is carried out when the sperm quality is considered to be normal.\nICSI is like IVF but is used when the sperm is lower quality. The sperm is injected into the egg outside of the body.\nIn some cases, there may not be sperm in the sample. This could be because of a blockage or a genetic problem. Sperm may be collected directly from the testicles (balls) using minor surgery. The sperm is then used with ICSI.\nIUI is a procedure where sperm is introduced directly into the womb using medical equipment. IUI is commonly used by people who are using donated sperm in their treatment.\nOptions can include:\n- using donor sperm with IUI\n- using donor eggs with IVF or ICSI\n- using donor sperm with IVF or ICSI\nA surrogate may also be needed if neither person is able to carry a pregnancy.\nTreatment options are available for all couples, including non-binary or transgender people, as long as they meet the NHS IVF treatment access criteria.\nTrans and non-binary people who are unable to get pregnant because they’ve had gender reassignment (including surgery) will still be able to access treatment if all other access criteria are met.\nFor more information, visit the HFEA website or contact your GP for a referral to fertility services to discuss options.\nNot all patients will be eligible for NHS treatments. For example, if you and your partner already have a child together you will not be eligible for IVF or ICSI."

        "description": "Inherited heart conditions, sometimes referred to as inherited cardiac conditions (ICC), are a group of heart conditions that are passed on through families. They affect around&nbsp;1 in 250 people worldwide&nbsp;and can affect people of all ages.\nThe body has over 20,000 genes. Genes are made up of DNA and are like instructions for the body.\nThere are 2 copies of each gene in your body. One is inherited from your mum and one is from your dad. Inherited heart conditions are caused when there’s a change in one or more of your genes. This is known as a gene variant.\nIf one of your parents has a gene variant, there’s a 50% chance it will be passed on to you (inherited). If you do inherit the gene variant, there’s also a 50% chance you could pass it on to each of your children.\nIf you do not inherit the gene variant, you can’t pass it on to your children. Most inherited heart conditions follow this pattern.\nEach person is affected by each gene variant differently. This means you could have a gene variant and not have any symptoms. But, you can still pass the gene variant on to your children and they may have symptoms.\nIf someone in your family is diagnosed with an inherited heart condition, or it’s thought they could have one, it’s important to create a family tree with a healthcare professional. This can help to identify if the same condition is present among more than one family member.\nIf you’re diagnosed with an inherited heart condition, your first-degree family members (parents, siblings and children) should be assessed for the same condition.\nAn inherited heart condition can cause symptoms like:\n- dizzy spells\n- blackouts, faints or fits (seizures)\n- palpitations\n- breathlessness\n- chest pain\nIt’s important to speak to your GP or a healthcare professional if you have had any of these symptoms.\nAn inherited heart condition can also cause cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death. As some affected people don’t have symptoms, this means that sometimes the first time a family is aware that they’re affected by an inherited heart condition is after a sudden cardiac death.\nThere are 3 main groups of inherited heart conditions:\nInherited cardiomyopathies affect the heart muscle. Examples include:\n- Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)\n- Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)\n- Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy\nInherited channelopathies affect the heart’s electrical system and heart rhythm. Examples include:\n- Long QT Syndrome\n- Brugada Syndrome\n- Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT)\nAortopathy can affect the aorta, which is the main artery in the body. Examples include:\n- Marfan Syndrome\n- Loeys-Dietz syndrome\nSudden Arrhythmic Death Syndrome (SADS)&nbsp;is when someone dies suddenly or unexpectedly with no clear cause.\nSADS can occur when there’s an abnormal heart rhythm, known as an arrhythmia. This causes a cardiac arrest where the heart stops beating.\nA cardiac arrest is a medical emergency –&nbsp;find out more about what to do in a heart emergency.\nCardiac Risk in the Young (CRY) has information on&nbsp;sudden cardiac death.\nThe process for testing for inherited heart conditions may differ from person to person. It will also be personalised to you and your family’s needs.\nTo begin the process, a specialist will ask questions about you and your family history. They may then refer you for heart tests, which can include:\n- an&nbsp;ECG (electrocardiogram)\n- an&nbsp;echocardiogram\n- a 24 hour heart monitor\n- an exercise tolerance test\n- a cardiac&nbsp;MRI scan\nEvery inherited heart condition is managed and treated differently. Treatments will be based on your symptoms and any test results.\nTreatments may include:\n- changes to your lifestyle\n- medication\n- pacemakers&nbsp;or implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs)\n- heart transplantation (in rare cases)\nGenetic services in Scotland are managed by specialist hospital doctors in 4 regional centres. These are:\n- Aberdeen –&nbsp;gram.clinicalgenetics@nhs.scot\n- Dundee –&nbsp;tay.clinicalgenetics@nhs.scot\n- Edinburgh –&nbsp;wgh.clinicalgenetics@nhslothian.scot.nhs.uk\n- Glasgow –&nbsp;ggc.wosicc@ggc.scot.nhs.uk\nThese regional services have access to:\n- specialist cardiologists\n- geneticists\n- specialist nursing\n- genetic counselling\nThese cardiac-genetic services link with the other hospitals in their regions.\nYou may need to visit your GP to get a referral to a specialist service.\nThe Network for Inherited Cardiac Conditions Scotland (NICCS) is a National Managed Clinical Network (NMCN). It was set up to help coordinate services for people with, or suspected of having, inherited heart conditions.\nNICCS is part of the NHS. It brings together experts from across Scotland and aims to improve services for inherited heart conditions. Those in the network include:\n- heart specialists\n- geneticists\n- genetic counsellors\n- pathologists\n- specialist nurses\n- public representatives\n- other experts\nThe&nbsp;NICCS website&nbsp;has resources for people affected by inherited heart conditions.

It&#8217;s particularly common in elderly people.\nIf you have insomnia, you might:\n- find it&nbsp;hard to fall asleep\n- lie awake at night\n- wake up several times during the night\n- wake up early in the morning and not be able to get back to sleep\n- not feel refreshed when you get up\n- feel tired and irritable during the day\n- have difficulty concentrating because you&#8217;re tired\nOccasional episodes of insomnia can come and go without causing any serious problems. But, some people can have insomnia for months or even years at a time.\nPersistent insomnia can have an impact on your quality of life. It can limit what you&#8217;re able to do during the day and affect your mood. It also can lead to relationship problems with friends, family and colleagues.\nEveryone needs different amounts of sleep.&nbsp;\nMost adults sleep for 7 to 9 hours a night. Children and babies may sleep for much longer than this, whereas older adults may sleep less. What&#8217;s important is whether you feel you get enough sleep, and whether your sleep is good quality.\nYou&#8217;re probably not getting enough good-quality sleep if:\n- you always feel tired throughout the day\n- tiredness is affecting your everyday life\nInsomnia can be triggered by many factors. It&#8217;s not always possible to identify a clear cause.\nThe most common causes of insomnia are:&nbsp;\n- stress, anxiety and depression&nbsp;\n- noise\n- a room that&#8217;s too hot or cold&nbsp;\n- uncomfortable bed\n- alcohol, caffeine or drugs\n- jet lag&nbsp;\n- shift work&nbsp;\nIf you feel unwell or think your sleep problems could be caused by medication please speak to your GP or pharmacist\nBecause the causes of insomnia vary, the treatments used can vary from person to person.\nInsomnia can often be treated by improving your sleep hygiene.\nTo improve your sleep hygiene, you need to look at both your sleep environment and your daily behaviours.\nIf you find you cannot fall asleep and you&#8217;re growing anxious about it, you should:\n- get up and go to a different room\n- do a relaxing activity, like reading or listening to music\n- try going to sleep again in around 20 minutes, or whenever you feel tired again\nYour GP will first try to identify and treat any underlying health condition that may be causing your sleep problems. If it&#8217;s possible to identify an underlying cause of your sleeping difficulties, treating this may be enough to return your sleep to normal.\nYou could try our&nbsp;sleep problems and insomnia self-help guide. It covers topics like:\n- symptom of a sleep problem\n- causes of a sleep problem\n- improving your sleep\n- calming a busy mind\nYou could try an online course like&nbsp;Sleepio.&nbsp;Sleepio is a digital sleep improvement&nbsp;programme based on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT.) It’s clinically proven to help address the root causes of poor sleep and insomnia.\nIf changing your sleeping habits doesn&#8217;t help, your GP may refer you for a type of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for people with insomnia. This is called CBT-I.\nCBT-I aims to change unhelpful thoughts and behaviours that contribute to insomnia. It&#8217;s an effective treatment for many people and can have long-lasting results.\nIn some circumstances, medication over the counter or on prescription can be used to help with insomnia.\nMedication can be effective in the short term but it can also&nbsp;cause insomnia to get worse, cause addiction, or other side effects."

        "disease": "Iron deficiency anaemia",
        "description": "Iron deficiency anaemia is a condition where a lack of iron in the body leads to a reduction in the number of red blood cells.\nIron is used to produce red blood cells, which&nbsp;help store and carry oxygen in the blood. If you have fewer red blood cells than is normal, your organs and tissues won&#8217;t get as much oxygen as they usually would.\nThere are several different types of anaemia, and each one has a different cause. Iron deficiency anaemia is the most common type.\nOther types of anaemia can be caused by a lack of vitamin B12 or folate in the body&nbsp;– read more about vitamin B12 and folate deficiency anaemia.\nMany people with iron deficiency anaemia only have a few symptoms. The severity of the symptoms largely depends on how quickly anaemia develops.\nYou may notice symptoms immediately, or they may develop gradually if your anaemia is caused by a long-term problem, such as a stomach ulcer.\nThe most common symptoms&nbsp;include:\n- tiredness and lack of energy (lethargy)\n- shortness of breath\n- noticeable heartbeats&nbsp;(heart palpitations)\n- a pale complexion\nLess common symptoms&nbsp;include:\n- headache&nbsp;\n- hearing sounds that come from inside the body, rather than from an outside source&nbsp;(tinnitus)\n- an altered sense of taste\n- feeling itchy\n- a sore or&nbsp;abnormally smooth tongue\n- hair loss\n- a desire to eat non-food items, such as ice, paper or clay (pica)\n- difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)\n- painful open sores (ulcers) on the corners of your mouth\n- spoon-shaped nails\nSee your GP if you experience symptoms of iron deficiency anaemia. They should be able to diagnose the condition using a simple&nbsp;blood test.\nRead more about diagnosing iron deficiency anaemia\nThere are many things that can lead to a lack of iron in the body. In men and post-menopausal women, the most common cause is bleeding in the stomach and intestines.\nThis can be caused by a stomach ulcer, stomach cancer, bowel cancer, or by taking&nbsp;non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\nIn women&nbsp;of reproductive age,&nbsp;heavy periods and pregnancy are the most common causes of iron deficiency anaemia as your body needs extra iron for your baby&nbsp;during pregnancy.\nUnless you&#8217;re pregnant, it&#8217;s rare for iron deficiency anaemia to be caused just by a lack of iron in your diet. However, if you do lack dietary iron, it may mean you&#8217;re more likely to develop anaemia than if you have one of the problems mentioned above.\nRead more about the causes of iron deficiency anaemia\nTreatment for iron deficiency anaemia involves taking iron supplements to&nbsp;boost the&nbsp;low levels of&nbsp;iron in your body. This is usually effective, and the condition rarely causes&nbsp;long-term problems.\nYou&#8217;ll need to be monitored every few months to check the treatment is working and your iron levels have returned to normal.\nThe underlying cause will need to be treated so you don&#8217;t get anaemia again. Increasing the amount of iron in your diet may also be recommended.\nGood sources of iron include:\n- dark-green leafy vegetables, such as watercress and curly kale\n- iron-fortified cereals or bread\n- brown rice&nbsp;\n- pulses and beans\n- nuts and seeds\n- meat, fish and&nbsp;tofu\n- eggs\n- dried fruit, such as dried apricots, prunes and raisins\nRead more about treating iron deficiency anaemia\nIf iron deficiency anaemia is left untreated, it can make you more susceptible to illness and infection, as a lack of iron affects&nbsp;the body&#8217;s natural defence system&nbsp;(the immune system).\nSevere iron deficiency anaemia may increase your risk of developing complications that affect the heart or lungs, such as an abnormally fast heartbeat (tachycardia) or&nbsp;heart failure, where your heart is unable to pump enough blood around your body at the right pressure.\nPregnant women with severe or untreated anaemia also have a higher risk of complications before and after birth.\nRead more about the complications of iron deficiency anaemia\nIron deficiency anaemia occurs when the body doesn&#8217;t have enough iron, leading to the decreased production of red blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body.\nA lack of iron can be caused by several factors. Some of the most common causes of iron deficiency anaemia are&nbsp;outlined below.\nIn women of reproductive age,&nbsp;periods are the&nbsp;most common cause of iron deficiency anaemia.\nUsually, only women with heavy periods develop iron deficiency anaemia. If you have heavy bleeding over several consecutive menstrual cycles, it&#8217;s known as menorrhagia.\nIt&#8217;s also very common for women to develop iron deficiency during pregnancy.\nThis is because your body needs extra iron&nbsp;to ensure your baby has a sufficient blood supply and receives necessary oxygen and nutrients.&nbsp;\nSome pregnant women require an iron supplement, while&nbsp;others may need to increase the amount of iron in their diet.\nRead more about vitamins and minerals in pregnancy\nThe gastrointestinal tract is the part of the body responsible for digesting food. It contains the stomach and intestines.\nBleeding in the gastrointestinal tract is the most common cause of iron deficiency anaemia in men, as well as women who&#8217;ve experienced the menopause (when monthly periods stop).\nMost people with gastrointestinal bleeding don&#8217;t notice any obvious blood in their stools and don&#8217;t experience any changes in their bowel habits.\nSome&nbsp;causes of gastrointestinal bleeding are described below.\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)&nbsp;can cause bleeding in the stomach. Ibuprofen and&nbsp;aspirin are two commonly prescribed NSAIDs.\nIf your GP thinks your medication is causing gastrointestinal bleeding, they can prescribe a less harmful medicine. However, don&#8217;t stop taking a medicine you&#8217;ve been prescribed unless your GP advises you to.\nThe acid in your stomach, which helps your body digest food, can sometimes eat into your stomach lining. When this happens, the acid forms an open sore (an ulcer). This is also known as a stomach ulcer or a peptic ulcer.\nStomach ulcers can cause the stomach lining to bleed, which can lead to anaemia. In some cases, the bleeding&nbsp;can cause you to&nbsp;vomit blood or pass blood in your stools. However, if the ulcer bleeds slowly, you may not&nbsp;have any symptoms.\nIn&nbsp;a few&nbsp;cases, gastrointestinal bleeding can be caused by cancer, usually stomach cancer or bowel cancer.\nWhen trying to establish the cause of anaemia, your GP will check for possible signs of cancer.\nIf your GP suspects cancer, you&#8217;ll be referred to a gastroenterologist (a specialist in treating digestive conditions) for a more thorough examination. This means that if cancer is found, it can be treated as quickly as possible.\nIf you&#8217;re 60 years old or over and have iron deficiency anaemia, your GP&nbsp;should refer you&nbsp;to a specialist to rule out bowel cancer. Your&nbsp; appointment with the specialist should be within two weeks of your GP referring you.\nGastrointestinal bleeding can also be caused by a condition called angiodysplasia. This is&nbsp;the result&nbsp;of&nbsp;abnormal, fragile superficial&nbsp;blood vessels in the gastrointestinal tract, which can cause bleeding.\nPeople with chronic kidney disease (CKD) often develop iron deficiency anaemia.\nMost people with CKD who have iron deficiency anaemia will be given iron supplement injections, although daily tablets&nbsp;may be&nbsp;tried first.\nYou can read more about&nbsp;treating anaemia in people with CKD&nbsp;on the National Institute&nbsp;for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) website.\nOther conditions or actions that cause blood loss and may lead to iron deficiency anaemia include:\n- inflammatory bowel disease&nbsp;–&nbsp;a condition that causes redness and swelling (inflammation) in the digestive system, such as Crohn&#8217;s disease and&nbsp;ulcerative colitis&nbsp;\n- oesophagitis –&nbsp;inflammation of the gullet (oesophagus)&nbsp;caused by stomach acid leaking through it\n- schistosomiasis&nbsp;– an infection caused by parasites, mainly found in sub-Saharan Africa\n- blood donation&nbsp;–&nbsp;donating a large amount of blood may lead to anaemia\n- trauma –&nbsp;a serious accident, such as a car crash, may cause you to lose a large amount of blood&nbsp;\n- nosebleeds&nbsp;–&nbsp;having regular nosebleeds may lead to anaemia, although&nbsp;this is rare\n- haematuria (blood in your urine) – but this rarely causes anaemia&nbsp;and may be a symptom of another condition\nMalabsorption is when your body can&#8217;t absorb iron from food, and is another possible cause of iron deficiency anaemia.\nThis may happen if you have coeliac disease, a common digestive condition where a person has an adverse reaction to gluten, or surgery to remove all or part of your stomach (gastrectomy).\nUnless you&#8217;re pregnant, it&#8217;s rare for iron deficiency anaemia to be caused solely by a lack of iron in your diet.\nHowever, a lack of dietary iron can increase your risk of developing anaemia if you also have any of the conditions mentioned above.\nSome studies suggest vegetarians or vegans are more at risk of iron deficiency anaemia because of the lack of meat in their diet.\nIf you are vegetarian or vegan,&nbsp;it is possible to gain enough iron by eating other types of food, such as:\n- beans\n- nuts\n- dried fruit, such as dried apricots\n- wholegrains, such as brown rice\n- fortified breakfast cereals\n- soybean flour\n- most dark-green leafy vegetables, such as watercress and curly kale\nIf you&#8217;re pregnant, you may need to increase the amount of iron-rich food you consume during pregnancy to help prevent iron deficiency anaemia.\nRead more about vegetarian and vegan diets\nSee your GP if you experience symptoms of iron deficiency anaemia, such as tiredness, shortness of breath and heart palpitations.\nA simple blood test can usually confirm the diagnosis.\nYour GP may also carry out a physical examination and ask you a number of questions to help determine the cause of your anaemia.\nTo diagnose iron deficiency anaemia, a blood sample&nbsp;is taken from a vein in your arm and a full blood count&nbsp;is made. This means&nbsp;all the different types of blood cells in the sample will be measured.\nIf you have anaemia:\n- your levels of haemoglobin&nbsp;– a substance that transports oxygen&nbsp;– will be lower than normal\n- you&#8217;ll have fewer red blood cells, which contain haemoglobin, than normal\n- your red blood cells may be smaller and paler than usual\nYour GP may also test for a substance called ferritin, a protein that stores iron. If your ferritin levels are low, it means there isn&#8217;t much iron stored in your body and you may&nbsp;have iron deficiency anaemia.\nRead more about blood tests&nbsp;\nIf your GP thinks your anaemia may be the result of a vitamin B12 and folate deficiency, the levels of these substances may be tested. Folate works with vitamin B12 to help your body produce red blood cells.\nVitamin B12 and folate deficiency&nbsp;anaemia&nbsp;is more common in people who are over the age of&nbsp;75.\nTo determine the underlying cause of your anaemia, your GP may ask questions about your lifestyle and medical history. For example, they may ask you about:\n- your diet –&nbsp;to see what you typically eat and whether this includes any iron-rich foods\n- any medicines you take –&nbsp;to see if you&#8217;ve been regularly taking a type of medicine that can cause bleeding from the stomach and intestines (gastrointestinal bleeding), such as&nbsp;ibuprofen or&nbsp;aspirin\n- your menstrual pattern –&nbsp;if you&#8217;re a woman, your GP may ask if you&#8217;ve been experiencing particularly heavy periods\n- your family history –&nbsp;you&#8217;ll be asked if your immediate family has anaemia or&nbsp;a history of gastrointestinal bleeding or blood disorders\nIron&nbsp;deficiency anaemia is common during pregnancy. If you&#8217;re pregnant, your GP will usually only look for an alternative cause if a blood test has identified a particularly low haemoglobin level, or if your symptoms or medical history suggest your anaemia may be caused by something else.\nA&nbsp;physical examination will usually only be needed if the cause of your iron anaemia deficiency hasn&#8217;t been identified by examining your medical history and asking you about your symptoms.\nIn such cases, your GP may:\n- examine your stomach (abdomen) to check for any physical signs of gastrointestinal bleeding\n- look for signs of&nbsp;heart failure, such as&nbsp;swollen ankles&nbsp;–&nbsp;heart failure can have some similar symptoms to iron deficiency anaemia\nTwo other possible types of physical examination you may have are explained below.\nA&nbsp;rectal examination is usually only needed if you&#8217;re bleeding from your bottom. It&#8217;s&nbsp;a common procedure that can help your GP find out if there&#8217;s something in your gastrointestinal tract that&#8217;s causing bleeding.\nYour GP will insert a lubricated&nbsp;gloved&nbsp;finger into your bottom to feel for any abnormalities.\nA rectal examination isn&#8217;t something to be embarrassed about, as it&#8217;s a procedure your GP will be used to doing. It shouldn&#8217;t cause significant pain, but it may cause some slight discomfort&nbsp;– this will only last for a minute.\nWomen may have a pelvic examination if their GP thinks heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) may be the cause of their anaemia.\nDuring a pelvic examination, your GP will examine your vulva and labia (external sex organs) for signs of bleeding or infection.\nThey may also examine you internally. This will involve your GP inserting lubricated gloved fingers into your vagina to feel whether your&nbsp;womb (uterus)&nbsp;is tender or enlarged.\nA pelvic examination won&#8217;t be carried out without your consent&nbsp;(permission), and you can choose to have someone with you.\nIn some cases, your GP may refer you to a gastroenterologist, a specialist in treating digestive conditions. They&#8217;ll carry out a more thorough examination.\nFor example, you may be referred to a gastroenterologist if your GP can&#8217;t identify a cause and you have a particularly low haemoglobin level, or if your GP thinks there&#8217;s a possibility your symptoms could be caused by stomach cancer or&nbsp;bowel cancer, although this is unlikely.\nIf you&#8217;re a woman with heavy periods, you may be referred to a gynaecologist if you don&#8217;t respond to treatment with iron supplements.\nTreatment for iron deficiency anaemia usually involves taking iron supplements and changing your diet to increase your iron levels, as well as treating the underlying cause.\nYour GP will prescribe an iron supplement to restore the iron missing from your body. The most commonly prescribed supplement is ferrous sulphate,&nbsp;which is taken&nbsp;as a tablet, usually twice a day.\nSome people can&nbsp;experience side effects when taking iron supplements, including:\n- abdominal (tummy) pain\n- constipation&nbsp;or diarrhoea\n- heartburn\n- feeling sick\n- black stools (faeces)\nThese side effects should settle down over time. However, your GP may recommend taking the tablets with food or shortly after eating if you have troublesome side effects.\nYour GP may also advise you to only take one or two tablets a day, instead of three, if you&#8217;re finding side effects difficult to cope with.\nIf you can&#8217;t take ferrous sulphate because you get severe side effects, you may be prescribed a different iron supplement called ferrous gluconate.\nThis supplement should cause fewer side effects because it contains a less concentrated dose of iron. However, it may take longer for the iron levels in your body to be restored.\nIn&nbsp;a few&nbsp;cases&nbsp;–&nbsp;for example, if you have chronic kidney disease (CKD)&nbsp;– iron injections may be recommended instead of tablets.\nAs with all medications,&nbsp;it&#8217;s important to store iron supplements out of the reach of children. An overdose of iron supplements in a young child can be fatal.\nIf a lack of iron in your diet is thought to be contributing to your iron deficiency anaemia, your GP will tell you how to up your intake.\nIron-rich foods include:\n- dark-green leafy vegetables, such as&nbsp;watercress and curly kale\n- iron-fortified cereals or bread\n- brown rice&nbsp;\n- pulses and beans&nbsp;\n- nuts and seeds\n- white and red meat&nbsp;\n- fish&nbsp;\n- tofu\n- eggs&nbsp;\n- dried fruit,&nbsp;such as&nbsp;dried apricots, prunes and raisins\nYour diet should include foods from all the major food groups to ensure it&#8217;s&nbsp;healthy and balanced. In particular,&nbsp;food and drink containing vitamin C&nbsp;are important&nbsp;as vitamin C helps your body absorb iron.\nHowever, consuming large amounts of some foods and drinks, as well as certain&nbsp;medicines,&nbsp;may make it harder for your body to absorb iron. These include:\n- tea and coffee\n- calcium&nbsp;–&nbsp;found in&nbsp;dairy products, such as milk&nbsp;\n- antacids&nbsp;and&nbsp;proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)&nbsp;–&nbsp;medications used&nbsp;to relieve indigestion\n- wholegrain cereals&nbsp;–&nbsp;although wholegrains are a good source of iron themselves, they contain phytic acid, which can stop your body absorbing iron from other foods and pills\nYou may be referred to a nutrition specialist called a dietitian if you&#8217;re finding it difficult to include iron in your diet. They&#8217;ll be able to give you detailed, personalised advice about how you can&nbsp;improve your diet.\nYour GP will also need to ensure&nbsp;the underlying cause of your anaemia is treated so&nbsp;it doesn&#8217;t happen again.\nFor example, if&nbsp;non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are causing bleeding in your stomach, your GP may prescribe a different medicine to help minimise the risk of stomach bleeding.\nHeavy periods can&nbsp;be treated with&nbsp;medication or –&nbsp;in particularly severe cases –&nbsp;surgery.\nYour GP will ask you to return two to four weeks after you&#8217;ve started taking&nbsp;iron supplements to check how well you&#8217;ve responded to the treatment. You&#8217;ll have a&nbsp;blood test&nbsp;to check your haemoglobin levels.\nIf your&nbsp;blood test results show an improvement, you&#8217;ll be asked to continue taking iron supplements and return in two to four&nbsp;months for another blood test.\nOnce your haemoglobin levels and red blood cells are normal, your GP will usually recommend continuing to&nbsp;take iron supplements for three months to help build up the iron levels in your body.\nAfter this, you should be able to stop taking the supplements, depending on the cause of your iron deficiency anaemia. Your condition will be monitored every three months over the course of a year, and again a year later.\nSometimes after a person&#8217;s iron levels have been replenished, they start to fall again.\nThis could happen if you don&#8217;t get enough iron in your diet, you&#8217;re pregnant, or you have consistently heavy periods.\nIn such cases, you may be prescribed an ongoing iron supplement to help stop your anaemia returning. This will usually be a tablet, which you&#8217;ll have to take once a day.&nbsp;\nIf your iron levels don&#8217;t improve, your GP will ask how regularly you&#8217;ve been taking your iron supplements.\nSome people are put off taking the medication because of the side effects. However, your condition won&#8217;t improve if you don&#8217;t take the supplements.\nIf you&#8217;ve been taking the supplements as prescribed and your iron levels still haven&#8217;t improved, your GP may refer you to a specialist for an assessment.\nIron deficiency anaemia rarely causes serious or long-term complications, although some people with the condition find it affects their daily life.\nSome&nbsp;common complications are outlined below.\nIron deficiency anaemia can make you feel tired and lacking in energy (lethargic). This may result in you being less productive at work, and&nbsp;you may find it difficult to stay awake&nbsp;or&nbsp;not feel able to exercise regularly.\nResearch has shown&nbsp;iron deficiency anaemia can affect your immune system&nbsp;– the body&#8217;s natural defence system. This increases your vulnerability to infection.\nAdults with severe anaemia may be at risk of developing complications that affect their heart or lungs.\nFor example, you may develop tachycardia, which is&nbsp;an abnormally fast heartbeat,&nbsp;or&nbsp;heart failure, where the heart fails to pump enough blood around your body at the right pressure.\nPregnant women with severe anaemia have an increased risk of developing complications, particularly during and after birth.\nThey may also develop&nbsp;postnatal depression, which some women experience after having a baby.\nResearch suggests babies born to mothers who have untreated anaemia are more likely to:\n- be born prematurely&nbsp;–&nbsp;before the 37th week of pregnancy\n- have a low birth weight\n- have problems with&nbsp;iron levels themselves\n- do less well in mental ability tests\nSome cases of&nbsp;restless legs syndrome are thought to be caused by iron deficiency anaemia. Doctors often refer to this as secondary restless legs syndrome.\nRestless legs syndrome&nbsp;is a common condition that affects the nervous system, and&nbsp;causes an overwhelming, irresistible urge to move the legs. It also causes an unpleasant feeling in the feet, calves and thighs.\nRestless legs syndrome caused by iron deficiency anaemia&nbsp;can usually be treated with iron supplements."

With the right strategies, IBS can be successfully managed.\nIBS does not pose a serious threat to your physical health and does not increase your chances of developing cancer or other bowel-related conditions.\nThe exact cause of IBS is unknown. Many causes have been suggested but none have been proven to lead to IBS.\nThe symptoms of IBS vary between individuals and affect some people more severely than others. Symptoms can become worse, often during times of stress or after eating certain foods.\nYou may find some of the symptoms of IBS ease after going to the toilet and moving your bowels.\nThe most common symptoms of IBS are:\n- abdominal (stomach) pain&nbsp;and cramping, which may be relieved by moving your bowels\n- a change in your bowel habits – such as&nbsp;diarrhoea,&nbsp;constipation&nbsp;or sometimes both\n- bloating and swelling of your stomach\n- excessive wind (flatulence)\n- occasionally experiencing an urgent need to move your bowels\nOther less common symptoms may also be experienced, such as:\n- lack of energy (lethargy)\n- feeling sick\n- heartburn\nThe symptoms of IBS can also have a significant impact on a person&#8217;s day-to-day life and, as a result, some people may experience symptoms of low mood and stress.\nYou have other symptoms, including:\nThese can sometimes be a sign of a potentially more serious condition.\nYou should also tell your GP if you have these symptoms and a family history of&nbsp;bowel cancer&nbsp;or&nbsp;ovarian cancer.\nThere are no specific tests for IBS. Many cases can be diagnosed based on your symptom history and your GP will undertake some routine blood and stool tests to rule out other conditions.\nAs the symptoms of IBS are similar to other conditions such as&nbsp;coeliac disease&nbsp;and inflammatory bowel disease, it is important to rule these out.\nIt is important not to make any dietary changes until these tests have been done. This is particularly important for the&nbsp;blood test for coeliac disease&nbsp;as the result can be affected by your diet.\nPrivate allergy testing (for example hair sampling) is not a reliable way to test for allergies or intolerances.

        "disease": "Joint hypermobility",
        "description": "Joint hypermobility means that some or all of a person’s joints have an unusually large range of movement.\nPeople with hypermobility are very supple. This means they&#8217;re able to move their limbs into positions others find impossible.\nSome people also refer to this as having loose joints or being double-jointed.\nMany people with hypermobile joints don’t have any problems. For some people the extra flexibility may be a benefit. For example ballet dancers or gymnasts.\nBut, some people with joint hypermobility can have symptoms like:\n- pain and stiffness in the joints and muscles\n- clicking joints\n- joints that dislocate (come out of the correct position) easily\n- fatigue (extreme tiredness)\n- recurrent injuries – like sprains\n- digestive problems – like constipation and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\n- dizziness and fainting\n- thin or stretchy skin\nIf you have these symptoms with hypermobility, this could be a sign of:\n- hypermobile Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (hEDS)\n- Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder (HSD)\nA person with hEDS or HSD may also have some other symptoms related to stretchiness in the connective tissues throughout their body. The severity can differ from one person to another.\nhEDS or HSD can cause symptoms that affect your digestive system. This is because the connective tissue within your digestive system is more stretchy. This makes squeezing food either more difficult or quicker causing a range of problems including:\n- gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)\n- gastroparesis – where the stomach has difficulty emptying its contents into the small bowel which can cause bloating and nausea\n- constipation\n- irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\nhEDS or HSD can also cause abnormalities in the part of your nervous system that controls bodily functions you do not actively think about. These are things like your heart beating. This is known as your autonomic nervous system.\nThese abnormalities can cause problems when you stand up or sit in the same position for a while. Your blood pressure can drop to low levels, making you feel sick, dizzy and sweaty. You may also faint.\nIn some people, these abnormalities can lead to postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). POTS causes your pulse rate to increase rapidly within a few minutes of standing up. You may also experience:\n- dizziness or fainting\n- headaches\n- tummy upsets\n- sweating\n- a sensation of anxiety\n- purple puffy fingers and feet\n- a pounding or fluttering heart beat (heart palpitations)\nPeople with hEDS or HSD may have other related conditions and further symptoms, including:\n- stress incontinence – when urine leaks out when your bladder is under pressure\n- hernias – where an internal part of the body, like an organ, pushes through a weakness in the muscle or surrounding tissue wall\n- in women, pelvic organ prolapse – where the organs inside the pelvis slip down from their normal position\n- varicose veins – swollen and enlarged veins, usually blue or dark purple\n- flat feet – where the inner part of your feet (the arch) is not raised off the ground when you stand\n- headaches\n- drooping eyelids\n- a tendency to bruise easily and develop stretch marks\n- thin or stretchy skin\n- \nYour healthcare professional may use the Beighton score if they think you have joint hypermobility. This score can be used as a quick test to assess the range of movement in some of your joints.\nBut, this cannot be used to confirm a diagnosis, because it&#8217;s important to look at all the joints and take into account a persons symptoms. The Beighton score does not include all the joints for example shoulders and hips.\nYour healthcare professional may also carry out blood tests and X-rays to rule out other conditions linked with joint pains like rheumatoid arthritis.\nThe Beighton score consists of a series of 5 tests, the results of which can add up to a total of 9 points.\nThe score is worked out as follows:\n- 1 point if you can place your palms on the ground while standing with your legs straight\n- 1 point for each elbow that bends backwards\n- 1 point for each knee that bends backwards\n- 1 point for each thumb that touches the forearm when bent backwards\n- 1 point for each little finger that bends backwards beyond 90 degrees\nIf your Beighton score is 4 or more, it&#8217;s likely that you have joint hypermobility.\nA person with hEDS or HSD may also have a number of other symptoms related to weaknesses in the connective tissues throughout their body.\nJoint hypermobility is often hereditary (runs in families). One of the main causes is thought to be linked to changes in a type of protein called collagen.\nCollagen is found throughout the body. For example, its found in:\n- skin\n- ligaments (the tough bands of connective tissue that link 2 bones together at a joint)\nIf collagen is more stretchy and lax than it should be then the ligaments, tendons and muscles around the joints allow a greater range of movement. This means they also sometimes cannot keep the joints stable.\nThere is no genetic test currently available for hEDS or HSD. It&#8217;s likely that more than one gene is involved. There are genetic tests for rarer forms of EDS.\nMore information is available on the Ehlers-Danlos Support UK website.\nYou won&#8217;t need treatment of your joint hypermobility if doesn&#8217;t cause any problems.\nBut, you may need treatment and support if you have hEDS or HSD. These can cause a wide range of symptoms, including joint pain and digestive problems.\nIf you&#8217;re experiencing symptoms, there are some things you can do yourself that can help. These include:\n- eating a healthy diet and maintaining a healthy weight which can help improve your joint strength, reducing the strain on them\n- trying to have good sleep routine (sleep hygiene)\n- staying as active as you can, but sticking to low-impact exercises, like swimming, cycling, pilates or tai chi to reduce strain on your joints.\n- wearing comfortable and supportive footwear to support your ankles\n- using heat or ice can be a helpful pain treatment\nOur information on soft tissue injury can help your recovery if you have an injury to your soft tissues such as your muscles, tendons, joint or ligaments\nIf doing exercises that have a specific focus on increasing flexibility such as yoga, be careful not to over stretch hypermobile areas.\nIf you&#8217;re struggling with any of your symptoms you should contact your healthcare professional.\nThere are also support groups you can contact that will offer support for people with hEDS or HSD:\n- Hypermobility Syndromes Association\n- Ehlers-Danlos Support UK\nPhysiotherapy can help people with hypermobile joints in many ways. For example, it may help to:\n- reduce pain\n- improve muscle strength and fitness\n- improve posture\n- improve your sense of your body’s position and movement (proprioception)\n- correct the movement of individual joints\nIt’s helpful to have a physiotherapist with knowledge of hEDS or HSD, as some physiotherapy treatments can make symptoms worse.\nA wide range of physiotherapy techniques can be used. You may be advised to follow an exercise programme that includes:\n- strength and balance training\n- special stretching techniques\n- advice about pacing\nPacing involves balancing periods of activity with periods of rest. It means not overdoing it or pushing yourself beyond your limits. If you do push yourself too hard, you could slow your long-term progress.\nOccupational therapy aims to help you overcome difficulties in your everyday life caused by having hEDS or HSD.\nThis may involve teaching you alternative ways of carrying out a certain task. For example, an occupational therapist can give you advice about:\n- reducing the strain on your joints while using a computer\n- getting dressed\n- suggest ways to adapt your home to make moving around easier like if using stairs is a problem\nYou may also be able to get equipment to make some tasks easier. For example, special grips can make holding a pen easier and help improve handwriting.\nFlat feet can be a problem for some people with hEDS or HSD. Flat feet is where someone has no arch in the inner part of their feet. This can put a strain on nearby muscles and ligaments (tissue that connects bones together at a joint).\nIf you have problems with your feet, a podiatrist (a foot specialist) can recommend footwear for both indoors and outdoors. These will support the foot arches and can help with foot, knee, hip and back pain. They can recommend footwear and insoles if necessary.\nMedication can be used to manage the pain associated with hEDS or HSD.\nPainkillers available over the counter from pharmacies, like paracetamol, can sometimes help. Your GP can also prescribe a medicine that contains both paracetamol and codeine, which is a stronger type of painkiller. Liquid paracetamol (like Calpol) may be helpful for children with hEDS or HSD.\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen may help in some cases.\nPainkillers and NSAIDs are also available as gels or sprays that can be applied directly onto painful joints.\nAlways check the patient information leaflet that comes with over-the-counter medication. This is so you&#8217;re sure its suitable for you before you take it.\nSome people with hEDS or HSD may find pain medication is not effective for them.\nSome people with hEDS or HSD have said that local anaesthetic has not had any effect on them. If you are having a procedure that requires local anaesthetic, you may want to discuss this with your doctor or dentist beforehand.\nIf painkillers are not helping to reduce your pain, you may benefit from being referred to a pain specialist at a pain clinic. Staff at the clinic will be able to provide further advice and treatment.\nFor example, some people with hEDS or HSD benefit from cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). CBT is a pain management programme that may help when painkillers are not working.\nPain specialists may also give you stronger medication used to treat nerve (neuropathic) pain. These drugs should only be continued if there are clear benefits.\nThis type of pain is often called chronic pain."

        "disease": "Kaposi’s sarcoma",
        "description": "Kaposi’s sarcoma is a rare type of cancer caused by a virus. It can affect the skin and internal organs.\nIt’s mainly seen in people with a poorly controlled or severe&nbsp;HIV&nbsp;infection. It can&nbsp;also affect some people who have a weakened immune system for another reason, as well as people who have&nbsp;a genetic vulnerability to the virus.\nThe most common initial symptom is the appearance of small, painless, flat and discoloured patches on the skin or inside the mouth. They’re usually red or purple and look similar to bruises.\nOver time, the patches may grow into lumps known as nodules and may merge into each other.\nInternal organs can also be affected, including the&nbsp;lymph nodes, lungs and the digestive system, which&nbsp;can cause symptoms such as:\n- uncomfortable swelling in the arms or legs&nbsp;(lymphoedema)\n- breathlessness, coughing up blood&nbsp;and&nbsp;chest pain\n- nausea, vomiting,&nbsp;stomach pain&nbsp;and&nbsp;diarrhoea\nThe rate at which symptoms progress depends on the type of Kaposi’s sarcoma you have.&nbsp;Most types get worse quickly in a matter of weeks or months without treatment, but some progress very slowly over many years.\nYou should speak to your GP if you have any worrying symptoms you think could be caused by Kaposi’s sarcoma.&nbsp;If you have HIV, you can also contact your local HIV clinic&nbsp;if you have any concerns.\nYour doctor will ask about your symptoms and examine your skin to look for the characteristic discoloured patches. If they suspect Kaposi’s sarcoma, they will refer you for further tests to confirm the diagnosis.\nThese tests may include:\n- an HIV test – a blood test to confirm whether or not you have HIV (if you haven’t already been diagnosed with the condition)\n- a skin&nbsp;biopsy&nbsp;– where a small sample of cells is removed from an affected area of skin and&nbsp;checked for Kaposi’s sarcoma cells\n- an&nbsp;endoscopy&nbsp;–&nbsp;where a thin, flexible tube called an endoscope is passed down your throat to see if your lungs or digestive system are affected\n- a&nbsp;computerised tomography (CT)&nbsp;scan&nbsp;to see if&nbsp;your lymph nodes or other parts of your body are affected\nKaposi’s sarcoma is caused by a virus called the human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), also known as the Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). This virus is thought to be&nbsp;spread during sex, through saliva, or from a mother to her baby during birth.\nHHV-8 is a relatively common virus and the vast majority of people who have it will not develop Kaposi’s sarcoma.&nbsp;It only seems to cause cancer in some people with a weakened immune system and in some people who have&nbsp;a genetic vulnerability to the virus.\nA weakened immune system allows the HHV-8 virus to multiply to high levels in the blood, which increases the chance it will cause Kaposi’s sarcoma.\nThe&nbsp;virus&nbsp;appears to alter the genetic instructions that control cell growth. This means some cells reproduce uncontrollably and form lumps of tissue known as tumours.\nThere are 4 main types of Kaposi’s sarcoma. These types affect different groups of people and are treated in different ways.\nAlthough it’s not as common as it used to be, Kaposi’s sarcoma is still one of the main types of cancer to affect people with HIV.&nbsp;\nHIV-related Kaposi’s sarcoma can progress very quickly if not treated. However, it can usually be controlled by taking HIV medication – known as combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) – to prevent HIV multiplying and allow the immune system to recover. The immune system can then reduce the levels of HHV-8 in the body.\nRead more about&nbsp;treating HIV.\nSome people may also require treatment with&nbsp;radiotherapy&nbsp;(where high-energy rays are used&nbsp;to destroy cancer cells) or&nbsp;chemotherapy&nbsp;(where powerful medications are used to destroy cancer cells), depending on the site and extent of the cancer and what symptoms it’s causing.\nClassic Kaposi’s sarcoma mainly affects middle-aged and elderly men of Mediterranean or Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Ashkenazi Jews are descended from Jewish communities that lived in central and eastern Europe. Most Jewish people in&nbsp;the UK&nbsp;are Ashkenazi Jews.\nIt’s thought people who develop classic Kaposi’s sarcoma were born with a genetic vulnerability to the HHV-8 virus.\nUnlike the other types of Kaposi’s sarcoma,&nbsp;the symptoms of classic Kaposi’s sarcoma progress very slowly over many years and are usually&nbsp;limited to the skin.\nImmediate treatment isn’t usually required because, in many cases, the condition doesn’t affect&nbsp;life expectancy. You’ll usually be monitored carefully and only treated if the symptoms get significantly worse.\nRadiotherapy is&nbsp;often used if treatment is required, although small&nbsp;skin patches or nodules may be removed using minor surgery or cryotherapy (freezing).\nTransplant-related Kaposi’s sarcoma is a rare complication of an organ transplant.&nbsp;It occurs because the immunosuppressant medication used to weaken the immune system and help prevent the body rejecting the new organ can allow a previous HHV-8 infection to reactivate, which means levels of the virus increase as it starts multiplying again.\nTransplant-related Kaposi’s sarcoma can be aggressive and usually needs to be treated quickly. It’s&nbsp;normally treated by reducing or stopping the immunosuppressants, if this is possible. If this is unsuccessful, radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be used.\nEndemic African Kaposi’s sarcoma is common in parts of Africa and is one of the most widespread types of cancer in that region.\nAlthough this type of Kaposi’s sarcoma is classified separately from HIV-related Kaposi’s sarcoma, many cases may actually result from an undiagnosed HIV infection. All suspected cases therefore&nbsp;must have an HIV test, as the most effective treatment in these cases is HIV medication.\nIn cases not caused by HIV infection, this type of Kaposi’s sarcoma may be the result of a genetic vulnerability to HHV-8. These cases are usually treated with chemotherapy, although sometimes radiotherapy may be used.\nWith proper treatment, Kaposi’s sarcoma can usually be controlled for many years. Deaths from the condition are uncommon in the UK.\nThe discoloured patches of skin will often shrink and fade with treatment, although they may not ever disappear completely.\nA complete cure for any type of Kaposi’s sarcoma isn’t always possible, and there’s a chance the condition could recur in the future. If you think this is happening, contact your HIV clinic, hospital specialist or GP as soon as possible."

        "disease": "Kidney cancer",
        "description": "Kidney cancer is the eighth most common cancer in adults in the UK.\nSigns and symptoms of kidney cancer can include:\n- blood in your urine&nbsp;\n- a constant pain in your side, just below the ribs\n- a lump or swelling in the kidney area (on either side of the body)\nSpeak to your GP as soon as possible if you experience any of these symptoms. They will examine you and may refer you to a specialist clinic for further tests.\nIn around half of all cases of kidney cancer, there are no symptoms, and the condition is detected during tests for other unrelated conditions.\nRead more about the&nbsp;symptoms of kidney cancer&nbsp;and&nbsp;diagnosing kidney cancer.\nThe kidneys are 2 bean-shaped organs located on either side of the body, just underneath the ribcage.\nTheir main role is to filter out waste products from the blood, in addition to producing urine. Only 1 of the kidneys is usually affected by cancer.\nThe human body is made up of billions of cells, which normally grow and multiply in an orderly way, with new cells being created only when and where they&#8217;re needed. In cancer, this orderly process goes wrong and cells begin to grow and multiply uncontrollably.\nExactly what triggers this growth&nbsp;is unknown. However, there are certain risk factors that can increase the chances of the condition developing, such as&nbsp;smoking&nbsp;and&nbsp;obesity.\nKidney cancer most frequently affects people over 50 years of age and is more common among men.\nRead more about the&nbsp;causes of kidney cancer.\nMany different types of cancer can affect the kidneys. The most common type is renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which accounts for&nbsp;more than 80%&nbsp;of all kidney cancers.\nRarer types of kidney cancer include:\n- transitional cell cancer – develops in the lining of the kidneys and usually affects men who are 50 years of age or over\n- Wilms’ tumour – a rare type of kidney cancer that affects children\nThis topic focuses on RCC. Read the Cancer Research UK website for more information about transitional cell cancer and Wilms’ tumour.\nThe earlier kidney cancer is diagnosed, the easier it is to treat.\nHow it&#8217;s treated will depend on the size and spread of the cancer. Surgery to remove the cancerous cells is usually the first course of action.\nUnlike most other cancers,&nbsp;chemotherapy&nbsp;isn&#8217;t very effective at treating kidney cancer. However, non-surgical treatments are available, such as&nbsp;radiotherapy&nbsp;or targeted therapies. These are most commonly used in the more advanced stages of kidney cancer, when the cancer has spread beyond the kidney.\nRead more about&nbsp;treating kidney cancer.\nAs the causes of kidney cancer aren&#8217;t fully understood, it&#8217;s not possible to fully prevent it.\nHowever, leading a healthy lifestyle may reduce the chances of developing the condition. A combination of a&nbsp;healthy diet&nbsp;and&nbsp;regular exercise&nbsp;will help to avoid becoming overweight or obese, which is a significant risk factor for kidney cancer.\nIf you&#8217;re overweight or obese, you can lose weight and maintain a healthy weight by combining regular exercise with a calorie-controlled diet.\nRead more about&nbsp;treating obesity.\nMost cases of kidney cancer don&#8217;t cause any symptoms in the early stages.\nThe most common symptoms of mid- to advanced-stage kidney cancer are:\n- blood in your urine (haematuria) – the amount of blood is usually high enough to change the colour of your urine to a reddish or dark brown colour\n- a&nbsp;persistent&nbsp;pain in your side, just below the ribs\n- a lump or swelling in the area of your&nbsp;kidneys (on either side of the body)\nHowever, in around half of all cases, the cancer causes no symptoms and is only detected during a routine&nbsp;ultrasound scan.\nLess common symptoms of kidney cancer include:\n- extreme tiredness (fatigue) or&nbsp;anaemia\n- unintentional weight loss\n- a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above\n- night sweats&nbsp;\n- a general sense of feeling unwell\n- swelling of the veins in the testicles (in men)\n- loss of appetite\n- high blood pressure (hypertension)\nSpeak to your GP immediately if you have pain or a swelling or lump in your kidney area (on either side of your body, just below your ribcage).\nYou should also speak to your GP if you&nbsp;have blood in your urine. Although it&#8217;s highly unlikely to be caused by kidney cancer, it could&nbsp;be&nbsp;a symptom of a less serious condition that still requires treatment, such as a&nbsp;kidney stone&nbsp;or bladder stone.\nThe exact cause of kidney cancer is unknown, but there are risk factors that can increase the chances of developing the condition.\nThe&nbsp;3&nbsp;main risk factors for kidney cancer are:\n- obesity\n- smoking\n- family history and genetics\nObesity is&nbsp;a significant risk factor for kidney cancer.\nThere&#8217;s a strong link between someone’s&nbsp;body mass index (BMI) and their risk of developing kidney cancer. Read more about&nbsp;how BMI is calculated,&nbsp;and work out your BMI.&nbsp;\nA BMI score of 25 or above has been shown to increase a person&#8217;s chances of developing kidney cancer. Those with a BMI score of 30 or above are at particularly high risk.\nThis may be because overweight or obese people, particularly women, have higher levels of a hormone called oestrogen in their body. It&#8217;s thought that excess levels of oestrogen may stimulate the growth of cancerous cells.\nCases of kidney cancer have been increasing over the last 40 years, which has been linked to rising obesity levels.\nSmoking is also a&nbsp;significant risk factor for developing kidney cancer, and the more you smoke the greater the risk.\nFor example, research has shown that if you regularly smoke 10 cigarettes a day, you&#8217;re one-and-a-half times&nbsp;more likely to develop kidney cancer compared to a non-smoker. This increases to twice as likely&nbsp;if you smoke 20 or more cigarettes a day.\nIt&#8217;s not clear why smoking increases your chances of developing kidney cancer.\nIf you have a close family member (parents, brothers, sisters or a child) who&#8217;s been diagnosed with kidney cancer, you&#8217;re about twice as likely to develop kidney cancer yourself.\nExamples of inherited genetic conditions and syndromes that increase your risk of developing kidney cancer include:\n- tuberous sclerosis – a rare genetic condition that causes multiple non-cancerous (benign) tumours to grow in the body; it’s autosomal dominant, which means you only have to inherit the faulty gene from one parent to get it; about 1 in every 100 people with tuberous sclerosis will develop kidney cancer\n- hereditary papillary kidney cancer – a rare form of cancer caused by faulty genes inherited from your parents; it’s autosomal dominant and causes small, slow-growing, cancerous tumours to develop in the kidneys, which can sometimes spread\n- hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) – a rare, autosomal dominant form of cancer, where cancerous tumours develop from smooth muscle tissue (leiomyomatas); people with HLRCC have a 10&nbsp;to 16% increased risk of developing kidney cancer\n- Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome – a rare genetic syndrome that causes small non-cancerous tumours to develop inside the nervous system; VHL is also autosomal dominant and about 4 out of 10 people who have it develop kidney cancer\n- Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome – an inherited syndrome that causes non-cancerous tumours to develop in the hair follicles of the skin; they usually occur on the face, neck and torso\nThere are also a&nbsp;number of other possible risk factors for developing kidney cancer, including:\n- mild painkillers – some mild painkillers have been linked to an increased risk of developing kidney cancer;&nbsp;NSAIDs, such as&nbsp;ibuprofen, may slightly increase the risk, although occasional use or low doses are unlikely to be harmful\n- kidney disease&nbsp;– if you have kidney failure and need to have regular&nbsp;dialysis&nbsp;(treatment to replicate the functions of the kidneys), your risk of developing kidney cysts and kidney cancer is increased\n- high blood pressure (hypertension)&nbsp;– high blood pressure is a known risk factor for kidney disease, and you&#8217;re up to twice as likely to develop kidney cancer if you have raised blood pressure\nIn many cases, kidney cancer is diagnosed after routine scans and check-ups, as the condition doesn&#8217;t always have obvious symptoms.\nYou should speak to your GP if you have any symptoms of kidney cancer,&nbsp;such as&nbsp;blood in your urine or a constant pain below your ribs.\nYour GP will examine you and, if they think your symptoms need further assessment, refer you to a specialist urologist (a doctor who&nbsp;specialises in&nbsp;conditions that affect the urinary tract).\nIf you notice blood in your urine,&nbsp;your GP will usually&nbsp;carry out a&nbsp;blood test&nbsp;and take a urine sample. The results will help rule out other&nbsp;possible causes, such as infection or&nbsp;kidney stones.\nIn 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of&nbsp;renal (kidney) cancer&nbsp;and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected&nbsp;kidney cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on&nbsp;Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral.\nIf you need to be referred urgently, you&#8217;ll usually be seen within 2 weeks.\nIf your GP refers you to a hospital specialist,&nbsp;further tests will help&nbsp;determine whether you have kidney cancer.\nAn&nbsp;ultrasound scan&nbsp;uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of an organ in the body. It can often detect changes in the shape of the kidney that might be&nbsp;caused by&nbsp;a cancerous tumour.\nAn ultrasound scan may be needed if the cause of the blood in your urine can&#8217;t be found.\nYou may also be referred for a&nbsp;computerised tomography (CT) scan. During a CT scan, a series of detailed images of the inside of your body are taken and put together by a computer.\nIf you have a CT scan, you may be given a special dye to drink, or it may be injected. The dye makes the results of the CT scan clearer.\nIn some cases of kidney cancer, an image-guided&nbsp;biopsy&nbsp;is carried out. It&#8217;s a minor surgical procedure performed under&nbsp;local anaesthetic.&nbsp;This means you&#8217;ll be awake during the procedure, but the&nbsp;area surrounding the affected kidney will be numbed, so that you don&#8217;t feel anything.\nDuring an image-guided biopsy, a radiologist or surgeon will use an ultrasound or CT scan to guide a needle through your skin and into your kidney. A small tissue sample will be removed from your kidney and examined under a microscope to check for cancerous cells.\nYou may also need to have a&nbsp;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, which can be used to&nbsp;produce detailed images of your kidneys. The images can help identify a tumour and determine&nbsp;its size.\nA&nbsp;cystoscopy is a medical procedure that uses an instrument called a cystoscope to examine the&nbsp;inside of your bladder and urinary system.\nThis procedure&nbsp;doesn&#8217;t look at&nbsp;the kidneys, but it can rule out or confirm whether any bleeding is coming from problems in the bladder.\nAn intravenous pyelogram (IVP) test involves injecting a dye into your bloodstream.&nbsp;X-rays&nbsp;are taken after a short time, with the dye highlighting any growths present in the kidneys.\nIf kidney cancer is confirmed, it&#8217;s usually possible to determine its grade and stage.\nThe stage describes how far the cancer has spread, and the grade describes how aggressive the cancer is and how quickly it&#8217;s likely to spread.\nBoth the stage and grade of your kidney cancer will help determine your recommended treatment and the likelihood of achieving a cure.\nHealthcare professionals use the TNM system&nbsp;to stage kidney cancer:\n- T – indicates how large the tumour has grown (a tumour is a lump of cancerous tissue)\n- N – indicates whether nearby lymph nodes are affected (lymph nodes are small, oval-shaped glands found throughout the body, which help protect against infection)\n- M – indicates whether the cancer has spread to another part of the body (M stands for metastases, which is the medical term for cancer that has spread)\nThe stages of tumour size are:\n- T1a – where the tumour is less than 4cm (about 1.6 inches)&nbsp;in diameter\n- T1b – where the tumour is 4&nbsp;to 7cm (about 1.6-2.8 inches) in diameter\n- T2 – where the tumour is larger than 7cm (2.8 inches)&nbsp;in diameter, but hasn&#8217;t spread out of the kidney\n- T3a – where the tumour has spread into the adrenal gland or the layer of fat surrounding the kidney\n- T3b – where the tumour has spread into the renal vein (the vein that carries blood back from the kidney to the heart) or into the vena cava (the vein that carries blood back from the top half of the body)\n- T3c – where the tumour has spread past the diaphragm (the sheet of muscle that separates the top part of the abdomen from the bottom part)\n- T4 – where the tumour has spread beyond the tough layer of tissue that surrounds and protects the kidney\nThere are 3 lymph node stages:\n- N0 – where no lymph nodes have been affected\n- N1 – where there are cancer cells in 1 lymph node\n- N2 – where there are cancer cells in 2 or more lymph nodes\nM0 means that the cancer hasn&#8217;t spread to another part of the body. M1 means that the cancer has spread.\nKidney cancer is graded using a scale of one to four. The higher the grade, the more aggressive the cancer.\nBeing diagnosed with cancer can be very distressing, particularly if it&#8217;s incurable. The news can often be difficult to take in and comprehend.\nAfter cancer has been diagnosed, you may find that talking to a counsellor or psychiatrist helps you deal with&nbsp;feelings of&nbsp;depression&nbsp;and&nbsp;anxiety.&nbsp;Antidepressants&nbsp;may also be used to help you through this process.\nRead more about&nbsp;coping with a cancer diagnosis. More information can be found on our pages about&nbsp;living with cancer.\nThe treatment of kidney cancer depends on the size and spread of the cancer. Surgery is the most common first course of action, with the aim of removing the cancer cells.\nUnlike most other cancers, chemotherapy isn&#8217;t very effective in treating kidney cancer. However, there are non-surgical treatments available, such as radiotherapy or targeted drug therapies.\nThe main treatments for kidney cancer include:\n- nephrectomy\n- embolisation\n- radiotherapy&nbsp;\n- targeted therapies&nbsp;\n- immunotherapy\nYou can expect to be cared for by a multidisciplinary team, often comprising a specialist cancer surgeon, an oncologist (who specialises in radiotherapy and&nbsp;chemotherapy), a radiologist, a nephrologist (a kidney specialist) and a specialist nurse.\nYou&#8217;ll be&nbsp;given a key worker, usually&nbsp;the specialist nurse, who will be responsible for coordinating your care.\nYour team will recommend what they think is the best treatment option, but the final decision will be yours.\nWhen deciding what treatment is best for you, your doctors will consider:\n- the&nbsp;stage and grade of your cancer&nbsp;(how big it is and how far it&#8217;s spread)\n- your age and general health\nIf the cancer hasn&#8217;t spread out of your kidney (T1 or T2 kidney cancer), it can usually be cured by removing some or all of the kidney.\nIf the cancer has spread out of your kidney (T3 or T4 kidney cancer), a complete cure may not be possible. However, it should be possible to slow the cancer&#8217;s progression and treat any symptoms.\nA nephrectomy is an operation to remove a kidney.\nIf the tumour is less than 4cm (1.5 inches) in diameter, it may only be necessary to remove some of your kidney. This is known as a partial nephrectomy. A partial nephrectomy may also be required if your remaining kidney is in poor health.\nIf the tumour is more than 4cm in diameter, your entire kidney will need to be removed. Even if the cancer has spread beyond your kidney, you may still benefit from having your kidney removed.\nRemoving the kidney can help resolve the pain, and make other types of non-surgical treatment more effective.\nIt&#8217;s possible to live a normal life with only 1 kidney, because the other kidney will be able to compensate.\nDuring a nephrectomy, the surgeon may also remove nearby lymph nodes to make sure the cancer hasn&#8217;t spread beyond the kidney.\nThere are 2 ways that both a partial and open nephrectomy can be performed They are an:\n- open nephrectomy – where the kidney is removed through a large incision in your abdomen (stomach)\n- laparoscopic or keyhole nephrectomy – where&nbsp;a series of smaller incisions are made in your abdomen, and the kidney is removed using small surgical instruments\nBoth techniques have advantages and disadvantages.\nA laparoscopic nephrectomy has a considerably quicker recovery time than an open nephrectomy.\nHowever, the procedure requires surgeons with specialised training, so you may have to wait longer to receive treatment than you would if you&nbsp;decided to have an open nephrectomy.\nSome types of kidney cancer, where the tumour is located in the centre of the kidney, may not be suitable for a laparoscopic nephrectomy.\nOne of the main disadvantages of an open nephrectomy is that it&#8217;s a major surgical procedure that can place a considerable strain on the body. This means it may not be suitable for people who are particularly frail or unwell.\nYou should discuss the pros and cons of both procedures with your surgical team.\nIf you&#8217;re unable to have a nephrectomy, you may benefit from an alternative&nbsp;operation known as embolisation.\nDuring embolisation, the surgeon will insert a small tube called a catheter into your groin, then use&nbsp;X-ray&nbsp;images to guide the catheter into the blood supply of your kidney. A substance will then be injected through the catheter to block the blood supply to your kidney.\nBy blocking blood supply to the kidney, any tumours that are present will become starved of oxygen and nutrients, causing them to shrink.\nKidney cancer is one of the few types of cancer that&#8217;s less responsive to&nbsp;chemotherapy&nbsp;(where powerful medication is used to kill cancerous cells).\nHowever, a number of&nbsp;clinical trials are underway that are looking at new combinations of chemotherapy medications that appear to be benefiting some people.\nThere are also a number of different non-surgical treatments that can slow the spread of the cancer and help control its symptoms.\nRadiotherapy&nbsp;can&#8217;t usually cure kidney cancer, but it can&nbsp;slow down its progress and help reduce pain. You should only need a few minutes of radiotherapy every day, for a number of days.\nWhen radiotherapy is used to control the symptoms of cancer rather than cure it, the side effects tend to be mild. Possible side effects may include fatigue (tiredness), nausea and vomiting.\nCryotherapy involves killing cancer cells by freezing them. It may be&nbsp;used if a person isn&#8217;t fit enough for surgery, or if their tumour is small.\nCryotherapy is usually classed as either percutaneous (where needles are&nbsp;passed through the skin) or laparoscopic (where needles are placed directly into the kidney through a small incision).\nSide effects include bleeding around the kidney and injury to the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder (the ureter).\nRadiofrequency ablation (RFA) uses heat generated by radio waves to kill cancer cells. This is a percutaneous treatment, meaning no incision is needed.\nThis treatment is only available at specialist centres. It&#8217;s mainly used if you&#8217;re not strong enough for surgery or your kidney cancer is in the early stages.\nRFA&nbsp;can&#8217;t be used if the cancer is too close to other organs, such as the bowel.\nSide effects include bleeding in the treatment area, a collection of blood (haematoma) near the kidney, and problems passing urine due to the narrowing of the tube that joins the kidney to the bladder (the ureter).\nA number of&nbsp;new medicines have been developed for the treatment of kidney cancer. These are:\n- sunitinib&nbsp;\n- pazopanib\n- axitinib\n- sorafenib\n- temsirolimus\n- everolimus\n- bevacizumab\nThese medicines are sometimes referred to as targeted therapies because they&#8217;re designed to target and interrupt the functions needed by cancer to grow and spread.\nAt present, only sunitinib, pazopanib and axitinib&nbsp;have been recommended by the&nbsp;National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). They&#8217;re available on the NHS for people who are still relatively healthy and have advanced kidney cancer, or kidney cancer that&#8217;s spread to other parts of their body.\nSorafenib, temsirolimus, everolimus and bevacizumab aren&#8217;t currently recommended by NICE.\nSunitinib is the most commonly prescribed treatment for kidney cancer. It’s a type of medication known as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Tyrosine kinase is an enzyme (protein) that helps cancer cells to grow. Sunitinib works by blocking protein kinase, stopping cancer from growing.\nSunitinib is taken as a capsule with or without food. You take it once a day for 4 weeks before having a 2-week break. This 6-week cycle is repeated for as long as the treatment is effective.\nIt’s very important that you take sunitinib in the exact dosage that’s been prescribed for you. Never stop taking medication for cancer without first consulting your specialist.\nCommon side effects of sunitinib include:\n- nausea\n- diarrhoea\n- high blood pressure (hypertension)\n- hair discolouration\n- mouth soreness\n- skin discolouration\n- skin rashes or blisters\nThe Cancer Research UK website has more information about sunitinib and its side effects.\nLike sunitinib, pazopanib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that can be used to slow down or stop the growth of cancer cells in the kidneys.&nbsp;It also prevents cancer cells from developing blood vessels, which they need to grow.\nPazopanib is taken as a tablet once a day with a glass of water. You should take it about the same time each day, either at least an hour before eating or 2 hours afterwards. It’s important that you take it in the exact dosage that your specialist has prescribed for you.\nCommon side effects of pazopanib include:\n- nausea\n- diarrhoea&nbsp;\n- high blood pressure\n- hair discolouration\n- abnormal liver function&nbsp;\nThe Cancer Research UK website has more information about&nbsp;pazopanib.\nAxitinib may be recommended for treating advanced kidney cancer if sunitinib and/or pazopanib have stopped working or haven’t been effective.\nLike sunitinib and pazopanib, axitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks tyrosine kinase and stops cancer growing.\nAxitinib is taken as a tablet with a glass of water twice a day, about 12 hours apart. Your specialist may start you on a low dose which, depending on how you feel, may be increased after 2 weeks. It’s very important that you take the exact dose that’s been prescribed for you.\nCommon side effects of axitinib include:\n- diarrhoea\n- nausea and vomiting\n- loss of appetite\n- tiredness\n- a decrease in thyroid hormone level (hypothyroidism)\n- headaches\n- weight loss\n- loss of fertility\nThe Cancer Research UK website has more information about&nbsp;axitinib.\nSorafenib is another tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks the protein, tyrosine kinase, which encourages cancer cells to grow. It also prevents cancer cells from developing blood vessels which they need to grow.\nSorafenib is taken as a tablet twice a day (at the same time each day) with a glass of water. It can also be taken with a meal, but make sure the food is low-fat, because high-fat foods make it less effective.\nAgain, it’s very important that you take sorafenib as instructed by your doctor at the exact dosage prescribed for you.\nCommon side effects of sorafenib include:\n- diarrhoea\n- fatigue\n- nausea and vomiting\n- hair thinning (in around one in four people)\n- increased risk of bleeding – such as&nbsp;nosebleeds&nbsp;or bleeding gums\n- loss of fertility\n- flushed skin\nThe Cancer Research UK website has more information about&nbsp;sorafenib.\nTemsirolimus is sometimes used to treat advanced kidney cancer. It’s a type of medication known as an mTOR inhibitor, which blocks a protein called mTOR, that’s usually active in cancer cells, making them reproduce and multiply. Temsirolimus also prevents blood vessels from developing, which cancer cells need to grow.\nTemsirolimus is a liquid that’s delivered directly into the bloodstream, either through a tube that’s put into a vein in your arm (catheter), or a tube into a large vein in your chest (a central line). The treatment takes 30&nbsp;to 60 minutes and you have it once a week in hospital. Before each dose, an antihistamine is usually given to prevent an allergic reaction.\nCommon side effects of temsirolimus include:\n- red, dry, itchy skin\n- nausea and vomiting\n- lack of appetite\n- diarrhoea\n- a sore mouth or&nbsp;mouth ulcers\n- sleeping problems\n- loss of fertility\nEverolimus is a medication for advanced kidney cancer that’s returned during or following treatment. It stops some of the signals produced within cells that make them grow and divide. Everolimus prevents the mTOR protein from working properly, which plays an important role in the growth of cancer cells.\nEverolimus is taken as a tablet once a day at the same time each day. It should be swallowed whole with a glass of water, rather than being chewed or crushed. It can be taken with or without food. It’s very important that everolimus is taken using the exact dosage and method prescribed.\nCommon side effects of everolimus include:\n- a sore mouth\n- tiredness\n- a rash or itchy, dry skin\n- loss of appetite\n- nausea and vomiting\n- a lack of&nbsp;periods in women (this may be temporary)\n- loss of fertility\nThe Cancer Research UK website has more information about&nbsp;everolimus.\nAs well as medications that prevent, disrupt and slow down the growth and development of kidney cancer (kinase and mTOR inhibitors), there are also treatments that work by encouraging the immune system to attack cancer cells. This type of treatment is known as immunotherapy.\nBevacizumab is a medication that’s given intravenously (into a vein, through a drip). It blocks a protein called endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which helps cancer to grow. Bevacizumab is usually used in combination with&nbsp;an immunotherapy treatment called interferon. Interferon is taken as an injection just under the skin (subcutaneously), three times a week. It encourages your immune system to attack and destroy the cancer cells.\nAnother medication called aldesleukin is sometimes used to treat kidney cancer that’s spread. It’s similar to a natural protein the body produces called interleukin-2 (IL-2), which is part of the immune system. IL-2 activates lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell), which fight illnesses and infections.\nAldesleukin works in a number of ways. It interferes with how cancer cells grow and multiply, it stimulates the immune system into attacking cancer cells, and it makes cancer cells send out chemicals that attract immune system cells. Like interferon, aldesleukin is usually given as a subcutaneous injection.\nImmunotherapy treatments are now rarely used to treat advanced kidney cancer. This is because targeted therapies tend to be more effective in controlling the condition, and immunotherapy can sometimes cause serious side effects.\nThe Cancer Research UK website has more information about treatments for advanced kidney cancer.\nAs the causes of kidney cancer aren&#8217;t fully understood, it&#8217;s not possible to completely prevent it.\nHowever,&nbsp;leading a healthy lifestyle may help reduce&nbsp;your chances of developing the condition.\nRead about the&nbsp;causes of kidney cancer.\nCombining a&nbsp;healthy diet&nbsp;and&nbsp;regular exercise&nbsp;will help you avoid becoming overweight&nbsp;or obese, which are both significant risk factors for kidney cancer.\nIf you&#8217;re overweight or obese, you can lose weight and maintain a healthy weight by combining regular physical activity&nbsp;with a calorie-controlled diet.\nRead more about&nbsp;healthy weight loss&nbsp;and&nbsp;treating obesity.\nA low-fat, high-fibre diet that includes whole grains and plenty of fresh&nbsp;fruit and vegetables&nbsp;(at least 5 portions a day) is recommended for a healthy heart.\nYou should also limit the amount of&nbsp;salt&nbsp;in your diet to no more than 6g (0.2oz or 1 teaspoon) a day. Too much salt will increase your blood pressure.\nAvoid eating foods high in&nbsp;saturated fat&nbsp;because it will increase your cholesterol level. High-fat foods include:\n- meat pies\n- sausages and fatty cuts of meat\n- butter\n- ghee – a type of clarified butter often used in Indian cooking\n- lard\n- cream\n- hard cheese\n- cakes and biscuits\n- foods that contain coconut or palm oil\nThere&#8217;s some evidence that eating a diet that has plenty of&nbsp;oily fish (at least 1 portion a week) may help reduce the risk of kidney cancer. Examples of oily fish include:\n- salmon\n- mackerel\n- sardines\n- trout\n- herring\nOily fish also contains&nbsp;vitamin D, which can reduce the risk of some cancers. You can also get&nbsp;vitamin D from sunlight or by taking supplements.\nIt&#8217;s recommended that adults should do a minimum of 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, such as&nbsp;cycling&nbsp;or&nbsp;brisk&nbsp;walking, every week.\nThe exercise should be strenuous enough to increase your heart rate&nbsp;and you should feel slightly out of breath afterwards.\nExamples of activities you could incorporate into your exercise programme include:\n- brisk walking\n- hill climbing\n- running\n- cycling\n- swimming\nIf you find it difficult to do 150 minutes of exercise a week, start at a level you feel comfortable with.\nHowever, you should visit your GP for a health check if you&#8217;ve never exercised before or you&#8217;re returning to exercise after a long period of time.\nRead more about&nbsp;exercise&nbsp;and its benefits.\nIf you smoke, giving up is the most effective way of preventing kidney cancer, as well as a number of other serious health conditions, such as stroke, heart attack and lung cancer.\nYour GP can help if you want to stop smoking, by giving you information and advice, and prescribing medication.\nOur&nbsp;stopping smoking pages&nbsp;have&nbsp;useful information and advice about giving up smoking. Alternatively, you can call&nbsp;Quit Your Way Scotland&nbsp;on 0800 84 84 84.\nRead more about&nbsp;giving up smoking.\nThere&#8217;s evidence to suggest that drinking a moderate amount of alcohol, such as&nbsp;4&nbsp;to 5 glasses of wine a month, will help reduce your risk of developing kidney cancer. The reasons for this aren&#8217;t fully understood.\nHowever, you shouldn&#8217;t exceed the recommended&nbsp;limits for alcohol, because excessive drinking will place you at risk of developing&nbsp;liver disease,&nbsp;liver cancer, and&nbsp;high blood pressure (hypertension).\nRead more about&nbsp;drinking and alcohol&nbsp;and&nbsp;alcohol units."

        "disease": "Kidney infection",
        "description": "A kidney infection&nbsp;(pyelonephritis) is a painful and unpleasant illness&nbsp;caused by bacteria travelling from your bladder into one or both of&nbsp;your kidneys.\nIt&#8217;s more serious than cystitis, a common infection of the bladder that makes urinating painful.\nIf treated promptly, a kidney infection doesn&#8217;t cause serious harm, but will make you feel very unwell. If a kidney infection isn&#8217;t treated, it can get worse and cause permanent kidney damage.\nSymptoms of a kidney infection often come on within a few hours. You can feel feverish, shivery, sick and have a pain in your back or side.\nRead more about the symptoms of a kidney infection\nSee your GP&nbsp;if you have a fever and persistent&nbsp;tummy, lower back&nbsp;or genital pain,&nbsp;or if you notice a change&nbsp;to your usual pattern of urination.\nMost kidney infections need&nbsp;prompt treatment with&nbsp;antibiotics to stop the infection from damaging the kidneys or spreading to the bloodstream. You may also need painkillers.\nIf you&#8217;re especially vulnerable to the effects of an infection, for example, if you have a pre-existing health condition or are pregnant, you may be admitted to hospital and treated with antibiotics through an intravenous drip.\nAfter taking antibiotics, you should feel completely better after about 2 weeks.\nIn rare cases, a kidney infection can cause further problems. These include blood poisoning (sepsis) and a build-up of pus in the kidney called an abscess.\nRead more about&nbsp;treating a kidney infection&nbsp;and the complications of a kidney infection\nA kidney infection usually happens when bacteria&nbsp;–&nbsp;often a type called&nbsp;E. coli&nbsp;–&nbsp;gets into the&nbsp;urethra (the tube which carries urine out of the body)&nbsp;and travels up through the bladder&nbsp;and&nbsp;into the kidneys.\nRead more about the causes of a kidney infection\nKidney infections are relatively rare. It&#8217;s estimated that one in every 830 people develops a kidney infection each year in the UK.\nThey can happen at any age, but are much more common in women. In fact, women are 6 times more likely to get a kidney infection than men. This is because a woman&#8217;s urethra is shorter, making it easier for bacteria to reach the kidneys.\nYounger women are most at risk because they tend to be more sexually active, and having frequent sex increases the chances of getting a kidney infection.\nYounger children are also vulnerable to developing kidney infections because they may be born with an abnormality of the urinary tract or have a condition called vesico-ureteric reflux, where there is a backflow of urine from the bladder up to the kidneys.\nYou can reduce your chances of developing a kidney infection by keeping your bladder and urethra free from bacteria. This can include drinking plenty of fluids, keeping your genitals clean and treating any constipation.\nRead more about preventing a&nbsp;kidney infection\nThe symptoms of a kidney infection usually develop quite quickly over a few hours or days.\nCommon symptoms&nbsp;include:\n- pain and discomfort in your side, lower back&nbsp;or around your genitals\n- high temperature (it may reach 39.5C or 103.1F)\n- shivering or chills\n- feeling very weak or tired\n- loss of appetite\n- feeling sick or being sick&nbsp;\n- diarrhoea\nYou may have other symptoms&nbsp;if you also have cystitis or urethritis&nbsp;(an infection of the urethra). These additional symptoms may include:\n- pain or a burning sensation during urination\n- need to urinate frequently or urgently\n- feeling that you&#8217;re unable to urinate fully\n- blood in your&nbsp;urine\n- cloudy or foul smelling urine\n- pain in your lower abdomen\nChildren with a kidney infection may also have additional symptoms, such as:\n- a lack of energy\n- irritability\n- poor feeding and/or vomiting\n- not growing at the expected rate\n- abdominal pain\n- jaundice&nbsp;(yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes)\n- blood in the urine\n- unpleasant smelling urine\n- bedwetting\nContact your GP if you have a high temperature, persistent pain, or if you notice a change to your usual pattern of urination. Contact your GP immediately if you think your child may have a kidney infection.\nIf you have blood in your urine, you should always see your GP so the cause can be investigated.\nKidney infections require prompt treatment with&nbsp;antibiotics to help relieve symptoms and prevent complications developing.\nYour GP can carry out some simple tests to help diagnose a kidney infection.\nSee&nbsp;diagnosing kidney infections&nbsp;for more information\nA kidney infection happens when bacteria infects your kidneys. The bacteria are usually a type called E. coli, which live in your bowel.\nThe bacteria&nbsp;get in&nbsp;through the opening of the urethra&nbsp;and move upwards through your urinary tract, first infecting your bladder and then your kidneys.\nIt&#8217;s thought the bacteria can get into your urinary tract by&nbsp;accidentally spreading from your anus to your urethra. This can happen if you wipe your bottom after going to the toilet and the soiled toilet paper comes into contact with your genitals. It can also happen during sex.\nIn rare cases, a kidney infection can develop if bacteria or fungi infect the skin and the infection spreads through your bloodstream into your kidney. However, this type of infection usually only occurs in people with weakened immune systems.\nWomen and children are most at risk of developing a kidney infection, as well as other urinary tract infections (UTIs) such as cystitis.\nIn women, the urethra is closer to the anus than in men, making it easier for bacteria from the anus to&nbsp;enter the urethra accidentally. The female urethra is also much shorter than the male urethra (which runs through the penis). This makes it easier for bacteria to reach the bladder and move into the kidneys.\nOther&nbsp;factors can also put you more at risk of developing a kidney infection, including:\n- having a condition that blocks, or obstructs, your urinary tract, such as kidney stones&nbsp;or an enlarged prostate&nbsp;– children with constipation can also be at an increased risk\n- being born with an abnormality in your urinary tract\n- having a condition that prevents you emptying your bladder fully, such as an injury to your spinal cord&nbsp;– this can allow bacteria in your bladder to multiply and spread\n- having a weakened immune system – for example, due to type 2 diabetes or as a side effect of chemotherapy\n- having an infection of the prostate gland called prostatitis&nbsp;–&nbsp;the infection can spread from the prostate gland into the kidneys&nbsp;\n- having a&nbsp;urinary catheter (a thin, flexible tube inserted into your bladder to drain away urine)\n- being female and sexually active&nbsp;– sexual intercourse can irritate the urethra and allow bacteria to travel into your bladder\n- being a man who has anal sex&nbsp;– bacteria can travel up the urethra into the bladder\n- being pregnant&nbsp;– this can cause physical changes that slow the flow of urine out of your body and make it easier for bacteria to spread to the kidneys\n- having undergone&nbsp;female genital mutilation (FGM)&nbsp;– an illegal practice where a&nbsp;woman&#8217;s genitals&nbsp;are deliberately cut or changed for cultural, religious and social reasons\nTo work out if you have a kidney infection, your GP will ask you about your symptoms and your recent medical history.\nThey will usually also assess your general health by taking your temperature and measuring your blood pressure.\nA urine test can help to establish&nbsp;whether you have a urinary tract infection (UTI). The test involves taking a small sample of urine and checking it to see if&nbsp;there are&nbsp;any bacteria in it.\nYou&#8217;ll be given a container and told how to collect the urine, which you can do in the surgery or at home. If you do it at home, you&#8217;ll need to label the container, seal it in a plastic bag and store it in the fridge. Ideally, hand it in to&nbsp;the surgery within four hours.\nA&nbsp;urine test can&#8217;t&nbsp;tell&nbsp;whether the infection&nbsp;– if&nbsp;you have one&nbsp;– is in your kidneys or another part of your urinary system, such as your bladder.\nFor your GP to be confident you have a kidney infection, you need to have a positive urine test plus&nbsp;certain symptoms, such as a fever or a pain in your side.\nYou may be referred to hospital for further testing if:\n- your symptoms fail to respond to treatment with antibiotics\n- your symptoms suddenly get worse\n- you have additional symptoms that aren&#8217;t usually associated with a kidney infection\n- you&#8217;re&nbsp;at risk of&nbsp;complications of a kidney infection\nChildren with recurrent UTIs&nbsp;will also be referred to hospital for further testing.\nIn these circumstances,&nbsp;scans can check your urinary tract for signs of problems. This may include:\n- a computer tomography (CT) scan – where&nbsp;a scanner takes a series of X-rays and a computer is used to assemble them into a detailed image of&nbsp;your urinary tract\n- an&nbsp;ultrasound scan – which uses sound waves to build&nbsp;an image of the inside of your body\n- an isotope scan – where&nbsp;a dye is injected into the bloodstream and a series of&nbsp;X-rays are taken\nRead more about treating a kidney infection\nMost people with a kidney infection can be treated at home with a course of antibiotics, and possibly painkillers as well.\nSee your GP if you have a fever and persistent tummy, lower back or genital pain, or if you notice a change to your usual pattern of urination.\nAll children with symptoms of a&nbsp;urinary tract infection (UTI)&nbsp;or kidney infection, including cystitis, should see their GP or out-of-hours emergency service.\nIf you&#8217;re being treated at home, you&#8217;ll usually be prescribed a course of antibiotic tablets or capsules that lasts between 7 and 14 days.\nFor most people&nbsp;–&nbsp;apart from pregnant women&nbsp;– antibiotics called ciprofloxacin&nbsp;or&nbsp;Co-amoxiclav&nbsp;are recommended. However, other antibiotics may also be used.\nCommon side effects of ciprofloxacin include feeling sick and diarrhoea.\nCo-amoxiclav&nbsp;can make the&nbsp;contraceptive pill and&nbsp;contraceptive patches less effective, so you may need to use another form of contraception during the course of treatment.\nA 14-day course of an antibiotic called cefalexin is recommended for pregnant women.\nUsually, you&#8217;ll start to feel better quite soon after treatment starts and you should feel completely better after about 2 weeks.\nIf your symptoms show no sign of improvement&nbsp;24 hours after treatment starts, contact your GP for advice.\nTaking&nbsp;a painkiller such as&nbsp;paracetamol should help relieve symptoms of pain and a high temperature.\nHowever, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen aren&#8217;t usually recommended to relieve pain during a kidney infection. This is because they&nbsp;may increase the risk of further kidney problems.\nIf you have a kidney infection, try not to &#8216;hover&#8217; over the toilet seat when you go to the loo, because it can result in your bladder not being fully emptied.\nIt&#8217;s also&nbsp;important to drink plenty of fluids, because this will help prevent dehydration and will help to flush out the bacteria from your kidneys. Aim to drink enough so that you&#8217;re frequently passing pale-coloured urine.\nMake sure that you get plenty of rest. A kidney infection can be physically draining, even&nbsp;if you&#8217;re normally healthy and strong. It may take up to two weeks before you&#8217;re fit enough to return to work.\nYour GP may refer you to hospital if you have an underlying problem with your urinary tract, which makes you vulnerable to kidney infections.\nIt&#8217;s standard practice to further investigate all men with a kidney infection simply because the condition is much rarer in men. Only women who have had 2 or more kidney infections tend to be referred. Most children with a kidney infection will be treated in hospital.\nHospital treatment may also be needed&nbsp;if:\n- you&#8217;re severely dehydrated\n- you&#8217;re unable to swallow or keep down any fluids or medications\n- you have additional symptoms that suggest you may have&nbsp;blood poisoning, such as a rapid heartbeat and losing consciousness\n- you&#8217;re pregnant and you also have a high temperature\n- you&#8217;re particularly frail and&nbsp;your general health is poor&nbsp;\n- your symptoms fail to improve within 24 hours of starting treatment with antibiotics\n- you have a weakened immune system\n- you have a foreign body inside your urinary tract, such as a kidney stone or a urinary catheter\n- you have diabetes\n- you&#8217;re over the age of 65\n- you have an underlying condition that affects the&nbsp;way your&nbsp;kidneys work, such as&nbsp;polycystic kidney disease or&nbsp;chronic kidney disease\nIf you&#8217;re admitted to hospital with a kidney infection, you&#8217;ll probably be attached to a drip so&nbsp;you can be given fluids to help keep you hydrated. Antibiotics can also be&nbsp;given through the drip.\nYou&#8217;ll have regular blood and urine tests to monitor your health and how effectively the antibiotics&nbsp;are fighting off the infection.\nMost people respond well to treatment. As long as there are&nbsp;no complications, they&#8217;re usually well enough to leave hospital within three to seven days.&nbsp;Treatment will usually switch to tablets or capsules after you stop receiving&nbsp;antibiotics through a drip.\nMost kidney infections are treated successfully without complications, although some people may develop further problems.\nComplications of a kidney infection are rare, but you&#8217;re more likely to&nbsp;develop them if you:\n- are a child\n- are&nbsp;over 65\n- are pregnant\n- have&nbsp;diabetes, chronic kidney disease&nbsp;or sickle cell anaemia\n- have had a kidney transplant&nbsp;(particularly in the first three months after the transplant)\n- have&nbsp;a weakened immune system\n- developed the kidney infection while in hospital\nA kidney&nbsp;abscess is&nbsp;a rare, but serious, complication of a kidney infection, where pus develops inside the tissue of the kidney.\nYou&#8217;re&nbsp;thought to be most at risk of developing a kidney abscess if you have diabetes.\nThe symptoms of a kidney abscess are similar to those of a kidney infection. The most common are:\n- a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above\n- chills\n- abdominal pain\n- loss of appetite\n- pain when passing urine\nKidney abscesses are potentially serious because the bacteria inside the abscess can spread to other parts of&nbsp;your body, such as&nbsp;your bloodstream or lungs, and can be fatal.\nSmaller abscesses can usually be treated with antibiotics through a drip. Surgery is usually required for larger abscesses. This involves draining&nbsp;the pus out of the abscess using a needle that&#8217;s inserted into the kidney.\nBlood poisoning (also called sepsis) is another rare, but potentially fatal, complication of a kidney infection.&nbsp;It happens when bacteria spreads from the kidneys into the bloodstream. Once bacteria are&nbsp;in your blood, the infection can spread to any part of your body, including all of the major organs.\nIn&nbsp;someone with a kidney infection, the&nbsp;symptoms of blood poisoning include:\n- low blood pressure, which makes you feel dizzy when you stand up\n- confusion or disorientation\n- excessive sweating\n- uncontrollable shaking or shivering\n- high temperature or lower body temperature than usual (under 36C, or 96.8F)\n- pale skin\n- rapid heartbeat\n- breathlessness\nBlood poisoning&nbsp;is a medical emergency that usually requires admission to a hospital&nbsp;intensive care unit (ICU) while antibiotics are used to fight the infection.\nIf you&#8217;re taking certain medications for diabetes, such as metformin or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, they may be temporarily withdrawn until you recover. This is because they can cause kidney damage during an episode of blood poisoning.\nAnother rare, but potentially fatal, complication of a kidney infection is a condition called emphysematous pyelonephritis (EPN).\nEPN is a severe infection, where the tissues of the kidneys are rapidly destroyed and the bacteria causing&nbsp;the infection begin to release a toxic gas, which builds up inside the kidneys.\nThe exact cause of EPN is unclear, but almost all cases&nbsp;are in people with diabetes.\nThe usual treatment is emergency surgery to remove some, or all, of the affected kidney. It&#8217;s possible to live&nbsp;a full and active life&nbsp;with only one kidney.\nIn very rare cases, a kidney infection can cause severe kidney damage that results in kidney failure. This is when the kidneys stop working properly.\nKidney failure is potentially fatal, but it can be treated with dialysis or a kidney transplant.\nA kidney infection can also cause other complications, including&nbsp;high blood pressure (hypertension)&nbsp;or premature labour or birth.\nThe best way to prevent a kidney infection is to keep your bladder and urethra free from bacteria.\nThese self-help tips explain how&nbsp;you can do this.\nDrinking plenty of liquids, particularly water, will help to wash bacteria from your bladder and urinary tract.\nDrinking cranberry juice or taking cranberry extracts may also help prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs).&nbsp;However, you should&nbsp;avoid cranberry juice or extracts if you&#8217;re taking warfarin, a medicine used to prevent blood clots.&nbsp;Cranberry juice can make the effects of warfarin more potent, so there&#8217;s a risk of excessive bleeding.\nTo help keep your&nbsp;urinary tract&nbsp;free from bacteria:\n- go to the toilet as soon as you feel the need to urinate, rather than holding it in\n- wipe from front to back after going to the toilet\n- practice good hygiene by washing your genitals every day and before having sex\n- empty your bladder after having sex\n- if you&#8217;re a woman, avoid &#8216;hovering&#8217; over a toilet seat as this position can often leave urine behind in the bladder\nConstipation can increase your chances of developing a urinary tract infection&nbsp;(UTI), so&nbsp;try to&nbsp;treat&nbsp;any constipation&nbsp;promptly.\nRecommended treatments for constipation&nbsp;include:\n- increasing the amount of fibre in your diet to 20g to 30g of fibre a day\n- using a mild&nbsp;laxative on a short-term basis\n- drinking plenty of fluids\nSee your GP if your symptoms don&#8217;t improve after 14 days (or 7 days for children with constipation).\nRead more&nbsp;about treating&nbsp;constipation\nIf you keep getting UTIs (more than 3 a year is considered high), avoid using spermicide-coated condoms or diaphragms. This is because spermicide can stimulate the production of bacteria.\nStick to&nbsp;lubricated condoms without spermicide,&nbsp;because unlubricated ones can irritate the urethra and make it more vulnerable to infection."

        "disease": "Kidney stones",
        "description": "Kidney stones can develop in one or both kidneys and most often affect people aged 30 to 60.\nThey&#8217;re quite common, with around 3 in 20 men and up to 2 in 20 women developing them at some stage of their lives.\nThe medical&nbsp;term for kidney stones is nephrolithiasis, and if&nbsp;they cause severe pain it&#8217;s known as renal colic.\nSmall kidney stones may&nbsp;go undetected and be passed out painlessly in the urine.&nbsp;But it&#8217;s fairly common for a stone to block part of the urinary system, such as the:\n- ureter – the tube connecting the kidney to the bladder\n- urethra – the tube urine passes through on its way out of the body\nA blockage can cause severe pain in the abdomen or groin and sometimes causes a urinary tract infection&nbsp;(UTI).\nRead more about the symptoms of kidney stones.\nThe waste products in the blood can occasionally form crystals that collect inside the kidneys. Over time, the crystals may build up to form a hard stone-like lump.\nThis is more likely to happen if you don&#8217;t drink enough fluids, if you&#8217;re taking&nbsp;some types of&nbsp;medication,&nbsp;or if you have&nbsp;a medical condition&nbsp;that raises the levels of certain substances in your urine.\nRead more about the causes of kidney stones.\nAfter a kidney stone has formed,&nbsp;your body&nbsp;will try to pass it&nbsp;out when you go to the toilet (in the urine). This means&nbsp;it will often travel through the urinary system (the kidneys, kidney tubes and bladder).\nMost kidney stones&nbsp;are small enough to be passed in your urine, and it may be possible to treat the symptoms at home with medication.\nLarger stones may need to be broken up using ultrasound or&nbsp;laser energy. Occasionally, keyhole surgery may be needed to remove very large kidney stones directly.\nRead more about treating kidney stones.\nIt&#8217;s estimated that up to half of all people who have had kidney stones will experience them again within the following 5 years.\nTo avoid getting kidney stones, make sure you drink plenty of water every day&nbsp;so you don&#8217;t become dehydrated. It&#8217;s very important to keep your urine diluted (clear) to prevent waste products forming into kidney stones.\nRead more about preventing kidney stones.\nVery small kidney stones are unlikely to cause many symptoms. It may even go undetected and pass out painlessly when you urinate.\nSymptoms usually occur if the kidney stone:\n- gets stuck in your kidney\n- starts to travel down the ureter (the tube that attaches each kidney to the bladder)&nbsp;– the ureter is narrow and kidney stones can&nbsp;cause pain as they try to pass through\n- causes an infection\nIn these cases, the symptoms of kidney stones can include:\n- a persistent ache in the lower back,&nbsp;which is sometimes also felt in the groin&nbsp;– men may have pain in their&nbsp;testicles and scrotum\n- periods of intense pain in the back or side of your abdomen, or occasionally in your groin, which&nbsp;may last for minutes or hours\n- feeling restless and unable to lie still\n- nausea (feeling sick)\n- needing to urinate more often than normal\n- pain when you urinate (dysuria)\n- blood in your urine (haematuria) – this&nbsp;may be caused by the stone scratching the kidney or ureter\nA kidney stone that blocks the ureter can lead to a kidney infection. This is because waste products are unable to pass the blockage, which may cause a build-up of bacteria.\nThe&nbsp;symptoms of a kidney infection&nbsp;are similar to symptoms of&nbsp;kidney stones, but may also include:\n- a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or over\n- chills and shivering\n- feeling very weak or tired\n- diarrhoea\n- cloudy and bad-smelling urine\nRead more about kidney infections.\nKidney stones are usually formed following a build-up of certain chemicals in the body.\nThis build-up&nbsp;may be any of the following:\n- calcium\n- ammonia\n- uric acid&nbsp;– a waste product produced when the body breaks down food to use as energy\n- cysteine&nbsp;– an amino acid that helps to build protein\nCertain medical conditions can lead to an unusually high level of these substances in your urine.\nYou&#8217;re also&nbsp;more likely to develop kidney stones if you don&#8217;t drink enough fluids.\nSome people are particularly likely to keep&nbsp;on developing kidney stones, including people who:\n- eat a high-protein, low-fibre diet\n- are&nbsp;inactive or bed-bound\n- have a family history of kidney stones\n- have had several kidney or urinary infections\n- have had a kidney stone before, particularly if it was before you were 25\n- have only one fully working kidney\n- have had an intestinal bypass (surgery on your digestive system), or a condition affecting the small intestine, such as&nbsp;Crohn&#8217;s disease\nThere&#8217;s evidence to suggest that certain medications may increase your risk of developing recurrent kidney stones. These include:\n- aspirin&nbsp;\n- antacids&nbsp;\n- diuretics (used to reduce fluid build-up)\n- certain antibiotics\n- certain antiretroviral medication&nbsp;(used to treat HIV)\n- certain anti-epileptic medication\nKidney stones can develop for a number of reasons.\nCalcium stones are the most common type of kidney stone and form if there&#8217;s too much calcium in the urine, which can be due to:\n- an inherited&nbsp;condition called hypercalcuria, which leads to&nbsp;large amounts of calcium in urine\n- an overactive parathyroid gland (the parathyroid glands help to regulate the amount of calcium in your body)\n- kidney disease\n- a rare condition called sarcoidosis&nbsp;\n- some cancers\nCalcium stones are usually either large and smooth or spiky and rough.\nStruvite stones are often caused by infections, and they most commonly occur after a&nbsp;urinary tract infection&nbsp;that&#8217;s lasted a long time.\nStruvite stones are more common in women than men.\nUric acid stones can form if there&#8217;s a large amount of acid in your urine. They may be caused by:\n- eating a high-protein diet that includes lots of meat\n- a condition&nbsp;such as gout&nbsp;that prevents the body breaking down certain chemicals&nbsp;\n- an inherited condition that causes higher than normal levels of acid in the body\n- chemotherapy\nCystine stones are the rarest type of kidney stone. They&#8217;re caused by an inherited condition called cystinuria, which affects the amount of acid that is passed in your urine.\nYour GP will usually be able to diagnose kidney stones from your symptoms and medical history.\nIt will be particularly easy if you&#8217;ve had kidney stones before.\nYou may be given tests, including:\n- urine tests to check for infections and pieces of stones\n- an examination of any stones that you pass in your urine\n- blood tests to check that your kidneys are working properly, and to also check the levels of substances that could cause kidney stones, such as calcium\nYou can collect&nbsp;a kidney stone by urinating through some gauze or a stocking.\nHaving a kidney stone to analyse will make a diagnosis easier, and may help your GP determine which treatment method will be of most benefit to you.\nIf you have severe pain that isn&#8217;t controlled by painkillers, or if you have a high temperature as well as pain, you may be referred to a urologist (a specialist in treating urinary problems).\nIf you&#8217;re&nbsp;referred to hospital for an imaging test,&nbsp;a number of different techniques may be used. Imaging tests can help confirm the diagnosis, or identify precisely where a kidney stone is.\nThese tests&nbsp;include:\n- a computerised tomography (CT) scan&nbsp;– where a series of X-rays at slightly different angles are taken and a computer is used to put the images together\n- X-ray&nbsp;– an imaging technique that uses high-energy&nbsp;radiation to highlight abnormalities in body tissue\n- an ultrasound scan&nbsp;–&nbsp;uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your body\n- an intravenous urogram (IVU) or intravenous pyelogram (IVP) – a dye that shows up on X-ray is injected into a vein in your arm; the X-ray image highlights any blockages as the kidneys filter the dye out of your blood and into your&nbsp;urine\nCT scans are now often used because they&#8217;re thought to be more accurate. IVUs were previously the preferred imaging method. The imaging technique you have may depend on what&#8217;s available at your local hospital.\nMost kidney stones are small enough (less than 4mm in diameter) to be passed out in your urine and can probably be treated at home.\nBut even small kidney stones can be painful, although this&nbsp;usually only lasts a couple of days and disappears when the stone has been passed.\nIf you are in severe pain, your GP can give you pain relief by injection. A second dose can be given after half an hour if you&#8217;re still experiencing pain.\nMedication can also be injected to treat the symptoms of nausea (feeling sick) and vomiting. This is called an anti-emetic (anti-sickness) medication.\nYou may also be given a prescription for painkillers, anti-emetics, or both, to take at home.\nYou may be advised to wait until you pass your kidney stone when you go to the toilet, and to try to collect it from your urine. You can do this by filtering your urine through gauze or a stocking.\nGive the stone to your GP so that they can have it analysed to help determine any further treatment you may need.\nYou should drink enough water to make your urine colourless. If your urine is yellow or brown, you&#8217;re not drinking enough.\nIf your kidney stone has moved into your ureter (the tube that carries waste products from the kidneys to the bladder), and it&#8217;s causing severe pain, your GP may admit you to hospital for treatment.\nThis may be necessary if:\n- you&#8217;re at an increased risk of your kidneys failing&nbsp;(for example, because you only have one kidney)\n- your symptoms don&#8217;t improve within an hour of being given painkillers or anti-sickness medication\n- you&#8217;re&nbsp;dehydrated and vomiting too much to keep fluids down\n- you&#8217;re pregnant\n- you&#8217;re over 60 years of age\nIf a kidney stone is too big to be passed naturally – 6mm to 7mm (about 0.23in to 0.27in) in diameter or larger – you may need treatment to remove it another way.\nThis could include:\n- extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL)\n- ureteroscopy\n- percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL)\n- open surgery\nThe type of treatment you have will depend on the size and location of your stones.\nESWL is the most common way of treating kidney stones that can&#8217;t be passed in the urine.\nIt involves using&nbsp;ultrasound (high-frequency sound waves) to pinpoint where a kidney stone is. Ultrasound shock waves are then sent to the stone from a machine to break it into smaller pieces, so it can be passed in your urine.\nESWL can be an uncomfortable form of treatment, so it&#8217;s usually carried out after giving painkilling medication.\nYou may need more than one session of ESWL to successfully treat your kidney stones. ESWL is up to 99% effective for stones up to 20mm (0.8in) in diameter.&nbsp;\nIf a kidney stone is stuck in the ureter, you may need to have a ureteroscopy, which is also sometimes known as retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS).\nIt&nbsp;involves passing a long, thin telescope called a ureteroscope through your urethra (the tube&nbsp;urine passes through on its way out of the body) and&nbsp;into your bladder. It&#8217;s then passed up into your ureter to where the stone is stuck.\nThe surgeon may either try to&nbsp;gently remove the stone using another instrument, or they may use laser energy to break it up into small pieces so that it can be passed naturally in your urine.\nUreteroscopy is carried out under general anaesthetic&nbsp;(where you&#8217;re unconscious), so you shouldn&#8217;t drive or operate machinery for up to 48 hours after the procedure.\nFor stones up to 15mm (0.6in), a ureteroscopy is effective in 50% to 80% of cases.\nA&nbsp;plastic tube called a stent may need to be&nbsp;temporarily inserted inside you to allow the stone fragments to drain into the bladder.\nPCNL is an alternative procedure that may be used for larger stones. It may also be used&nbsp;if ESWL isn&#8217;t suitable&nbsp;– for example, because the person being treated is obese.&nbsp;\nPCNL involves using a thin telescopic instrument called a nephroscope. A small incision is made in your back and the nephroscope is passed through it and into your kidney. The stone is either pulled out or broken into smaller pieces using a laser or pneumatic energy.\nPCNL is always carried out under general anaesthetic,&nbsp;so you shouldn&#8217;t drive or operate machinery for up to 48 hours after the procedure.\nPCNL is 86% effective for stones that are 21mm to 30mm (0.8in to 1.2in) in diameter.\nNowadays, open surgery for kidney stones is rare. Less than 1% of cases require this type of surgery. It&#8217;s only usually used if there&#8217;s a very large stone or abnormal anatomy.\nDuring open surgery, an incision will be made in your back so that your surgeon is able to access your ureter and kidney. The kidney stone can then be removed.&nbsp;\nIf you have a uric acid stone, you may be advised to drink around 3 litres (just over 5 pints) of water each day to try to dissolve it.\nUric acid stones are much softer than other types of kidney stone, and they can be made smaller if they&#8217;re exposed to alkaline fluids.\nYou&nbsp;may need to take some medication to make your urine more alkaline before the uric acid stone starts to dissolve.\nComplications can occur following the treatment of large kidney stones. Your surgeon should explain these to you before you have the procedure.\nPossible complications will depend on the type of treatment you have and the size and position of your stones.&nbsp;Complications could include:\n- sepsis&nbsp;– an infection that spreads through the blood, causing symptoms throughout the whole body\n- a blocked ureter&nbsp;– caused by stone&nbsp;fragments; the ureter is the tube that attaches the kidney to the bladder\n- an injury to the ureter\n- a urinary tract infection\n- bleeding during surgery\n- pain\nIt&#8217;s estimated that 5% to 9% of people may experience complications after having a ureteroscopy.\nThe best way of preventing kidney stones is to make sure you drink plenty of water each day to avoid becoming dehydrated.\nKeeping your urine diluted helps to stop waste products getting too concentrated and forming stones.\nYou can tell how diluted your urine is by looking at its colour. The darker your urine is, the more concentrated it is.\nYour urine is usually a dark yellow colour in the morning because it contains a build-up of waste products that your body has produced overnight.\nDrinks such as tea, coffee and fruit juice can count towards your fluid intake, but water is the healthiest option and is best for preventing kidney stones developing.\nYou should also make sure you drink more when it&#8217;s hot or when you&#8217;re exercising, to replenish fluids lost through sweating.\nRead more about preventing dehydration.\nIf your kidney stone is caused by too much calcium, you may be advised to reduce the amount of oxalates in your diet.\nOxalates prevent calcium being absorbed by your body, and can accumulate in your kidney to form a stone.\nFoods that contain oxalates include:\n- beetroot\n- asparagus\n- rhubarb\n- chocolate\n- berries\n- leeks\n- parsley\n- celery\n- almonds, peanuts and cashew nuts\n- soy products\n- grains, such as oatmeal, wheat germ and wholewheat\nDon&#8217;t reduce the amount of calcium in your diet unless your GP advises you to. This is because calcium is very important for maintaining healthy bones and teeth.&nbsp;\nTo avoid developing a uric acid stone, you should reduce the amount of meat, poultry and fish in your diet. You may also be prescribed medication to change the levels of acid or alkaline in your urine.\nIf you have a kidney stone, medication will usually be prescribed for pain relief or to prevent infections developing.\nHowever, some medication may need to be reviewed by your GP if it&#8217;s thought to be causing your kidney stone.\nThe type of medication your GP prescribes will depend on the type of kidney stone you have.\nFor example, if you have:\n- calcium stones –&nbsp;you may be prescribed a&nbsp;diuretic medication if they are caused by hypercalcuria (an inherited condition)&nbsp;\n- struvite stones –&nbsp;you may be prescribed antibiotics to help prevent a urinary tract infection or kidney infection, which are the main causes of struvite stones\n- uric acid stones – you may be prescribed allopurinol (a medication used to lower uric acid levels) and medication to help alkalise your urine\n- cystine stones – you may be prescribed medication to lower levels of cystine in&nbsp;your urine"

        "disease": "Labyrinthitis",
        "description": "Labyrinthitis is an inner ear infection. It causes the labyrinth inside your ear to become inflamed, affecting your hearing and balance.\nLabyrinthitis usually starts suddenly and can be worrying. You should seek medical advice straight away.\nThe labyrinth is the innermost part of the ear. It contains 2 parts:\n- the cochlea – this sends sounds to the brain so you can hear\n- the vestibular system – a complex set of fluid-filled tubes that affect your balance\nThe labyrinth usually becomes inflamed either because of:\n- a viral infection, such as a cold or flu (viral labyrinthitis)\n- a bacterial infection, which is much less common (bacterial labyrinthitis)\nThe most common symptoms of labyrinthitis are:\n- vertigo (dizziness) – the sensation that you, or the environment around you, is moving\n- hearing loss (from mild to total loss of hearing)\n- a feeling of pressure inside your ear(s)\n- ringing or humming in your ear(s) (tinnitus)\n- feeling sick (nausea) or being sick\n- mild headaches\nCertain things can make the dizziness worse, including:\n- colds or illness, or anything that makes you feel generally unwell\n- the dark\n- tiredness or jetlag\n- being on your period\nAvoid driving, using tools and machinery, or working at heights if you&rsquo;re feeling dizzy.\nYour GP may:\n- ask about your symptoms\n- check your medical history\n- carry out a physical examination – you may be asked to move your head or body and they can check your ears for signs of inflammation and infection\n- test your hearing – labyrinthitis is more likely if you have hearing loss\n- check your eyes – if they&#8217;re flickering uncontrollably your balancing system may not be working properly\nYou&#8217;ll usually have already seen your GP about labyrinthitis symptoms and may have started some treatment. There are things you can also do during this time to help manage your symptoms at home.\n\n\nIf your symptoms are particularly severe, your GP may prescribe:\n- prochlorperazine – can help with dizziness and sickness\n- antiemetic – can help if you&#8217;re feeling sick and vomiting\n- corticosteroids – can help by reducing inflammation\nA small number of people experience dizziness and vertigo for months or years. This is known as chronic labyrinthitis.\nChronic labyrinthitis requires a treatment called vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT). VRT is usually supervised by a physiotherapist. You can ask your GP to refer you or you can pay for private treatment. If you see a private physiotherapist, make sure they are fully qualified and a member of a recognised body. For example, the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP). Not all physiotherapists have training in VRT. You should tell them that you need this type of treatment before making an appointment.\nMost cases of viral labyrinthitis occur in adults aged 30 to 60 years old. Viral labyrinthitis is quite common in adults. Other types of ear infections are usually more common in children.\nBacterial labyrinthitis is much less common. Younger children under 2 years old are more vulnerable to developing bacterial labyrinthitis.\nMany people diagnosed with labyrinthitis only experience the balance symptoms without hearing loss.\nThis is known as vestibular neuronitis rather than labyrinthitis.\nBoth names are often used to describe the same diagnosis."

        "disease": "Lactose intolerance",
        "description": "Lactose intolerance is a common digestive problem where the body is unable to digest lactose, a type of sugar mainly found in milk and dairy products.\nSymptoms of lactose intolerance&nbsp;usually develop within a few hours of consuming food&nbsp;or drink that contains lactose. They may include:\n- flatulence (wind)\n- diarrhoea\n- bloated stomach\n- stomach cramps and pains\n- stomach rumbling\n- feeling sick\nThe severity of your symptoms and when they appear depends on the amount of lactose you&#8217;ve consumed.\nSome people may still be able to drink a small glass of milk without triggering any symptoms, while others may not even be able to have milk in their tea or coffee.\nThe symptoms of lactose intolerance can be similar to several other conditions, so it&#8217;s important to see your GP for a diagnosis before removing milk and dairy products from your diet.\nFor example, the symptoms above can also be caused by:\n- irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)&nbsp;– a long-term disorder that affects the digestive system\n- milk protein intolerance – an adverse reaction to the protein in milk from cows (not the same as a milk allergy)\nIf your GP thinks&nbsp;you&nbsp;have lactose intolerance,&nbsp;they may suggest avoiding foods and drinks containing lactose for two weeks to see if your symptoms improve.\nRead more about diagnosing lactose intolerance\nThe body digests lactose using a substance called lactase. This breaks down lactose into two sugars called glucose and galactose, which can be easily absorbed into the bloodstream.\nPeople with&nbsp;lactose intolerance&nbsp;don&#8217;t produce enough lactase, so lactose stays in the digestive system where it&#8217;s fermented by bacteria. This leads to the production of various gases, which cause the symptoms associated with lactose intolerance.\nDepending on the underlying reason why the body isn&#8217;t producing enough lactase, lactose intolerance may be temporary or permanent. Most cases that develop in adults are inherited and tend to be lifelong, but cases in young children are often caused by an infection in the digestive system and may only last for a few weeks.\nRead more about the causes of lactose intolerance\nIn the UK, lactose intolerance is more common in people of Asian or African-Caribbean descent.\nLactose intolerance can develop at any age. Many cases first develop in people aged 20 to 40, although babies and young children can also be affected.\nLactose&nbsp;intolerance isn&#8217;t the same as a milk or dairy allergy. Food allergies are caused by your immune system reacting to a certain type of food. This&nbsp;causes symptoms such as&nbsp;a rash, wheezing and itching.\nIf you&#8217;re allergic to something, even a tiny particle can be enough to trigger a reaction, while most people with lactose intolerance can still consume small amounts of lactose without experiencing any problems (although this varies from person to person).\nThere&#8217;s no cure for lactose intolerance, but limiting your intake of food and drink containing lactose usually helps to&nbsp;control the symptoms.\nDepending on what dairy products you&#8217;re able to eat, you may also require additional&nbsp;calcium&nbsp;and&nbsp;vitamin D&nbsp;supplements to keep&nbsp;your bones strong and healthy. In some cases, your GP may refer you to a dietitian for further advice.\nIn addition to dietary changes, lactase substitutes&nbsp;may&nbsp;also be helpful. These are&nbsp;drops or tablets you can take with your meals or drinks to improve your digestion&nbsp;of lactose.\nRead more about treating lactose intolerance\nMilk and other dairy products contain calcium, protein and&nbsp;vitamins such as A, B12 and D. Lactose also helps your body absorb a number of other minerals, such as magnesium and zinc. These&nbsp;vitamins and minerals are important for the development of strong, healthy bones.\nIf you&#8217;re lactose intolerant, getting the right amount of important vitamins and minerals can prove difficult. This may lead to unhealthy weight loss and&nbsp;put you at increased risk of developing the following conditions:\n- Osteopenia –&nbsp;where you have a very low bone-mineral density. If osteopenia is not treated, it can develop into osteoporosis.\n- Osteoporosis – where your bones become thin and weak. If you have osteoporosis, your risk of getting fractures and broken bones is increased.\n- Malnutrition – when the food you eat doesn&#8217;t give you the nutrients essential for a healthy functioning body. If you&#8217;re malnourished, wounds can take longer to heal and you may start to feel tired or depressed.\nIf you&#8217;re concerned that dietary restrictions are putting you at risk of complications, you may find it helpful to consult a dietitian. They can advise you on your diet and whether you require food supplements.\nYour GP should be able to refer you to an NHS dietitian free of charge. Alternatively, you can contact a private dietician. The British Dietetic Association has information on how to find a private dietitian.\nLactose intolerance is usually the result of your body not producing enough lactase.\nLactase is an enzyme (a protein that causes a chemical reaction to occur) normally produced in your small intestine that&#8217;s used to digest lactose.\nIf you have a lactase deficiency, it means your body doesn&#8217;t produce enough lactase.\nAfter eating or drinking something containing lactose, it passes down your oesophagus (gullet) into your stomach, where it&#8217;s digested. The digested food then passes into your small intestine.\nThe lactase in your small intestine should break lactose down into glucose and galactose (other types of sugar), which are then absorbed into your bloodstream. If there isn&#8217;t enough lactase, the unabsorbed lactose moves through your digestive system to your colon (large intestine).\nBacteria in the colon ferment (break down) the lactose, producing fatty acids and gases such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen and methane. The breakdown of the lactose in the colon, and the resulting acids and gases that are produced, cause the symptoms of lactose intolerance such as flatulence and bloating.\nThe main types of lactase deficiency are outlined below.\nPrimary lactase deficiency is the most common cause of lactose intolerance worldwide. This type of lactase deficiency is caused by an inherited genetic fault that runs in families.\nPrimary lactase deficiency develops when your lactase production decreases as your diet becomes less reliant on milk and dairy products. This is usually after the age of two, when breastfeeding or bottle-feeding has stopped, although the symptoms may not be noticeable until adulthood.\nSecondary lactase deficiency is a shortage of lactase caused by a problem in your small intestine. It can occur at any age, and may be the result of another condition, surgery to your small intestine, or taking certain medication.\nSecondary lactase deficiency is the most common cause of lactose intolerance in the UK, particularly in babies and young children.\nPossible causes of secondary lactase deficiency include:\n- gastroenteritis&nbsp;– an infection of the stomach and intestines\n- coeliac disease&nbsp;– a bowel condition caused by an adverse reaction to a protein called gluten\n- Crohn&#8217;s disease – a long-term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system\n- ulcerative colitis&nbsp;– a long-term condition that affects the large intestine\n- chemotherapy&nbsp;– a cancer treatment\n- long courses of antibiotics\nThe decrease in the production of lactase in secondary lactase deficiency is sometimes only temporary, but it may be permanent if it&#8217;s caused by a long-term condition.\nIt&#8217;s also possible to develop secondary lactase deficiency later in life, even without another condition to trigger it. This is because your body&#8217;s production of lactase naturally reduces as you get older.\nCongenital lactase deficiency is a rare condition that runs in families and is found in newborn babies.\nIt&#8217;s caused by an inherited&nbsp;genetic fault that means affected babies produce very little or no lactase.\nThe genetic mutation responsible for&nbsp;congenital lactase deficiency is passed on in an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. This means&nbsp;both parents must have a copy of the faulty gene to pass on&nbsp;the condition.\nSome babies born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy) have a temporary lactose intolerance because their small intestine wasn&#8217;t fully developed&nbsp;by the time they were born.\nThis is known as developmental lactase deficiency and it usually improves as&nbsp;affected babies get older.\nIt&#8217;s important to visit your GP if you think you or your child may have lactose intolerance, as the symptoms can be similar to other conditions.\nBefore seeing your GP, keep a diary of what you eat and drink, and what symptoms you experience. Tell your GP if you notice any patterns, or if there are any foods you seem particularly sensitive to.\nYour GP may suggest trying to&nbsp;remove lactose from your diet for two weeks to see if it helps to relieve your symptoms. This will provide further evidence&nbsp;of whether&nbsp;you&#8217;re lactose intolerant.\nOther tests aren&#8217;t usually needed, but your GP may sometimes suggest further tests to:\n- help confirm the diagnosis\n- find out how much lactase (the enzyme used to digest lactose) your body is producing\n- try to determine what might be causing your lactose intolerance\nSome of the main tests that may be&nbsp;used&nbsp;are described below.\nA hydrogen breath test is a simple way of determining if you may be lactose intolerant.\nYou&#8217;ll be asked to avoid eating or drinking during the night before the test. When you arrive for the test, you&#8217;ll be asked to blow up a balloon-like bag.&nbsp;This sample of your breath will be tested to find out how much hydrogen is present, measured in parts per million (ppm).\nYou&#8217;ll then be given a drink of lactose solution&nbsp;and your breath will be tested every 15 minutes over the next few hours to see if the level of hydrogen changes.\nIf your breath contains a large amount of hydrogen (more than 20ppm above your baseline) after consuming the lactose solution, it&#8217;s likely that you&#8217;re lactose intolerant. This is&nbsp;because&nbsp;lactose intolerance can cause the bacteria in the colon (large intestine) to produce more hydrogen than normal.\nIn a lactose tolerance test, you&#8217;ll be given a drink of lactose solution and a blood sample will be taken from your arm using a needle. The blood will be tested to see how much glucose (blood sugar) it contains.\nIf you&#8217;re lactose intolerant, your blood sugar levels will either rise slowly, or not at all. This is because your body is unable to break down the lactose into glucose.\nIn a milk tolerance test, you&#8217;ll be given a glass of milk (about 500ml) and your blood sugar levels will be tested. If your blood sugar levels don&#8217;t rise after drinking the milk, you may be lactose intolerant.\nA&nbsp;small bowel biopsy is rarely used to diagnose lactose intolerance. However, it may be carried out to see if your symptoms are being caused by another condition, such as&nbsp;coeliac disease.\nIn a small bowel biopsy, a sample of your small intestinal lining is taken using an&nbsp;endoscope (a thin, flexible tube with a light and a tiny cutting tool at the end) that&#8217;s passed down your throat. This will be carried out under&nbsp;local anaesthetic, so it won&#8217;t hurt.\nThe sample of intestinal lining will be tested to see how much lactase it contains. If it only contains a small amount of lactase,&nbsp;it&#8217;s likely you&#8217;re lactose intolerant. The sample can also be examined to look for signs of possible underlying conditions such as coeliac disease.\nThere&#8217;s no cure for lactose intolerance, but most people are able to control their symptoms by making changes to their diet.\nSome cases of lactose intolerance, such as those caused by gastroenteritis, are only temporary and will improve within a few days or weeks. Other cases, such as&nbsp;those caused by an inherited genetic fault or a long-term underlying condition, are likely to be lifelong.\nIn most cases, cutting down on or avoiding sources of lactose and replacing them with lactose-free alternatives is enough to control the symptoms of lactose intolerance.\nThe exact changes you need to make to your diet depend on how sensitive you are to lactose. Some people are able to tolerate some lactose in their diet without any problems, whereas others experience symptoms after consuming food containing only a tiny amount of lactose.\nIf you decide to experiment with what you can and can&#8217;t eat, make sure&nbsp;to introduce new foods gradually, rather than all at once. This will help you to get used to any foods you might be sensitive to and identify any that cause problems.\nEating fewer products containing lactose, or avoiding them completely, can mean you miss out on certain vitamins and minerals in your diet and increase your risk of complications. You&#8217;ll also need to make sure you&#8217;re getting enough&nbsp;nutrition from either lacto-free foods or dietary supplements.\nIf you or your child are extremely sensitive to lactose, talk to your GP about your diet.\nMilk products are rich in calcium needed for healthy bones so you may need to have regular bone density checks.\nYou may be referred to a dietitian (an expert in diet and nutrition) who&nbsp;can advise about what foods should be included in your, or your child&#8217;s, diet.\nSome of the main sources of lactose you may need to cut down on or avoid if you&#8217;re lactose intolerant are described below.\nA major source of lactose is milk, including cow&#8217;s milk, goat&#8217;s milk and sheep&#8217;s milk. Depending on how mild or severe your lactose intolerance is, you may need to change the amount of milk in your diet.\nFor example:\n- you may be able to have milk in your tea or coffee, but not on your cereal\n- some products containing milk, such as milk chocolate, may still be acceptable in small quantities\n- you may find that drinking milk as part of a meal, rather than on its own, improves how the lactose is absorbed\nIf even a small amount of milk triggers your symptoms, there are some alternatives you can try, such as soya or rice milk (see below).\nOther dairy products made from milk, such as butter, ice cream and cheese, can also contain high levels of lactose and may need to be avoided if you&#8217;re lactose intolerant.\nSome dairy products however, such as hard cheese and yoghurt, contain lower levels of lactose than milk and other products, so you may still be able to have them.\nIt&#8217;s worth experimenting with different foods to find out if there are any dairy products you can eat because they&#8217;re a good source of&nbsp;essential nutrients such as&nbsp;calcium.\nAs well as milk and dairy products, there are other foods and drinks that can sometimes contain lactose.\nThese include:\n- salad cream, salad dressing and mayonnaise\n- biscuits\n- chocolate\n- boiled sweets\n- cakes\n- some types of bread and other baked goods\n- some breakfast cereals\n- packets of mixes to make pancakes and biscuits\n- packets of instant potatoes and instant soup\n- some processed meats, such as sliced ham\nCheck the ingredients of all food and drink products carefully, because milk or lactose are often hidden ingredients.\nThe lactose found in some foods&nbsp;won&#8217;t necessarily be listed separately on the food label, so you need to check the ingredients list for milk, whey, curds and milk&nbsp;products such as cheese, butter and cream.\nSome ingredients may sound like they contain lactose when they don&#8217;t, such as&nbsp;lactic acid, sodium lactate and cocoa butter. These ingredients don&#8217;t need to be avoided if you&#8217;re lactose intolerant.\nSome prescription medicines, over-the-counter medicines and complementary medicines may contain a small amount of lactose. While this isn&#8217;t usually enough to trigger the symptoms of lactose intolerance in most people, it may cause problems if your intolerance is severe or you&#8217;re taking several different medicines.\nIf you need to start taking a new medication, check with your GP or pharmacist in case it contains lactose.\nThere are a number of alternative foods and drinks available in supermarkets to replace the milk and dairy products you need to avoid.\nFood and drinks that don&#8217;t usually contain lactose include:\n- soya milks, yoghurts and some cheeses\n- milks made from rice, oats, almonds, hazelnuts, coconut, quinoa, and potato\n- foods which carry the &#8216;dairy-free&#8217; or &#8216;suitable for vegans&#8217; signs\n- carob bars\nYou can also buy cow&#8217;s milk containing additional lactase (the enzyme used to digest lactose). This means you still get the nutritional benefits of the milk, but you&#8217;re less likely to experience any symptoms after consuming it.\nIf you&#8217;re unable to eat most dairy products, you may not be getting enough calcium in your daily diet.&nbsp;Calcium has several important functions, including:\n- helping build strong bones and teeth\n- regulating muscle contractions (including heartbeat)\n- ensuring blood clots normally\nTherefore, it&#8217;s a good idea&nbsp;to choose lactose-free products with added calcium and ensure your diet contains alternative sources of calcium, such as:\n- green leafy vegetables, such as spinach, kale, broccoli, cabbage and okra\n- soya beans\n- tofu\n- nuts\n- bread and anything made with fortified flour\n- fish containing edible bones (for example, sardines, salmon, and pilchards)\nYou can also buy combined calcium and vitamin D supplements from most pharmacists to help maintain good bone health.\nIt&#8217;s important to check with your GP or dietitian whether you should be taking supplements, however, as taking excessively high levels of calcium can cause side effects.\nIn addition to dietary changes, you may also find it useful to take&nbsp;liquid drops, tablets or capsules that contain&nbsp;lactase substitutes. These are available from most health foods shops.\nLactase substitutes replace the lactase your small intestine isn&#8217;t producing, which&nbsp;can reduce your symptoms by helping your body break down any lactose in your diet more easily.\nLactase substitutes&nbsp;can either be added to milk&nbsp;or taken just&nbsp;before eating a meal containing lactose.\nIf your child is lactose intolerant, they may be able to consume small amounts of lactose without experiencing symptoms. This is quite safe, but you may need to experiment to find out how much they can comfortably eat or drink.\nIf your child is unable to tolerate any lactose, your doctor&nbsp;may refer you to a dietitian for nutritional advice because it&#8217;s important&nbsp;for young children to have certain nutrients in their diet to ensure healthy growth and development.\nIn general, the same rules about foods to try or to avoid are similar for children and adults (see above).\nFor babies with lactose intolerance, lactose-free formula milk is available to buy from pharmacies and supermarkets. However, soya formula isn&#8217;t recommended for children under six months because it contains hormones that may interfere with your baby&#8217;s future physical and sexual development.\nBreastfed babies may benefit from lactase substitute drops to help their bodies digest the lactose in breast milk.\nFor many children, lactose intolerance is only temporary and will improve after a few weeks. After this point it&#8217;s safe to gradually reintroduce milk and dairy products into their diet.\nMilk and other dairy products are an important part of a healthy diet. They contain calcium, protein and vitamins such as vitamins A, B12 and D.\nLactose is also important because it helps your body absorb a number of other minerals, including magnesium and zinc. These vitamins and minerals are important for the development of strong, healthy bones.\nIf you are lactose intolerant, getting the right amount of important vitamins and minerals can prove difficult. This may lead to unhealthy weight loss and&nbsp;put you at increased risk of developing the following conditions.\n- Osteopenia – where you have a very low bone-mineral density. If osteopenia is not treated, it can develop into osteoporosis.\n- Osteoporosis – where your bones become thin and weak. If you have osteoporosis, your risk of getting fractures and broken bones is increased.\n- Malnutrition – when the food you eat does not give you the nutrients essential for a healthy functioning body. If you are malnourished, wounds can take longer to heal and you may start to feel tired or depressed.\nIf you are concerned that dietary restrictions are putting you at risk of complications, you may find it helpful to consult a dietitian. They can advise you on your diet and whether you require food supplements.\nYour GP should be able to refer you to an NHS dietitian free of charge. Alternatively, you can contact a private dietician. The British Dietetic Association has information on how to find a private dietitian."

        "disease": "Laryngeal (larynx) cancer",
        "description": "Laryngeal cancer is a type of cancer that affects the larynx (voice box).\nThe larynx is part of the throat found at the entrance of the windpipe (trachea). It plays an important&nbsp;role in helping you breathe and speak.\nThe condition is more common in people over the age of 60. It&#8217;s about 4 times more common in men than women.\nThe main symptoms of laryngeal cancer include:\n- a change in your voice, such as sounding hoarse\n- pain when swallowing&nbsp;or&nbsp;difficulty swallowing&nbsp;\n- a lump or swelling in your neck\n- a&nbsp;long-lasting cough\n- a persistent&nbsp;sore throat or earache\n- in severe cases, difficulty breathing\nSome people may also experience&nbsp;bad breath, breathlessness, a high-pitched wheezing noise&nbsp;when&nbsp;breathing, unexplained weight loss, or fatigue (extreme tiredness).\nYou should speak to your GP if you have had&nbsp;any of the main symptoms for more than 3 weeks.\nThese symptoms are often caused by less serious conditions, such as laryngitis, but it&#8217;s a good idea to get them checked out.\nIf necessary, your GP can refer you to a hospital specialist for further tests to confirm or rule out cancer.\nRead more about diagnosing laryngeal cancer.\nIt&#8217;s not clear exactly what causes laryngeal cancer, but your risk of getting the condition is increased by:\n- smoking tobacco\n- regularly drinking large amounts of alcohol\n- having a family history of head and neck cancer\n- having an unhealthy diet\n- exposure to certain chemicals and substances, such as asbestos and coal dust\nBy adopting a healthy lifestyle, including avoiding alcohol and tobacco, you can significantly reduce your chances of developing laryngeal cancer.\nRead more about the&nbsp;causes of laryngeal cancer&nbsp;and preventing laryngeal cancer.\nThe main treatments for laryngeal cancer&nbsp;are radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy.\nRadiotherapy or surgery to remove the cancerous cells from the larynx can often cure laryngeal cancer if it&#8217;s diagnosed early.\nIf the cancer is advanced, a combination of surgery to remove part or all of the larynx, radiotherapy and chemotherapy can be used.\nIf you have surgery to remove your larynx, you&#8217;ll no longer&nbsp;be able to speak or breathe in the usual way. Instead, you will breathe through a permanent hole in your neck (stoma) and you will need additional treatment to help restore your voice.\nThis may include an implant in your throat, or an electrical device&nbsp;you hold against your throat to produce sound.\nRead more about&nbsp;treating laryngeal cancer&nbsp;and recovering from laryngeal cancer surgery.\nLaryngeal cancer is caused by changes in the cells of the larynx, although it&#8217;s not clear exactly why this happens.\nAll cancers begin with a change in&nbsp;a cell&#8217;s&nbsp;DNA.&nbsp;DNA provides our cells with a basic set of instructions, such as when to grow and reproduce.\nA change in&nbsp;DNA can alter the instructions that control cell growth, which means cells continue to grow instead of stopping when they should. This causes the cells to reproduce in an uncontrollable manner, producing a growth of tissue called a tumour.\nIt&#8217;s not known why the DNA inside the cells of the larynx is affected in cases of laryngeal cancer. But it appears that exposure to&nbsp;things that can damage the cells and tissue of the larynx increases the risk of cancer developing.\nA&nbsp;number of things can increase your chances of developing laryngeal cancer.\nAlcohol and tobacco are the 2 main things that can increase your risk of developing laryngeal cancer. They&#8217;re&nbsp;thought to contain chemicals that can damage the cells of the larynx.\nThe&nbsp;more you drink or smoke, the higher your risk of developing laryngeal cancer.\nPeople who smoke more than 25 cigarettes a day, or people who have smoked for more than 40 years, have been found to be about 40 times more likely to develop laryngeal cancer than&nbsp;people who don&#8217;t smoke.\nCompared to people who don&#8217;t drink, people who regularly drink large amounts of alcohol are about 3 times more likely to develop laryngeal cancer.\nIf you drink and smoke, your risk of laryngeal cancer increases even further. By stopping both drinking and smoking, you can significantly reduce your risk of developing the condition. Read more about preventing laryngeal cancer.\nPeople who have a first-degree relative (parent, sibling or child) diagnosed with head or neck&nbsp;cancer are thought to be twice as likely to develop laryngeal cancer as someone without a family history.\nThere&#8217;s evidence to suggest that a diet high in red meat, processed food and fried food&nbsp;might increase your risk of developing laryngeal cancer.\nHaving&nbsp;a &#8216;Mediterranean diet&#8217; or a diet containing plenty of fruit and vegetables may reduce your risk.&nbsp;Read more about preventing laryngeal cancer.\nHuman papilloma virus (HPV)&nbsp;is the name given to a group of viruses that affect the skin and moist membranes that line the body, such as those in the cervix (neck of the womb), anus, mouth and throat.\nHPV is known to cause changes in the cells of the cervix, which can lead to&nbsp;cervical cancer. It&#8217;s thought the virus may have a similar effect on the cells of the throat. HPV is often spread during sex, including oral sex.\nHaving a job where you&#8217;re exposed to high levels of certain substances may also increase your risk of developing laryngeal cancer. These include:\n- asbestos\n- coal or wood dust\n- paint or diesel fumes\n- nickel\n- sulphuric acid fumes\n- formaldehyde (a chemical&nbsp;used in a wide range of industrial processes, such as paint manufacturing and cosmetics)\n- isopropyl alcohol (often used as a cleaning solvent)\nIf you have symptoms of laryngeal cancer, such as a hoarse voice and pain when swallowing, your GP will ask about your symptoms and recent medical history.\nThey may also examine the inside and outside of your throat for abnormalities, such as lumps and swellings.\nIf laryngeal cancer is suspected, you&#8217;ll probably be referred to the ear, nose and throat (ENT) department of your local hospital for further testing.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that&nbsp;anyone aged 45&nbsp;or over with persistent unexplained hoarseness or an unexplained lump in their neck should have an appointment with a specialist within 2 weeks.\nA nasendoscopy is a procedure used to get a clear view of your larynx.\nDuring the procedure, a small, flexible tube with a light and video camera at one end (endoscope) is&nbsp;inserted into your nostril and passed down the back of your throat. The images from the endoscope are displayed on a monitor.\nYou&#8217;ll usually be awake while this is carried out and it may feel uncomfortable.&nbsp;A&nbsp;local anaesthetic spray is&nbsp;sometimes used to numb your nose and throat beforehand, so you don&#8217;t feel any pain.\nIf it wasn&#8217;t possible to get a good view of your larynx during a nasendoscopy, or a possible problem is spotted, you may have a further test called a laryngoscopy.\nLike a nasendoscopy, this procedure involves using an endoscope to examine your larynx. However, the endoscope used during a laryngoscopy is longer and inserted through the mouth. This allows the larynx to be seen in greater detail.\nA laryngoscopy&nbsp;can be very uncomfortable, so it&#8217;s usually carried out under&nbsp;general anaesthetic (where you&#8217;re asleep). You should be able to leave hospital as soon as you&#8217;ve recovered from the effects of anaesthetic, which is usually the same day or the day after.\nDuring a&nbsp;nasendoscopy or&nbsp;laryngoscopy, your doctor may use small instruments to remove a sample of cells from your larynx so it can be examined for signs of cancer. This is known as a&nbsp;biopsy.\nAlternatively, if you have a lump in your neck, a needle and syringe can be used to&nbsp;remove a tissue sample. This is known as fine needle aspiration.\nIf the results of the biopsy show you have cancer and there&#8217;s a risk it may have spread, you&#8217;ll probably be referred for further testing to assess how widespread the cancer is. The tests may include:\n- a computerised tomography (CT) scan – a series of X-rays are taken to build up a more detailed three-dimensional picture of your larynx and the surrounding tissue\n- a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan –&nbsp;a strong magnetic field and radio waves are used to produce a more detailed image of your larynx and the surrounding tissue\n- a PET-CT scan&nbsp;– a CT scan is used to take pictures of the inside of your body after you&#8217;ve been injected with&nbsp;a mildly radioactive substance that helps to show cancerous areas more clearly\n- an ultrasound scan&nbsp;–&nbsp;high-frequency sound waves are used to check for signs of cancer in the lymph nodes (glands found throughout the body) near the larynx\nAfter these tests have been completed, your doctor should be able to tell you the extent of the cancer. This is known as the stage and grade of the cancer.\nHealthcare professionals use a system called the TNM system to stage laryngeal cancer. T describes the size of the tumour, N describes whether cancer has spread to the lymph nodes and M gives an indication of whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.\n- the T stage is given as a number from 1&nbsp;to 4 – small tumours confined to 1 part of the larynx are described as T1 tumours and large tumours that have grown into tissues outside the larynx are described as T4\n- the N stage is given as a number from 0&nbsp;to 3 – N0 means the lymph nodes are not affected, whereas stages N2 to N3 mean that 1 or more lymph nodes are affected\n- the M stage is given as either M0 or M1 – M0 means the cancer has not spread to other parts of the body and M1 means that it has\nThere are also 3 different grades&nbsp;(1&nbsp;to 3) used to describe&nbsp;laryngeal cancer. Lower-grade cancers, such as grade 1, tend to grow more slowly and are less likely to spread.&nbsp;Higher-grade cancers, such as grade 3,&nbsp;grow quickly and&nbsp;are more likely to spread.\nYou can read more about the stages, types and grades of laryngeal cancer on the Cancer Research UK website.\nThe treatment for laryngeal cancer largely depends on the size of the cancer. The main treatments are radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy.\nMost hospitals use multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) of specialists that work together to decide&nbsp;the best way to proceed with your treatment.\nMembers of your MDT will probably include a surgeon, a clinical oncologist (a specialist in the non-surgical treatment of cancer), and a specialist cancer nurse who will be responsible for co-ordinating your care.\nYour cancer team will recommend what they think is the best treatment option, but the final decision will be yours.\nBefore visiting hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions you&#8217;d like to ask&nbsp;your care team. For example, you may want to find out the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.\nYour recommended treatment plan will depend on the stage of the&nbsp;cancer (see diagnosing laryngeal cancer for more information on staging).\nIf you have early-stage laryngeal cancer, it may be possible to remove the cancer using surgery (endoscopic resection) or&nbsp;radiotherapy alone. This may also be the case with slightly larger cancers, although a combination of surgery and radiotherapy is sometimes required.\nIn later-stage laryngeal cancer, more extensive surgery may be needed. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy will probably be used in combination. In some cases, the entire larynx may have to be removed.\nA medication called cetuximab may be used in cases where chemotherapy is not suitable.\nRadiotherapy uses controlled doses of high-energy radiation to destroy cancerous cells. It can be used as a treatment on its own for early-stage laryngeal cancer, or it can be used&nbsp;after surgery to stop cancerous cells returning. It&#8217;s sometimes combined with chemotherapy.\nThe energy beams used during radiotherapy have to be precisely targeted to your larynx.&nbsp;To ensure&nbsp;the beams are directed at the exact area, a special plastic mask will be made to hold your head in the right position. A mould of your face will be taken so that the mask can be made before treatment starts.\nRadiotherapy is usually given in short daily sessions from Monday to Friday, with a break from treatment at the weekend. The course of treatment usually lasts for 3 to 7 weeks.\nAs well as killing cancerous cells, radiotherapy can affect healthy tissue and has a number of side effects, including:\n- sore, red skin (similar to sunburn)\n- mouth ulcers\n- dry mouth\n- loss of taste\n- loss of appetite\n- tiredness\n- feeling sick\nYour MDT will monitor any side effects and treat them when possible. For example, protective gels can be used to treat mouth ulcers, and medicines are available for a dry mouth.\nRadiotherapy can sometimes cause your throat tissue to become inflamed. Severe inflammation can cause breathing difficulties. Contact your key worker or visit&nbsp;your local accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department as soon as possible if you have difficulty breathing.\nMost side effects should pass within a few weeks of treatment finishing.\nRead more about&nbsp;radiotherapy.\nThere are 3 types of surgery that&nbsp;can be used to treat laryngeal cancer. They are:\n- endoscopic resection\n- partial laryngectomy\n- total laryngectomy\nEndoscopic resection can be used&nbsp;in&nbsp;early-stage laryngeal cancer.\nDuring the procedure, a surgeon uses a special microscope to get a magnified view of the larynx. This allows them to remove the cancer either with a laser or small surgical instruments.\nAn endoscopic resection is carried out under general anaesthetic, so you will&nbsp;be unconscious during the procedure and won&#8217;t feel any pain.\nYour&nbsp;mouth and throat&nbsp;may feel sore for a few weeks after the operation and there&#8217;s a risk of your voice changing as a result of the procedure, which can be permanent.\nA partial laryngectomy can be used to treat some laryngeal cancers. The operation involves surgically removing the affected part of your larynx. Some of your vocal cords will be left in place, so you will still be able to talk, but your voice may be quite hoarse or weak.\nWhile your larynx is healing, you may find breathing difficult. Your surgeon&nbsp;may need to&nbsp;create a temporary hole in your neck, which will be attached to a tube you can breathe through. This is known as a temporary tracheostomy.\nOnce your larynx has healed, the tube can be removed and the hole will heal, leaving a small scar.\nThis operation is&nbsp;uncommon nowadays,&nbsp;as endoscopic resection is preferred whenever possible.\nA total laryngectomy is usually used to treat advanced laryngeal cancer. The operation involves removing your entire larynx. Nearby lymph nodes (small glands that form part of the immune system) may also need to be removed if the cancer has spread to them.\nAs your vocal cords will be removed, you won&#8217;t be able to speak in the usual way after the operation. However, there are several ways to help restore your speech.\nIf you have a total laryngectomy, your surgeon will also need to create a permanent hole in your neck (called a stoma) to help you breathe after the operation.\nYou will be given training on how to keep your stoma clean. Having a stoma can seem daunting and frightening at first, but most people get used to it after a few months.\nSee recovering from laryngeal cancer for more information about speaking after surgery and looking after a stoma.\nChemotherapy uses powerful cancer-killing medicines to damage the DNA of the cancerous cells and stop them reproducing. It may be used to&nbsp;shrink a tumour before surgery or radiotherapy, or in combination with radiotherapy to make the radiotherapy more effective.\nIt can also be used to&nbsp;treat laryngeal cancer that&#8217;s advanced or has come back after treatment. In this situation, it can relieve symptoms and may slow the cancer&#8217;s growth.\nChemotherapy medication is usually given as an injection into a vein (intravenously) once every&nbsp;3&nbsp;or 4 weeks, for up to 6 months. You may need to stay in hospital for a few days&nbsp;during each treatment or you may just come in for a short visit each time.\nChemotherapy can sometimes damage healthy tissue as well as the cancerous tissue. This, unfortunately, means side effects are common, such as:\n- feeling and being sick\n- hair loss\n- loss of appetite\n- diarrhoea\n- sore mouth and mouth ulcers\n- tiredness\nChemotherapy can also weaken your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection and illness.\nIt&#8217;s therefore important to report any symptoms of potential infection to your&nbsp;MDT, such as a high temperature, chills or a persistent cough. You should also avoid close contact with people&nbsp;known to have an infection.\nThe&nbsp;side effects of chemotherapy should improve after your treatment has finished.\nRead more about&nbsp;chemotherapy.\nCetuximab is a type of medication called biological therapy. These medications target and disrupt the processes that cancerous cells use to grow and reproduce.\nCetuximab can be used in combination with radiotherapy to treat more advanced laryngeal cancer, when it&#8217;s not possible to use chemotherapy. For example, people with kidney or heart disease, or people with an ongoing infection, may not be able to have chemotherapy, because it could make them very ill.\nCetuximab is given slowly&nbsp;through a drip into your vein (intravenously) for up to an hour or more. It&#8217;s usually given weekly for&nbsp;up to 7 weeks.\nSide effects of cetuximab are usually mild and include:\n- rashes\n- feeling sick\n- diarrhoea\n- breathlessness\nCetuximab can also trigger allergic reactions in some people, which can cause problems such as a swollen tongue or throat. In a few cases,&nbsp;the reaction can be severe and potentially life-threatening.\nMost serious reactions occur within a day of treatment starting, so you&#8217;ll be closely monitored once your treatment begins. If you have symptoms of a severe&nbsp;reaction, such as a rapid heartbeat or breathing problems, medication can be used to relieve them (such as corticosteroids).\nIf you&#8217;ve had some or all of your larynx removed (laryngectomy), it&#8217;s likely that you&#8217;ll need to spend 1 or 2 days in an intensive care unit until you&#8217;ve recovered.\nYou won&#8217;t be able to eat until your throat has healed, which for most people&nbsp;takes at least&nbsp;a week or two. While your throat heals, you&#8217;ll need to be fed through a tube that&#8217;s passed&nbsp;through your nose and into your stomach.\nIf you&#8217;ve had all of your larynx removed&nbsp;(total laryngectomy), you won&#8217;t be able to speak normally, because you will no longer have vocal cords.&nbsp;A number of techniques can be used to replicate the functions of your vocal cords although they can take&nbsp;weeks or months to learn.\nTherefore, it&#8217;s likely that you&#8217;ll need to use alternative methods of communicating, such as using a pen or paper,&nbsp;during the first few weeks or months after surgery. This can be a frustrating experience – the loss of something you&#8217;ve previously taken for granted can be difficult to cope with.\nTry to prepare yourself for strangers reacting in unpredictable and possibly upsetting ways.&nbsp;Some people who have had a laryngectomy have reported that other people sometimes assume they&#8217;re deaf or have a learning difficulty because of their inability to speak.\nThe emotional impact of living with a laryngectomy can be significant. Many people report experiencing a rollercoaster effect.\nFor example, you may feel down when laryngeal cancer is diagnosed, then feel up after the cancer has been removed, then feel down again as you try to come to terms with the practicalities of living with a laryngectomy.\nThese emotional changes can sometimes trigger feelings of depression. You may be depressed if you have felt very down during the past month and you no longer take pleasure in doing&nbsp;things you enjoy.\nContact your GP or care team for advice if you think&nbsp;you may be depressed. There are a range of effective treatments available.\nThe National Association of Laryngectomee Clubs (NALC) is also a useful resource for people trying to come to terms with living with a laryngectomy. NALC is a patient support group that provides advice on all aspects of living with a laryngectomy.\nIf you&#8217;ve had all of your larynx removed, the surgeon will need to create a permanent hole in your throat through which you will breathe (a stoma). During the first few months after surgery, it&#8217;s likely that your stoma will produce a lot of mucus, particularly if you&#8217;ve had radiotherapy.\nExcessive mucus can cause breathing difficulties, so a tube may be attached to your stoma to help you breathe more easily. Once the production of mucus has settled down, the tube can be removed.\nIt&#8217;s important to clean your stoma at least once a day, otherwise it can become crusty and may become vulnerable to infection.&nbsp;A specialist nurse can teach you how to keep your stoma clean.\nYou&#8217;ll be given special filters to place over your stoma that can help keep your stoma moist and free of germs.\nIt&#8217;s important to remember that you&#8217;ll need to cover your stoma with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, rather than covering your mouth or nose. This is because mucus or saliva will come out of your stoma.\nIf your larynx has been completely removed as part of your treatment for laryngeal cancer, you&#8217;ll need additional treatment to help restore your voice.\nBefore your laryngectomy, you may meet a speech and language therapist (SLT) to discuss possible treatment options for restoring your voice. An SLT is a healthcare professional who specialises in helping people who have difficulties speaking and using language.\nThere are several different treatment options.\nA voice prosthesis is an artificial valve implanted into your neck. When you want to speak, you cover the stoma and breathe out through the valve.\nThe valve produces a noise, which you can use to make words by moving your lips and mouth in the usual way. The voice that&#8217;s produced by the valve sounds natural, although it may be lower-pitched than your previous voice.\nIf you choose to have a voice prosthesis, it can be fitted during the surgery to remove your larynx.\nOesophageal speech is a technique for speaking that your SLT can teach you. It involves learning to push air&nbsp;through your oesophagus (gullet). As the air moves through your oesophagus, it vibrates and makes a noise. You can produce words by moving your lips and mouth.\nSome people find it quite easy to learn oesophageal speech, whereas others find it difficult. Regular practice by yourself and with your SLT can help you&nbsp;improve.\nAn electrolarynx is a small, battery-operated electrical device that vibrates and produces sound. You hold the device under your chin, and as you move your mouth and lips the vibrations translate into spoken words. Your SLT can train you to use it correctly.\nIt&#8217;s thought that most laryngeal cancers can be prevented by adopting a healthy lifestyle.\nAvoiding&nbsp;tobacco products, cutting down on how much alcohol you drink and&nbsp;having a healthy diet are particularly important in reducing your chances of developing the condition.\nUsing tobacco products increases your chances of developing several different types of cancer, including laryngeal cancer.\nTobacco comes in many forms, including:\n- cigarettes\n- pipe tobacco\n- cigars\n- cigarillos\n- snuff (powdered tobacco&nbsp;snorted through the nose)\n- chewing tobacco\nIf you smoke or use other tobacco products, stopping will have both short- and long-term health benefits, including significantly reducing your risk of developing laryngeal cancer.\nIf you decide to stop smoking your free NHS&nbsp;stop smoking service&nbsp;can help you give up. You can also call Quit Your Way Scotland&nbsp;on&nbsp;0800 84 84 84 for&nbsp;free expert advice and support.\nIf you want to stop&nbsp;smoking, but don&#8217;t want to be referred to a stop smoking service, your GP should be able to prescribe medical treatment to help with any withdrawal symptoms you may have.\nRead more about stopping smoking.\nStaying within the recommended guidelines for alcohol consumption will also reduce your risk of developing laryngeal&nbsp;and liver cancers.\nStudies have found that your risk of developing laryngeal cancer reduces significantly within 5&nbsp;to 10 years of not drinking, and after 20&nbsp;to 30 years your risk is about the same as someone who has never drunk alcohol.\nContact your GP if you&#8217;re finding it difficult to reduce the amount of alcohol you drink. You may need additional treatment, which could include counselling, group work or medication.\nRead more about&nbsp;treatments for alcohol misuse&nbsp;and tips on cutting down how much you drink.\nResearch shows a diet that contains plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, particularly tomatoes, citrus fruit (such as oranges, grapefruits and lemons), olive oil and fish oil,&nbsp;may reduce your risk of getting laryngeal cancer. This type of diet is sometimes known as a &#8216;Mediterranean diet&#8217;.\nEating plenty of fruit&nbsp;and vegetables each day may help to reduce your chances of developing many types of cancer, including laryngeal cancer.\nRead about&nbsp;food and diet and healthy eating for more information and advice.\n"

In most cases, it gets better without treatment in about a week.\nSymptoms of laryngitis can begin suddenly and usually get worse over a period of 2 to 3 days.\nCommon symptoms of laryngitis include:\n- hoarseness\n- difficulty speaking\n- sore throat\n- mild fever\n- irritating cough\n- a constant need to clear your throat\nThe hoarse voice and speaking difficulties usually get worse each day you’re ill. They may last for up to a week after the other symptoms have gone.\nIn a few cases, the larynx can swell and cause breathing difficulties. This isn’t common in adults but can happen in young children who have smaller, narrower windpipes.\nLaryngitis is often linked to another illness. For example, a cold, flu, throat infection or tonsillitis. So you might also have other symptoms such as:\n- a headache\n- swollen glands\n- runny nose\n- pain when swallowing\n- feeling tired and achy\nYou or your child:\nIf you see your GP, they’ll discuss the possible causes with you and may refer you for tests or to a specialist in hospital.\nIn some cases, it may be possible to treat the underlying cause of laryngitis. For example, if the symptoms are caused by an allergic reaction, you may be able to:\n- avoid the thing you’re allergic to\n- take medication to help control your allergy\nIn most cases, laryngitis is caused by either:\n- a viral infection – such as a cold or flu\n- irritation to your larynx – for example by straining your voice or reflux\nIn these cases, most of the symptoms usually pass within a week. This is known as acute laryngitis.\nLaryngitis can occasionally last much longer. This is known as chronic laryngitis. Chronic laryngitis can be caused by:\n- smoking\n- alcohol misuse\n- reflux\nAs laryngitis is often caused by a common viral infection, such as a cold or flu, it’s not always possible to prevent it.\nThere are things you can reduce your risk of developing the condition."

        "disease": "Late miscarriage",
        "description": "A late miscarriage happens after 12 weeks and before 24 weeks.\nRead more about early miscarriage (when you miscarry before 12 weeks)\nRead more about stillbirth (when your baby dies after 24 weeks or during birth)\nIf you&rsquo;re registered, contact your midwife or local maternity unit. If you&rsquo;re not registered, contact your GP or NHS 24 on 111.\nSigns of a late miscarriage can include:\n- vaginal bleeding\n- strong cramping pain\n- a gush or trickle of liquid from your vagina\n- your baby&#8217;s movements changing, like slowing down or stopping\nExperiencing these miscarriage symptoms does not mean that you&#8217;re definitely having a late miscarriage. But, you should contact your maternity service if you&#8217;re concerned. If you&#8217;re not registered yet, contact your GP. If your GP is closed, phone NHS 24 on 111.\nIt&#8217;s possible to first discover you&#8217;ve lost your baby during an antenatal appointment. This does not mean you missed the symptoms of a miscarriage. Some people have a later miscarriage without experiencing symptoms.\nMost of the time there’s no clear reason why a miscarriage happens, but it’s unlikely to be caused by anything you did or did not do.\nRead more about the causes of a miscarriage\nIf you&#8217;re experiencing a late miscarriage, you may go into very premature labour. If this doesn’t happen, your doctor or midwife might recommend that your labour is induced (started by a midwife or doctor).\nIf the loss of your baby has been found during a scan or another appointment, you may be offered different options for how you want to proceed. You may be able to:\n- choose to have an induction (to have labour started) as soon as possible\n- choose to delay induction until you&#8217;ve gone home and seen family members\n- choose expectant management, where you go home and wait for labour to start naturally\nYour doctor or midwife will support you with the information you need to choose what&#8217;s right for you.\nIf you choose expectant management, they&#8217;ll make sure you know what to look for and when to attend hospital. They&#8217;ll also give you guidance on what to do if labour doesn&#8217;t start, and what you can expect your baby to look like when they&#8217;re born.\nSometimes, you&#8217;ll not be able to choose to wait to deliver your baby. This might be the case if:\n- you&#8217;re bleeding heavily and continuously\n- you&#8217;re showing signs of infection\n- your waters have broken\nIf you&#8217;re having an induction you&#8217;ll have to go into hospital.\nThe doctor or midwife caring for you will explain what to expect. They can tell you about pain relief and how long labour might take.\nInduction is usually a 2-stage process. First you&#8217;ll be a given a medicine called mifepristone. This is a tablet that you swallow. After taking this, you may be able to go home and return 36-48 hours later to start labour. This is because it takes 36-48 hours for the mifepristone to work best.\nWhen you return, you&#8217;ll be given prostaglandin tablets every few hours until you have regular contractions. You will then go through labour, and your baby will be born.\nEveryone responds differently to induction. For some the labour and birth happens quickly, for others it can take several hours.\nThink about what emotional support you&#8217;ll need. A partner, friend or family member can stay with you throughout. Your doctor or midwife will discuss this with you.\nThere&#8217;s no right or wrong thing to do. It depends on how you (and your partner, if you have one) feel. Your doctor or midwife will discuss your options with you, and can make suggestions about memory making. Take some time to think about it beforehand if you can.\nYou might be unsure about what your baby will look like. The doctor or midwife looking after you can describe your baby. Depending on how far along in your pregnancy you are, you may be able to see and hold them if you want to. You may also ask medical professionals to take a photo for you to look at later in private.\nIt may not be possible to tell the sex of your baby. This is something you can talk about with your doctor or midwife. Some people prefer to think of their baby as one sex or the other. There’s no right or wrong way to approach this.\nYou may also like to invite other family members to spend time with your baby. It is, however, your choice. Whatever you choose, the medical professionals caring for you will support your choices.\nThere is no formal registration process for babies lost before 24 weeks. However, you can record your loss in the Memorial Book of Pregnancy and Baby Loss Prior to 24 Weeks.\nIf you lose your baby before 24 weeks, there&#8217;s no legal requirement to have a burial or cremation. The decision about what happens is a very personal one for you and your loved ones. You&#8217;ll be guided through this process by the healthcare professionals looking after you.\nSome hospitals do offer burials and cremations for babies lost before 24 weeks. This may be a shared cremation, which is when your baby is cremated with other babies rather than alone. You can ask your healthcare professional about the arrangements at your hospital. If you opt for hospital cremation, you&#8217;ll be given written information about your options.\nYou may want to make your own arrangements. Some people choose to use a funeral director or specialist cremation service. Others choose to bury the remains or scatter the ashes at home or somewhere else that is meaningful to them.\nYou might not be ready to decide right now. There’s no rush and those caring for you will help you make decisions at a pace that feels right for you. They should also give you a person to contact in case you change your mind, and let you know how long you have to make any changes.\nYou may be offered tests for both you and your partner. These will try to find out why you lost your baby. Your doctor or midwife will explain what your test results are, and what they mean for a future pregnancy if you want to get pregnant again.\nYour doctor or midwife may also offer to carry out a post-mortem on your baby. This will only be done with your permission.\nIn many cases, tests and a post-mortem are unlikely to explain why you had a miscarriage. But, they may rule out some possibilities and perhaps reassure you if you want to try to get pregnant again in the future.\nIt&#8217;s important to remember that most people are likely to have a successful pregnancy in the future, particularly if their test results are normal.\nThere are physical changes to your body that you may experience after a late miscarriage.\nYour breasts may produce milk in the first few days after your miscarriage. It can make them feel very large, tight, painful and tender.\nTo help reduce the amount of milk you produce you could try:\n- applying ice packs (or a bag of frozen peas) covered in a light cloth to your breasts\n- wearing a well-fitting bra\n- using pain relief like ibuprofen or paracetamol\n- expressing small amounts by hand (just enough to ease the pain, otherwise you&#8217;ll encourage the production of more milk)\n- taking a warm shower, which may encourage your milk to leak naturally.\nYou may find it helpful to wear breast pads for the first few days.\nYou may be able to get medication to suppress your milk, though these are not suitable for everyone. Speak to the doctor or midwife treating you if you&#8217;d like further information.\nSome people decide to donate their milk to help other babies. Donated breastmilk helps other babies whose mothers are unable to give breastmilk. Some people find some comfort in being able to help others.\nRead more about donating breast milk\nIt’s common to have after-pains after a late miscarriage. They can feel similar to labour contractions, cramps or strong period pains. This is your womb contracting back to its normal size and usual location (down inside your pelvis). Painkillers, like paracetamol, can help with this.\nAfter the miscarriage, you&#8217;ll bleed from the vagina. This type of bleeding is called lochia. It&#8217;s your body&#8217;s way of removing the tissue that formed to help your baby grow. It includes:\n- the lining of your womb\n- blood from where your placenta was attached\nThis bleeding is likely to be heavy for around 2 weeks and then lighter for a further 4-6 weeks. It may have some small lumps or clots in it. The colour will change from red, to pink, to brown.\nThe flow of this bleeding can increase and decrease. Do not worry if you find you have lighter days followed by heavier days. This is normal.\nDuring this time, you should use external period products (like pads) rather than internal period products (like tampons). This can help to avoid infection.\nContact your maternity unit if:\n- you&#8217;re filling a large sanitary pad in 1 to 2 hours\n- you&#8217;re passing blood clots larger than a £2 coin\nIt&#8217;s hard to say when your first normal period will happen. It’s likely it will be about 4 to 6 weeks after your miscarriage. It can sometimes be hard to know whether it&#8217;s lochia, or your first period.\nSometimes your first period is different than your normal period. This isn&#8217;t unusual. There&#8217;s no need to be concerned.\nYou may find that your first period reminds you of your miscarriage. Some people find this upsetting, while others find it a welcome sign that they can try to conceive again.\nIf you do find it distressing, there&#8217;s support available to help you.\nThere&#8217;s no right or wrong way to feel after a miscarriage. You, your partner (if you have one), and other members of your family, may be feeling grief, shock and sadness. You may find it helpful to look for more support from specialist organisations.\nRead more about support after a miscarriage"

        "disease": "Leg cramps",
        "description": "Leg cramps are a common and usually harmless condition. They cause the muscles in your leg to suddenly become tight and painful.\nA leg cramp is an episode of sudden pain in the muscles of the leg. It&#8217;s caused by an involuntary contracting (shortening) of the leg muscle.\nCramps usually occur in the calf muscles, although they can affect any part of your leg. This includes your feet and thighs. Cramps can last from a few seconds up to 10 minutes. Thigh muscle cramps tend to last the longest.\nDuring a cramping episode, the affected muscles will become tight and painful and the feet and toes will be stiff.\nAfter the cramping has passed, you may have pain and tenderness in your leg for several hours.\nCramps often happen during the night when you&#8217;re sleeping.\nLeg cramps might be a sign of a more serious health condition.\nIf your GP is closed, phone 111.\nYour GP will ask about your symptoms and examine your legs and feet. They may also ask if you have other symptoms, like numbness or swelling. This may be a sign that you have secondary leg cramps caused by an underlying condition.\nIn this case, you may need further tests, like blood tests and urine tests, to rule out other conditions.\nThe cause of leg cramps is sometimes unknown (idiopathic). In other cases, there may be an underlying condition or identifiable cause (secondary leg cramps).\nIdiopathic leg cramps may be caused by:\n- abnormal nerve activity during sleep\n- excessive strain placed on leg muscles, for example during exercise\n- a sudden restriction in the blood supply to the affected muscles\nAlso, tendons naturally shorten over time as a person gets older. This may explain why older people are particularly affected by leg cramps. Tendons are tough bands of tissue that connect muscles to bone. If your tendons become too short, they may cause the muscles connected to them to cramp.\nSecondary leg cramps are caused by an underlying condition or another identifiable cause like:\n- pregnancy – the extra weight of pregnancy can place strain on the leg muscles, making them more vulnerable to cramping\n- exercise – leg cramps are often experienced when resting after exercise\n- neurological conditions – for example, motor neurone disease or peripheral neuropathy\n- liver disease – if your liver stops working properly, toxins will build up in your blood, which can make your muscles spasm\n- infection – some types of bacterial infection, like tetanus, can cause muscle cramps and spasm\n- toxins – in some people, high levels of toxic (poisonous) substances in the blood, like lead or mercury, can cause leg cramps\n- dehydration – in some people, low levels of water in the body can lead to a drop in your salt levels, which can trigger muscle cramps\nMedication is usually only needed in persistent cases where cramping does not respond to exercise.\nIf you have secondary leg cramps, treating the underlying cause may help relieve your symptoms.\nLeg cramps that occur during pregnancy should pass after the baby is born.\nTreating cramps that occur as a result of serious liver disease can be more difficult. Your treatment plan may include using medications like muscle relaxants.\nCertain medications have been known to cause leg cramps in a small number of people. If you develop leg cramps after starting a new medication, speak to your pharmacist.\nNever stop taking a prescribed medication unless your GP or healthcare professional advises you to do so.\nMost cases of leg cramps can be relieved by exercising the affected muscles. Exercising your legs during the day will often help reduce how often you get cramping episodes.\nTo stretch your calf muscles:\nIf you often get leg cramps, regularly stretching the muscles in your lower legs may help prevent the cramps or reduce their frequency.\nYou might find it useful to stretch your calves before you go to bed each night.\nIf you lie on your back, make sure that your toes point upwards. Placing a pillow on its side at the end of your bed, with the soles of your feet propped up against it may help keep your feet in the right position.\nIf you lie on your front, hang your feet over the end of the bed. This will keep your feet in a relaxed position. It&#8217;ll help stop the muscles in your calves from contracting and tensing.\nKeep your sheets and blankets loose."

        "disease": "Lichen planus",
        "description": "Lichen planus is a non-infectious, itchy rash that can affect many areas of the body.\nAffected areas can&nbsp;include the:\n- arms, legs and trunk&nbsp;\n- mouth (oral lichen planus)\n- nails and scalp\n- vulva, vagina and penis\nThe exact cause of lichen planus is unknown. However, the condition isn&#8217;t infectious and doesn&#8217;t usually run in families. It can&#8217;t be passed on to other people, including sexual partners.\nA&nbsp;GP can usually&nbsp;diagnose lichen planus by examining the rash and asking about your symptoms. Oral lichen planus is often diagnosed by a dentist during routine dental check-ups.\nLichen planus is thought to affect 1-2% of the worldwide population. It&#8217;s more common in adults over the age of 40.\nLichen planus of the skin affects men and women equally. However, oral lichen planus is more common in women. The mouth is affected in around 50% of all cases of lichen planus (oral lichen planus).\nThere&#8217;s no single treatment that can cure lichen planus completely. However, treatments are available to help manage the symptoms and make living with it easier. For example, steroid creams or ointments are often used to help relieve the itch and control the rash.\nMost cases of lichen planus of the skin clear up on their own within 6&nbsp;to 9&nbsp;months. The rash rarely lasts longer than 18 months.&nbsp;However, oral lichen planus and lichen planus that affects the genital area may be more persistent.\nRead&nbsp;more&nbsp;about how lichen planus is treated.\nErosive lichen planus is a rare form of lichen planus that can last a long time. It causes painful ulcers to develop in the mouth and in the genital areas of both&nbsp;males and females.\nIn some cases, long-term erosive lichen planus can increase the chance of&nbsp;some types of&nbsp;cancer developing.\nRead our page on&nbsp;complications of lichen planus for more information about erosive lichen planus.\nThe symptoms of lichen planus vary, depending on which area of the body is affected.\nAreas of the body most commonly affected by the condition include the:\n- skin\n- mouth\n- penis\n- vulva (external female sex organs) and vagina\nThe symptoms of lichen planus of the skin are:\n- purple-red coloured bumps (papules) that are slightly raised, shiny and have a flat top. The papules usually measure 3-5mm in diameter and may also have irregular white streaks (Wickham&#8217;s striae)\n- thicker scaly patches can appear, usually around the ankles – this is known as hypertrophic lichen planus\n- itchy skin\nLichen planus of the skin often affects the wrists, ankles and lower back, although other parts of the body can also be affected.\nThickened (hypertrophic) lichen planus affects the shins, and ring-shaped lichen planus affects creases in the skin, such as the armpits.\nAfter the&nbsp;papules have cleared, the affected area of skin can sometimes become discoloured.\nThe symptoms of oral lichen planus are:\n- a white pattern on the tongue and inner cheeks\n- red and white patches in the mouth\n- burning and discomfort in the mouth while eating or drinking\n- painful red gums\nMild cases of oral lichen planus don&#8217;t usually cause any pain or discomfort.\nThe symptoms of lichen planus of the penis are:\n- purple or white ring-shaped patches on the tip of the penis (glans)\n- bumps (papules) that are flat-topped and shiny\n- a non-itchy rash\nThe symptoms of lichen planus of the vulva and vagina include:\n- soreness, burning and rawness around the vulva\n- the vulva may be covered in white streaks and be a red, pink or pale white colour\n- if the vagina is affected, sexual intercourse can be painful\n- if the outer layers of skin break down, moist, red patches can form\n- scar tissue can form, which distorts the shape of the vagina\n- a sticky yellow or green discharge,&nbsp;which may be bloodstained\n- the opening of the vagina can become narrowed\nLichen planus can sometimes affect other areas, including:\n- the nails – which can become thinner, ridged and grooved, or they may become darker, thicker or raised; they may sometimes shed or stop growing\n- the scalp – red patches can appear around clusters of hair; in some cases, permanent&nbsp;hair loss can occur\nThe cause of lichen planus is unknown.\nIt&#8217;s thought&nbsp;to be related to the immune system, or an abnormal response of the immune system to certain medicines.\nLichen planus isn&#8217;t infectious, doesn&#8217;t usually run in families and can&#8217;t be passed on to others.\nThe immune system protects your body against illness and infection&nbsp;by producing antibodies (proteins)&nbsp;that attack bacteria and viruses.\nIn people with lichen planus, it&#8217;s thought that the immune system becomes overactive, causing an excess amount of proteins to be produced, which inflame the skin. This is known as an autoimmune reaction and causes the symptoms of lichen planus.\nA reaction to certain medications is another possible cause of lichen planus. For example:\n- gold injections – these are disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) that are sometimes injected into the muscles of people with arthritis to help reduce inflammation and painful joints\n- antimalarial tablets – these help treat and prevent malaria (a serious tropical disease spread by mosquitoes)\nLichen planus is often diagnosed by a GP or dentist examining the affected area.\nYour GP may be able to make a diagnosis based on the characteristic rash.&nbsp;However, lichen planus can be mistaken for other skin conditions, such as eczema,&nbsp;which also causes the skin to become red, flaky and itchy.\nIf your doctor&nbsp;is unable to make a confident diagnosis by examining your skin, they may want to take a small skin sample (biopsy), which will be examined under a microscope.\nIf a skin biopsy is required, you&#8217;ll be given a&nbsp;local anaesthetic to numb the affected area so you don&#8217;t feel any pain or discomfort during the procedure.\nA dentist or doctor can diagnose oral lichen planus by looking at the inside of your mouth.\nA biopsy may be recommended to confirm the diagnosis. A sample&nbsp;of&nbsp;mouth tissue will be removed so that it can be examined under a microscope.&nbsp;As with lichen planus of the skin, you&#8217;ll be given a local anaesthetic to numb the pain.\nThere&#8217;s no cure for lichen planus, so treatments aim to ease the symptoms and clear the rash. Mild lichen planus doesn&#8217;t require treatment.\nBelow is some general self-help advice that can help ease your symptoms and prevent them getting worse.\n- avoid washing with soap or bubble bath – use plain warm water instead\n- wash your hair over a basin to stop affected areas of skin coming into contact with shampoo\n- use an&nbsp;emollient to moisturise your skin&nbsp;\n- avoid eating spicy foods and anything acidic, such as fruit juice, because they can irritate oral lichen planus\n- avoid eating sharp food, such as crusty bread\n- avoid drinking alcohol,&nbsp;particularly spirits\n- if areas of your mouth are painful, stick to soft, bland foods, such as mashed potatoes and porridge\n- if possible, continue to use your usual toothpaste\n- avoid using mouthwashes that contain alcohol because they may be too strong, and keep your mouth as clean as possible\n- visit your dentist regularly to help keep your teeth and gums healthy\n- avoid washing with soap or bubble bath – use plain warm water or a soap substitute instead, such as aqueous cream\n- use an emollient, such as petroleum jelly, before and after urinating\n- applying ice packs to the affected areas may soothe itching&nbsp;and swelling (never apply an ice pack directly to your skin – wrap&nbsp;it in a clean tea towel before placing&nbsp;it on your body)\n- women should avoid wearing tights\nThere are a number of&nbsp;medications&nbsp;and treatments that may be recommended for lichen planus of the skin, hair and nails. These are outlined below. &nbsp;\nCorticosteroid creams and ointments contain corticosteroids (artificial hormones) and are used to treat inflammatory skin conditions. They are often referred to as topical corticosteroids.\nTopical corticosteroids help treat the&nbsp;swelling (inflammation) and redness caused by lichen planus. Strong topical corticosteroids, such as clobetasol propionate, are also effective in reducing any itchiness you may have.\nTreatment is applied to the red or purple itchy spots, but should be stopped when the colour of the rash changes to brown or grey. This pigment change occurs when the inflammation has settled. Continuing to apply the corticosteroid cream to the brown areas of skin will&nbsp;gradually cause the skin to thin. The side effects of corticosteroids can vary, depending on the:\n- type and severity of treatment being used\n- how long the treatment is used for\n- nature of the condition being treated\nPotential side effects of topical corticosteroids can include:\n- redness or burning and stinging of the skin\n- skin rash\n- thinning of the skin (atrophy)\n- stretch marks (striae)&nbsp;\n- contact dermatitis – a condition that causes skin inflammation\n- excessive hair growth (hypertrichosis)\n- lightening of the skin\nAlways check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine.\nCorticosteroid tablets are sometimes used to treat severe cases of lichen planus, when the symptoms aren&#8217;t being effectively controlled with creams or ointments.\nPossible side effects of corticosteroid tablets used on a short-term basis can include:\n- increased appetite\n- weight gain\n- insomnia\n- fluid retention (inability to pass urine)\n- mood changes, such as feeling irritable or anxious\nOther treatments&nbsp;recommended for lichen planus of the skin are outlined below.&nbsp;\n- Antihistamines – these are often used to treat symptoms of allergies, such as itchy skin. If you have lichen planus of the skin that&#8217;s causing itchiness, antihistamines may be prescribed to help reduce this.\n- Light treatment – there are 2&nbsp;types of light treatment: ultraviolet B (UVB) and psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA). UVB is the most commonly used light treatment, but PUVA may be recommended in severe or widespread cases of lichen planus that don&#8217;t respond to other types of treatment.&nbsp;\n- Acitretin – this medication is only prescribed by a specialist and is used to treat severe cases of lichen planus. The tablets have some associated side effects and may not mix well with other medicines. Your specialist can offer advice.\nMild cases of oral lichen planus won&#8217;t need any treatment. In more severe cases, treatment includes:\n- a mouthwash that contains an anaesthetic to temporarily numb the mouth, which makes eating easier\n- corticosteroid sprays, mouthwashes, pastes and dissolvable lozenges\n- a mouthwash or gel that contains an antiseptic to help prevent the build-up of plaque in your mouth\nIn more severe cases of oral lichen planus, corticosteroid tablets may also be used on a short-term basis.\nIt can be difficult to prevent oral lichen planus, but to keep the lining of your mouth healthy it&#8217;s recommended that you:\n- stop smoking (if you smoke)\n- avoid drinking large amounts of alcohol\n- have a healthy, balanced diet, including plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables\nYou should also maintain good oral hygiene by cleaning your teeth at least twice a day, and having regular dental check-ups, so that any problems with your teeth or mouth can be identified and treated early.\nIf corticosteroids are not effective in treating your symptoms, you may be prescribed a medication that suppresses your immune system to try to limit the autoimmune reaction that&#8217;s thought to cause lichen planus.\nThese types of treatments are known as immunomodulating agents. Depending on which area of your body is affected by lichen planus, treatments that may be recommended for you can include: treatments such as tacrolimus&nbsp;\n- topical immunomodulating agents&nbsp;(used to treat lichen planus of the skin) – treatments such as tacrolimus&nbsp;ointment and&nbsp;pimecrolimus cream are rubbed directly onto the skin\n- immunomodulating agents&nbsp;(used to treat lichen planus of the mouth) – these are usually available in the form of tablets or capsules, and can be used to treat severe cases of oral lichen planus\nThese treatments can cause&nbsp;a number of different side effects, which your specialist can discuss with you.\nYou&#8217;ll also need to have regular blood tests while taking immunomodulating agents, particularly in&nbsp;the early stages of treatment.\nYou can find support and information from organisations like:\n- Changing Faces – a charity for people who have a visible difference or facial disfigurement, who can be contacted on 0300 012 0275 for counselling and advice\nComplications of lichen planus may include discoloured skin and, in some cases, erosive lichen planus may develop into certain types of cancer.\nAfter the lichen planus rash has cleared up, the affected area of skin may be a different colour to what it was originally. There may be a brown or grey mark, which can sometimes last for months. This is known as post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, and tends to be more noticeable in people with darker skin.\nErosive lichen planus is a long-lasting (chronic) form of lichen planus that causes painful ulcers to develop, as well as burning and discomfort in the genital areas of both&nbsp;male and females.\nOccasionally, in around 2% of cases, long-term cases of erosive lichen planus can develop into certain types of&nbsp;cancer, such as:\n- mouth cancer&nbsp;&nbsp;\n- vulval cancer&nbsp;\n- penile cancer\nRegularly examining yourself and being aware of any changes that occur will help you to identify any problems at an early stage. Pay close attention to ulcerated areas in your mouth or genitals that don&#8217;t heal and persist for a long time. Visit your GP immediately if you notice any changes that you&#8217;re concerned about.\nYou should also visit your dentist regularly to ensure that your teeth and gums remain healthy, and that any ulcers or patches that form in your mouth are examined and treated promptly. Depending on individual circumstances, dental&nbsp;check-ups for adults&nbsp;are recommended anywhere between every 3 to 24 months.\nRead more about&nbsp;treating lichen planus, including self-help tips for managing all types of the condition."

        "disease": "Liver cancer",
        "description": "Primary liver cancer is an uncommon but serious type of cancer that begins in the liver.\nThis is a separate condition from secondary liver cancer, which occurs when cancer that first develops in another part of the body spreads to the liver.\nThe rest of this article refers to primary liver cancer only. The Macmillan Cancer Support website has more information about secondary liver cancer.\nSymptoms of&nbsp;liver cancer are often vague and don&#8217;t appear until the cancer is at an advanced stage. They can&nbsp;include:\n- unexplained weight loss\n- loss of appetite\n- feeling very full after eating, even if the meal was small\n- feeling sick and vomiting\n- pain or swelling&nbsp;in your abdomen (tummy)\n- jaundice (yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes)\n- itchy skin\n- feeling very tired and weak\nSpeak to your GP if you notice any of these symptoms. Although they are more likely to be the result of a more common condition, such as an infection, it&#8217;s best to have them checked.\nYou should also contact your GP if you have previously been diagnosed with a condition known to affect the liver, such as cirrhosis or a hepatitis C infection, and your health suddenly deteriorates.\nThe exact cause of liver cancer is unknown, but most cases are associated with damage and scarring of the liver known as cirrhosis.\nCirrhosis can have a number of different causes, including drinking&nbsp;excessive amounts of alcohol over&nbsp;many years and having a long-term hepatitis B&nbsp;or&nbsp;hepatitis C&nbsp;viral infection.\nIt is also believed obesity and an unhealthy diet&nbsp;can increase the risk of liver cancer because this can lead to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\nBy avoiding or cutting down on alcohol,&nbsp;eating healthily and&nbsp;exercising regularly, and taking steps to reduce your risk of becoming infected with hepatitis B and C, you may be able to significantly reduce your chances of developing liver cancer.\nRead more about the causes of liver cancer.\nDespite being a common type of cancer worldwide, liver cancer is relatively uncommon in the UK. However, the chances of developing the condition are high for people with risk factors for the condition.\nThe number of people affected by liver cancer rises sharply with age, with around 8 in every 10 cases diagnosed in people aged 60 or older, although it also affects many people younger than this. Around 2 in every 3 cases affect men.\nOver the past few decades, rates of liver cancer in the UK have risen considerably, possibly as a result of increased levels of alcohol intake and obesity.&nbsp;\nLiver cancer is usually diagnosed after a consultation with a GP and a referral to a hospital specialist for further tests, such as scans of your liver.\nHowever, regular check-ups for liver cancer (known as surveillance) are often recommended for people known to have a high risk of developing the condition, such as those with cirrhosis.\nHaving regular check-ups helps ensure the condition is diagnosed early. The earlier&nbsp;liver cancer is diagnosed, the more effective&nbsp;treatment is likely to be.\nRead&nbsp;more about diagnosing liver cancer.\nTreatment for liver cancer depends on the stage the condition is at. If diagnosed&nbsp;early, it may be possible to remove the cancer completely.\nTreatment options in the early stages of liver cancer include:\n- surgical resection – surgery to remove a section of liver\n- liver transplant&nbsp;– where the liver is replaced with a donor&#8217;s liver\n- microwave or radiofrequency ablation – where microwaves or radio waves are used to destroy the cancerous cells\nHowever, only a small proportion of liver cancers are diagnosed at a stage where these treatments are suitable. Most people are diagnosed when the cancer has spread too far to be removed or completely destroyed.\nIn these cases, treatments such as chemotherapy will be used to&nbsp;slow down&nbsp;the spread of the cancer and relieve symptoms such as pain and discomfort.\nRead more about&nbsp;treating liver cancer.\nThe exact cause of liver cancer is unknown, but many cases are linked to a problem with the liver called cirrhosis. This is where the tissue of the liver has become scarred and cannot perform many of its usual functions.\nCancer is a condition&nbsp;where cells in a specific part of the body grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue known as a tumour.\nIn cases of liver cancer, it is uncertain why and how the cells of the liver are affected, but it appears that cirrhosis can increase a person&#8217;s chances of developing the condition.\nHowever, most cases of cirrhosis do not lead to liver cancer, and people without cirrhosis can&nbsp;also develop liver cancer.\nThe liver is a tough and resilient organ. It can endure a high level of damage that would destroy other organs and is capable of regenerating itself. But despite the liver&#8217;s resilience, excessive alcohol intake over many years can damage it.\nEvery time you drink alcohol, your liver filters out the poisonous alcohol from your blood and some of the liver cells die. The liver can regenerate new cells, but if you drink heavily for many years, your liver will lose the ability to do this and it can become damaged and scarred over time.\nNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease&nbsp;occurs when small deposits of fat build up inside the tissue of the liver.&nbsp;It&#8217;s a&nbsp;common condition and causes no noticeable symptoms in most people.\nHowever, in some people, high levels of fat can make the liver inflamed. Over time, the inflammation&nbsp;can scar the liver.\nThe exact cause of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is unclear, but it is associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes.\nA long-term infection of hepatitis C&nbsp;can cause inflammation and scarring of the liver.&nbsp;\nHepatitis C is spread by blood contact. The most&nbsp;common ways this happens worldwide&nbsp;include poor medical practice with the use of contaminated needles, or injected drug use, where any item of injecting equipment (not just needles) is shared.\nIf you smoke or regularly drink alcohol and have hepatitis C, your risk of developing liver cancer further increases.\nEarly treatment of long-term hepatitis C with antiviral medication can prevent the liver from becoming scarred.\nHepatitis B&nbsp;is a virus that can be spread through contaminated blood and other types of bodily fluids, such as saliva, semen and vaginal fluids.\nLike hepatitis C, hepatitis B is spread through blood contact. It is most commonly spread from mother to child at birth or from child to child in early life (usually in areas outside the UK where the infection is very common), and very rarely sexually or through injecting drugs.\nIt affects about&nbsp;1 in every 200 people&nbsp;in the UK. Most of those infected were born in&nbsp;parts of the world where the hepatitis B&nbsp;virus is very common.\nAs with hepatitis C, hepatitis B can also cause inflammation and scarring of the liver over time.\nIf you smoke or drink and have hepatitis B, your risk of developing liver cancer further increases.\nEarly treatment of long-term hepatitis B with antiviral medication is not always needed, but can substantially reduce the risk of the liver becoming scarred.\nHaemochromatosis&nbsp;is a genetic condition where the body stores too much iron from food.\nThe excess levels of iron have a poisonous effect on the liver and cause scarring over time, although treatment can reduce the risk of the condition leading to liver cancer.\nPrimary biliary cirrhosis&nbsp;is a rare and poorly understood liver condition.\nOne of the main functions of the liver is to create a&nbsp;fluid called bile, used by the body to help break down fat. The bile is transported to the digestive system via a series of tubes called bile ducts.\nFor reasons that are unclear, in cases of primary biliary cirrhosis, the bile ducts gradually become&nbsp;damaged. This eventually leads to a build-up of bile inside the liver, which damages the liver and causes cirrhosis.\nFor many people, the first stage of diagnosing liver cancer is a consultation with a GP, although people at risk are usually tested regularly for the condition.\nIf you visit your GP, they will ask about your symptoms,&nbsp;when they started, and when they are noticeable. They will also examine you.\nIf they feel&nbsp;you need further tests, they will refer you to a hospital specialist.&nbsp;\nIf you are in a high-risk group for developing liver cancer, regular screening&nbsp;– known as surveillance&nbsp;– is often recommended. This is because the earlier the cancer is diagnosed, the greater the chance there is of curing it.\nSurveillance is usually carried out every 6 months and&nbsp;often involves:\n- ultrasound scans&nbsp;– high-frequency sound waves are used to create an image of your liver, which can highlight any abnormalities\n- blood tests&nbsp;–&nbsp;your blood is tested for a protein called&nbsp;alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), which is&nbsp;found in some people with liver cancer\nSurveillance is usually recommended if you have cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), although there are other factors that can also affect your risk of liver&nbsp;cancer.\nThe potential benefits of surveillance should&nbsp;be discussed with you before&nbsp;you enter&nbsp;any screening programme.\nThe tests above can also be used to look for liver cancer in people who are not being routinely screened.\nIf these initial&nbsp;tests suggest there is a chance you could have liver cancer, one or multiple tests will usually be recommended to confirm the diagnosis.\nThe further tests include:\n- computerised tomography (CT) scans –&nbsp;a series of X-rays of your liver are&nbsp;taken to give&nbsp;a more detailed three-dimensional image\n- magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans&nbsp;– uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to build up a picture of the inside of your liver\n- biopsy&nbsp;–&nbsp;a needle is inserted into your abdomen (tummy)&nbsp;to remove a small sample of liver tissue, which is then tested in a laboratory for cancerous cells\n- laparoscopy&nbsp;– a small incision is made in your abdomen under general anaesthetic (where you are asleep) and a flexible camera called an endoscope is used to examine your liver\nAfter&nbsp;these tests have been carried out, it will usually be possible to confirm a diagnosis of liver cancer and determine the condition&#8217;s stage.\nStaging is a term used to describe how far a particular cancer has spread. There are a number of different systems used to stage liver cancer.\nMany liver cancer specialists use combination staging systems that include features of both the cancer and the underlying liver function to stage a person&#8217;s condition.\nThis is because the length of time a person lives and how well they&nbsp;tolerate potential treatments will be determined not only by how advanced their cancer is, but also by their level of health and how good their underlying liver function is.\nOne combination system for staging liver cancer is known as the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system. The BCLC staging system consists of 5 stages. These are:\n- stage 0 –&nbsp;the tumour is less than 2cm (20mm) in diameter and the person is very well and has normal liver function\n- stage A –&nbsp;a single tumour has grown but is less than 5cm (50mm) in diameter, or there are 3 or fewer smaller tumours&nbsp;less than 3cm (30mm) in diameter and the person is very well with normal liver function\n- stage B – there are multiple tumours in the liver, but the person is well and their liver function is unaffected\n- stage C –&nbsp;any of the above circumstances, but the person is not so well and their liver function is not so good, or where the cancer has started to spread into the main blood vessel of the liver, nearby lymph nodes or other parts of the body\n- stage D –&nbsp;where the liver has lost most of its functioning abilities and the person begins to have symptoms of end-stage liver disease, such as a build-up of fluid inside their abdomen\nThe treatment for liver cancer depends on the stage of the condition. Treatment can include surgery and medication.\nMost hospitals use multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) to treat liver cancer. These are teams of specialists that work together to make decisions about the best way to proceed with your treatment.\nDeciding which treatment is best for you can often be confusing. Your cancer team will recommend what they think is the best treatment option, but the final decision will be yours.\nYour recommended treatment plan will depend on the stage your liver cancer is at.\nIf your cancer is at stage A when diagnosed, a complete cure may be possible. The 3 main ways this can be achieved are:\n- removing the affected section of liver – known as a resection\n- having a liver transplant – an operation to remove the liver and replace it with a healthy one\n- using heat to kill cancerous cells – known as microwave or radiofrequency ablation (RFA)\nIf your cancer is at stage B or C, a cure is not usually possible. However, chemotherapy can slow the progression of the cancer, relieve symptoms, and prolong life for months or, in some cases, years. There is also a medication called sorafenib that&nbsp;can help prolong life.\nIf your cancer is at stage D when diagnosed, it is usually too late to slow down the spread of the cancer. Instead, treatment focuses on relieving&nbsp;any&nbsp;symptoms of pain and discomfort you may have.\nIf damage to your liver is minimal and the cancer is contained in a small part of your liver, it may be possible to remove the cancerous cells during surgery. This procedure is known as surgical resection.\nAs the liver can regenerate itself, it may be possible to remove a large section of it without seriously affecting your health. However, in the majority of people with liver cancer, their liver&#8217;s regenerative ability may be significantly impaired and resection may be unsafe.\nWhether or not a resection can be performed is often determined by assessing the severity of your cirrhosis (scarring of the liver).\nIf a liver resection is recommended, it will be carried out under a general anaesthetic, which means you will be asleep during the procedure and won&#8217;t feel any pain as it is carried out.\nMost people are well enough to leave hospital within a week or two of having surgery. However, depending on how much of your liver was removed, it may take several months for you to fully recover.\nLiver resection is a complicated surgery and can have a considerable impact on your body. There is a significant risk of complications occurring during and after surgery.\nPossible complications of liver resection include:\n- infection at the site of the surgery\n- bleeding after the surgery\n- blood clots that develop in your legs – the medical term for this is deep vein thrombosis (DVT)\n- bile leaking from the liver – further surgery may be required to stop the leak\n- jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes)\n- liver failure (where your liver is no longer able to function properly)\nLiver resection can also sometimes cause fatal complications, such as a heart attack.&nbsp;\nA liver transplant involves removing a cancerous liver and replacing it with a healthy&nbsp;liver from a donor.\nThis is a major operation and there is a risk of potentially life-threatening complications.&nbsp;\nA liver transplant may be suitable for you if you:\n- only have a single tumour less than 5cm (50mm) in diameter\n- have 3 or fewer small tumours, each less than 3cm (30mm)\n- have responded exceptionally well to other treatments, with no evidence of tumour growth for 6 months\nIf you have multiple tumours or a tumour larger than 5cm, the risk of the cancer returning is usually so high that a liver transplant will be of no benefit.\nIf you are suitable for a liver transplant, you will normally need to be placed on a waiting list until a donor liver becomes available. The average waiting time for a liver transplant is 142 days for adults.\nIn some cases, a small part of the liver of a living relative can be used. This is known as a living donor liver transplant.\nThe advantage of using a living donor liver transplant is that the person receiving the transplant can plan the procedure with their medical team and relative, and will not usually have to wait very long.\nRead more about liver transplants.\nMicrowave or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) may be recommended as an alternative to surgery to treat liver cancer at an early stage, ideally when the tumour or tumours are smaller than 5cm (50mm) in diameter.\nThey can also be used to treat tumours larger than this, but the treatment may need to be repeated in such cases.\nThese treatments involve heating the tumours with microwaves or radio waves produced by small, needle-like electrodes. This heat kills the cancer cells and causes the tumours to shrink.\nSimilar procedures using lasers or freezing can also achieve the same result.\nThere are 3 main ways microwave ablation or RFA can be carried out:\n- where the needles are passed through the skin (percutaneously)\n- where the needles are inserted through small incisions in your abdomen&nbsp;– &#8216;keyhole&#8217; surgery (laparoscopy)\n- where the needles are inserted through a single large incision made in your abdomen&nbsp;– &#8216;open&#8217; surgery\nContinuous ultrasound or computerised tomography (CT) scans are used to make sure the needles are guided into the correct position.\nMicrowave ablation or RFA can be carried out under general anaesthetic or&nbsp;local anaesthetic (where you are awake but the area being treated is numbed), depending on the technique used and the size of the area being treated.\nHow long it takes to carry out the treatment depends on the size and number of tumours being treated, but it usually takes between 1 and 3 hours in total. Most people need to stay overnight in hospital.\nYou may experience some minor discomfort and&nbsp;flu-like symptoms, such as chills and muscle pains, for a few days after the procedure.\nThe risk of complications occurring with microwave ablation or RFA is low, but possible problems can include bleeding, infection, minor burns and damage to nearby organs.\nChemotherapy&nbsp;uses powerful cancer-killing medications to slow the spread of liver cancer.\nA type of chemotherapy called transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) is usually recommended to treat cases of stage B and C liver cancer. In these cases, the treatment can prolong life, but cannot cure the cancer.\nTACE may also be used to help prevent cancer spreading out of the liver in people waiting for a liver transplant.\nIt&nbsp;is not recommended for stage D liver cancer because it can make the symptoms of liver disease worse.\nDuring TACE a fine tube called a catheter is inserted&nbsp;into the main blood vessel in your groin (femoral artery) and passed along the artery&nbsp;to the main blood vessel that carries blood to the liver (hepatic artery).\nChemotherapy medication is injected directly into the liver through the catheter and either a gel or small plastic beads are injected into the blood vessels supplying the tumours to help slow down the speed they grow.\nTACE usually takes one to 2 hours to complete. After the procedure, you will stay in hospital overnight before returning home.\nThis procedure can be completed several times if necessary.\nInjecting chemotherapy medications directly into the liver, rather than into the blood, has the advantage of avoiding the wide range of side effects associated with conventional chemotherapy, such as hair loss and tiredness.\nHowever, the procedure is not free of side effects and complications. The most common side effect is post-chemoembolisation syndrome, which can cause abdominal (tummy) pain and a high temperature (fever), as well as making you vomit or feel sick.\nThese symptoms may last for a few weeks after a TACE session.\nRead more about chemotherapy.\nIf you only have a few small tumours, alcohol (ethanol) injections may be used as a treatment.&nbsp;A needle passes through the skin to inject alcohol into the cancerous cells. This dehydrates the cells and stops their blood supply.\nIn most cases, this is carried out under a local anaesthetic, meaning you will be awake, but the affected area is numbed so you won&#8217;t feel any pain.\nSorafenib is a medication given in tablet form that can disrupt the blood supply to liver tumours and slow down their growth.\nIt is sometimes used as a treatment for advanced cases of liver cancer, although it is not routinely available on the NHS because the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has said the cost of the medication is high for the limited benefit it offers.\nWhether or not you are eligible for sorafenib will be decided by your medical team, and will depend on the likelihood of whether&nbsp;you will significantly benefit from the medication.\nFor more information, see the NICE guidelines on sorafenib for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.\nTreatment for advanced liver cancer focuses on relieving symptoms such as pain and discomfort, rather than attempting to slow down the progression of the cancer.\nSome people with advanced liver cancer require strong painkillers, such as codeine or possibly morphine. Nausea and constipation are common side effects of these types of painkillers, so you may also be given an anti-sickness tablet and a laxative.\nRead more about end of life care."

        "description": "There are more than 100 different types of liver disease, which together affect at least 2 million people in the UK.\nThe liver is the second largest organ in the body. It works hard, performing hundreds of complex functions, including:\n- fighting infections and illness\n- removing toxins (poisons), such as alcohol,&nbsp;from the body\n- controlling&nbsp;cholesterol levels\n- helping blood to clot (thicken)\n- releasing bile, a liquid that breaks down fats and aids digestion\nLiver disease doesn&#8217;t usually cause any obvious signs or symptoms until it&#8217;s fairly advanced and the liver is damaged.\nAt this stage, possible symptoms can include loss of appetite, weight loss and jaundice.\nListed on this page are some specific types of liver disease. The links provide more detailed information about each type:\n- alcohol-related liver disease – where the liver is damaged after years of alcohol misuse, this can lead to cirrhosis (scarring of the liver)\n- Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease – a build-up of fat within liver cells, usually seen in overweight people or those who are obese\n- hepatitis – which is inflammation (swelling) of the liver caused by a viral infection or exposure to harmful substances such as alcohol\n- haemochromatosis – an inherited disorder where there&#8217;s a gradual build-up of iron in the body, usually around the liver\n- primary biliary cirrhosis – a rare, long-term type of liver disease that damages the bile ducts in the liver\nAll types of liver disease can cause cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), not just alcohol-related liver disease.\nIn the UK, liver disease is on the increase. The 3 main causes of liver disease are:\n- obesity&nbsp;\n- undiagnosed hepatitis infection\n- alcohol misuse&nbsp;\nThese causes of liver disease are all preventable."

        "disease": "Liver tumours",
        "description": "Liver tumours can be non-cancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant).&nbsp;Boys are affected more commonly than girls.\nThere are 2 main types of primary liver cancer.\nThis usually occurs in children under 5 years old.&nbsp;\nThis is rarer and usually occurs in older children.&nbsp;\nMore children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.\nIt’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer. At times it can feel overwhelming but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.\nUnderstanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. Your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information and if you have any questions it’s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.\nThe liver is the largest organ in the body. It’s surrounded by a fibrous capsule and is divided into sections called lobes. It lies across the upper part of the abdomen and is larger on the right-hand side of the body than on the left. It’s surrounded, and protected from injury, by the lower ribs.\nThe liver is an extremely important organ that has many functions. One of these functions is to produce proteins that circulate in the blood. Some of the proteins help the blood to clot and prevent excessive bleeding. Others are essential for maintaining the balance of fluid in the body. The liver also destroys harmful substances. It breaks down waste products not used by the body so that they can be passed out in the urine or stools (bowel motions).\nThe liver is responsible for breaking down food containing carbohydrates (sugars) and fats, so they can be used by the body for energy. It stores substances such as glucose and vitamins so that they can be used by the body when needed.\nThe liver also produces bile, a substance that breaks down the fats in food so that they can be absorbed from the bowel (intestine).\nThe liver is connected to the small intestine (duodenum) by a tube called the bile duct. This duct takes the bile produced by the liver to the intestine.\nThe liver has an amazing ability to repair itself. It can function normally even if only a small part of it is working.\nThe cause of most primary liver tumours in the western world is unknown. However, in other parts of the world, hepatocellular cancer (HCC) is commonly related to the presence of liver infection. This happens in countries where mothers commonly have hepatitis B and vaccination is not readily available at birth for their children.\nChildren who are infected with hepatitis B have a higher risk of developing HCC in late childhood than uninfected children.\nThe most common symptom is a lump or swelling in the abdomen, which can be painful. Other possible symptoms include weight loss, a loss of appetite, feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting).\nA variety of tests and investigations may be needed to diagnose a liver tumour.\nAn&nbsp;ultrasound scan&nbsp;and&nbsp;X-rays&nbsp;will be taken, which can show if there is a tumour in the liver. Further tests, including&nbsp;CT (computerised tomography) scans&nbsp;or&nbsp;MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans, will be done to find out the extent of the disease, both inside and outside the liver.&nbsp;Blood tests&nbsp;will also be carried out.\nMost hepatoblastomas and hepatocellular carcinomas produce a protein that is released into the bloodstream. This protein is known as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). It’s possible to measure levels of AFP in the blood, which can be a useful indicator of whether the liver tumour is responding to treatment or whether it may have come back after treatment. AFP is also known as a tumour marker.\nAny tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you.\nTo assess the extent of the cancer, a grouping system called PRETEXT (pre-treatment extent of disease) is used. It uses an MRI scan to measure the amount of cancer in the liver at diagnosis. It’s also used to help establish the best treatment for each child.\nThis grouping system is unique to liver tumours and is increasingly used all over the world.\nThis grouping process is essential because liver tumours need to be removed surgically. Grouping divides the liver into four surgical areas (sectors) and gives an indication of the kind of surgery that is needed to remove the tumour. Grouping also helps doctors decide whether a liver transplant surgeon needs to be involved from the start or not.\n- PRETEXT 1&nbsp;– 1&nbsp;liver sector is affected and the tumour can be removed by straightforward surgery\n- PRETEXT 2 – 2&nbsp;adjoining sectors are affected and the tumour can be removed with more extensive surgery\n- PRETEXT 3 – 2&nbsp;or 3 sectors are affected with no 2 adjoining sectors free of disease, and the tumour can be removed with major surgery\n- PRETEXT 4 – all 4 sectors of the liver are affected, and the tumour cannot be removed without replacing the liver with a donor liver transplant\nDoctors also look at the extent of the spread of cancer beyond the liver.\nSometimes the tumour gets into the blood vessels that are entering or leaving the liver. This may affect the type of surgery needed to remove the tumour.\nSometimes the tumour spreads outside the liver and into the abdomen (tummy). The tumour cannot be removed completely.\nIf the tumour spreads outside the liver through the bloodstream (metastatic disease), it usually goes to the lungs. About 1 in 5 children are found to have affected lungs when they are diagnosed. Doctors use X-rays and CT or MRI scans to assess whether the lungs are affected.\nThe diagnosis is made by taking a sample of cells from the tumour (biopsy). This is done under a general anaesthetic. Once the diagnosis and staging have been confirmed, plans for treatment will be made.\nFor hepatoblastoma, the type of treatment will depend on the PRETEXT staging and whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic disease).\nPRETEXT 1, 2 and 3 tumours are called ‘standard risk’. PRETEXT 4 is called ‘high risk’ and includes tumours that have spread to other parts of the body.\nTreatment is broadly similar for all PRETEXT stages. Chemotherapy (anti-cancer drugs) is given first. The aim of chemotherapy is to shrink the tumour in the liver and hopefully get rid of any metastatic tumours. Surgery to remove any of the&nbsp;remaining tumour will take place after a few weeks of chemotherapy. Further chemotherapy is usually given after surgery. Your child’s doctor will give you more detailed information about the chemotherapy drugs and their side effects.\nFor hepatocellular carcinoma, treatment is a little different.\nThe role of chemotherapy is less certain and surgery is the main treatment. Doctors usually recommend removing the tumour (if it’s small enough) at diagnosis. Chemotherapy may be given afterwards. However in many situations the tumour is too large to remove at first, and so chemotherapy is given to shrink the tumour so that surgery can be done later.\nHepatocellular tumours don’t always respond to chemotherapy as well as hepatoblastomas. For this reason, other treatments, such as chemoembolisation and targeted treatments, may be used.\nThis refers to the giving of drugs directly into the artery going into the liver. Very occasionally, this may be used for hepatocellular cancer.\nTargeted drugs are a group of treatments that work in a different way to conventional chemotherapy. Some drugs may cause cancer cells to die directly. Others act to cut off the blood supply to the tumour cells (antiangiogenesis drugs). Some drugs, called multi-targeted agents, work in both ways.\nResearch is looking into how useful targeted treatments are on their own and in combination with chemotherapy. Your child’s doctor may talk to you more about this research.\nAll children, if they are able to, will have surgery following chemotherapy. If there’s cancer in the lungs, which hasn’t completely disappeared with the chemotherapy, the lungs will be operated on first. If the liver tumour can be surgically removed, the operation to do so will follow, usually a week or two later.\nIf the tumour involves all 4 sectors of the liver (PRETEXT 4), a liver transplant will be necessary. This is recommended for hepatoblastoma but only in particular circumstances for hepatocellular carcinoma. In a transplant, the whole liver is removed and replaced with a liver from another person.\nThis will be discussed with you from the beginning, and you will be given the opportunity to think about donating half of your liver, or for your child to have a liver from a donor. The transplant team will be there to answer all of your questions. A liver transplant is only possible if all the cancer outside the liver has gone.\nTreatment often causes side effects, and your child’s doctor will discuss these with you before treatment starts. Side effects can include:\n- feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting)\n- hair loss\n- an increased risk of infection\n- bruising and bleeding\n- tiredness\n- diarrhoea\nThe chemotherapy used to treat liver cancer can cause late side effects. These may include hearing problems, kidney problems and possibly heart problems. There will be a slightly increased risk of your child developing another type of cancer later in life. Most children will develop some late effects and need to have some follow-up tests. Your child’s doctor or nurse will tell you more about any possible late side effects.\nIf the cancer comes back after initial treatment, this is known as a recurrence. It can come back in the liver or in other parts of the body. If the cancer comes back, often (before anything is seen on scans) the levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in the child’s blood will start to rise again and reaches levels of over 100. Small rises in AFP can occur in the weeks after surgery, as the liver regenerates as much as it can.\nMany children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. Specialist doctors carry out trials for children’s cancer. If appropriate, your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial and will answer any questions you have. Written information is often provided to help explain things.\nTaking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide if it’s right for your child.\nSometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child’s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The&nbsp;Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group&nbsp;(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.\nWhen the treatment ends, your child will have regular blood tests to measure the level of AFP in the blood (if appropriate), as well as scans and chest X-rays. More than three quarters of children with hepatoblastoma are cured, and for children with small tumours that are confined to the liver, the outlook is even better. The outcome for hepatocellular carcinoma is not quite as good. The staff at the hospital can give you information about the likely outcome for your child.\nAs a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time.\nYour child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer.\nFurther information and advice if your child has cancer"

        "description": "Loss of libido (sex drive) is a common problem affecting up to 1 in 5 men – and even more women – at some point in their life.\nIt&#8217;s often linked to professional and personal stress, or&nbsp;important life-changing events such as pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding.\nHowever, an unexpected loss of libido&nbsp;–&nbsp;especially when it lasts for a long time or keeps returning&nbsp;–&nbsp;can also indicate an underlying personal, medical or lifestyle problem,&nbsp;which can be upsetting to both partners in a relationship.\nIf you&#8217;re concerned about your libido, especially if your diminished sex drive distresses you or affects your relationship, make an appointment to see your GP to discuss any underlying causes and possible medical or psychological treatments.\nDoctors at your nearest family planning clinic, Integrated Sexual Health clinic, or Contraceptive and Sexual Health (CASH) clinic may also be able to help.\nIn the meantime, you may find the following information useful. It explains some of the most common reasons for loss of libido.\nThe first thing you should consider is whether you&#8217;re happy in your relationship. Do you have any doubts or worries that may be the real reason for your loss of sexual desire?\nIf you&#8217;ve been in a relationship for a long time, you may have become overfamiliar with your partner and feel a degree of erotic dissatisfaction. This is quite common and can have a negative effect on your sex drive.\nRelationship problems are among the most common causes of loss of libido. For help and advice, you&nbsp;may find it useful to contact the relationship support charity Relationships Scotland.\nAnother thing to consider is whether the problem is a performance issue that makes sex difficult or unfulfilling. For example, many men experience ejaculation problems or erectile dysfunction, and women can experience painful sex or vaginismus (when the muscles around the vagina tighten involuntarily before penetration). See your GP if these problems are an issue, as they&#8217;re often treatable.\nYour GP may feel you will benefit from psychosexual counselling. This is a form of relationship therapy where you and your partner can discuss any sexual or emotional issues that may be contributing to your loss of libido.&nbsp;\nStress, anxiety and exhaustion can be all-consuming and have a major impact on your happiness. If you feel you&#8217;re constantly tired, stressed or anxious, you may need to make some lifestyle changes or speak to your GP for advice.\nFor more information and advice read about&nbsp;beating stress at work&nbsp;and&nbsp;10 stress busters\nDepression&nbsp;is very different from simply feeling unhappy, miserable or fed up for a short while. It&#8217;s a serious illness where you may have feelings of extreme sadness that can last for a long time. These feelings are severe enough to interfere with your daily life, including your sex life.\nYou&#8217;re probably depressed if you&#8217;re feeling low or hopeless, or you&#8217;ve lost interest or pleasure in doing things you used to enjoy. In this case it&#8217;s really important to see your GP. They may feel you&#8217;ll benefit from antidepressants.\nHowever, low sex drive can also be a side effect of many antidepressants. Speak to your GP if you&#8217;re already taking antidepressants and think they may be causing your problems, as you may be able to switch to a different medication.\nDrinking excess amounts of alcohol can reduce your sex drive, so it&#8217;s a good idea to moderate your intake to no more than three to four units a day if you&#8217;re a man, and no more than two to three units a day if you&#8217;re a woman.\nRead more about alcohol misuse and find out how to get support for a drinking problem.\nDrug misuse is also linked to a loss of sex drive. Read more about drugs for information and advice.\nMany people lose some interest in sex as they get older, mainly as a result of falling levels of sex hormones, age-related health problems, or the side effects of medication.\nOlder men especially can develop low testosterone levels, which can cause fatigue, depression and a reduced sex drive.\nSpeak to your GP if you&#8217;re concerned about this. They may carry out a blood test to check your testosterone level and can tell you about treatments if your level is low.\nAs women start to approach the menopause, levels of the female hormone oestrogen begin to fall, which can affect libido. Women can also suffer from low testosterone levels, especially after a hysterectomy. Testosterone is another hormone&nbsp;that can affect sex drive.\nSpeak to your GP if you&#8217;re concerned the menopause may be having an effect on your libido. They may be able to offer you a trial of hormone replacement therapy&nbsp;(HRT) if it&#8217;s suitable for you.\nLess commonly, low libido may be caused by an underactive thyroid. This is where your thyroid gland (located in the neck) doesn&#8217;t produce enough hormones. Common signs of an underactive thyroid are tiredness, weight gain and feeling depressed.\nAn underactive thyroid is easily treated by taking hormone tablets to replace the hormones your thyroid isn&#8217;t making. Learn more about treating underactive thyroid.\nA hormonal problem called hyperprolactinaemia can also have a negative effect on your sex drive. This is where you have a raised level of a substance called prolactin in your blood.\nSome women have reported a decreased sex drive while using&nbsp;some types of hormonal&nbsp;contraception, such as:\n- combined contraception, including the&nbsp;combined pill, vaginal ring,&nbsp;or contraceptive patch\n- the progestogen-only pill\n- the contraceptive implant\n- the Depo-Provera injection\nHowever, side effects of these contraceptives&nbsp;tend to&nbsp;improve within a few months and they&#8217;re generally well tolerated.\nSpeak to your GP or&nbsp;local contraceptive (or family planning) clinic if you&#8217;re worried&nbsp;your contraception&nbsp;is causing a loss of libido. They may suggest trying an alternative method.\nRead more about choosing a method of contraception\nLong-term (chronic) medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity can also have a negative effect on your libido.\nCertain medications can sometimes reduce libido, such as:\n- medication for high blood pressure, including diuretics\n- medications for depression, including SSRI antidepressants\n- medications for seizures (fits)\n- medications commonly used to treat&nbsp;psychosis (a mental condition where a person can&#8217;t distinguish between reality and their imagination), such as haloperidol, as well as many other conditions\n- medicines such as cimetidine, finasteride and cyproterone, which block the effects or reduce the production of testosterone\nSee your GP if you&#8217;re worried that medication you&#8217;re taking is responsible for your reduced sex drive. They can review your medication and switch your prescription to something less likely to affect your libido if necessary."

        "disease": "Low blood pressure",
        "description": "Blood pressure is the pressure of blood in the arteries. The arteries are vessels that carry blood from the heart around the body.\nThere needs to be a certain level of pressure in the arteries to move blood around the body. If your blood pressure is low, you may experience some symptoms.\nLow blood pressure is when your blood pressure is less than 90/60mmHg. This is also known as hypotension.\nMost people with low blood pressure won&#8217;t have any symptoms, but some may experience:\n- light-headedness or dizziness\n- fainting\n- blurred vision\n- confusion\n- feeling sick\n- general weakness\nYou should speak to your healthcare professional if you have any of these symptoms.\nTo check your blood pressure you can:\n- ask your pharmacist to do it\n- ask your GP or practice nurse to do it\n- measure it at home using a home blood pressure monitor\nWatch this video to learn how to measure your blood pressure at home.\nThere are some things that can contribute to low blood pressure, including:\n- the time of day – blood pressure falls overnight\n- your age – low blood pressure is more likely as you get older\n- feeling relaxed\n- rest\n- cold temperatures\n- being fit and healthy\nLow blood pressure can also be caused by:\n- pregnancy\n- some medical conditions, like diabetes\n- some medications\n- some heart conditions\n- dehydration\nSome people get symptoms of low blood pressure after a sudden movement like standing up. This is known as postural orthostatic hypotension.\nSymptoms of low blood pressure can also happen after eating. This is known as postprandial hypotension.\nIf you&#8217;ve got symptoms of low blood pressure, your healthcare professional will try to find out why. This means they can help you to manage the cause of your low blood pressure.\nThey may:\n- consider making changes to any medicines that may be contributing to your low blood pressure\n- suggest making small lifestyle changes\n- suggest making dietary changes, including looking at your salt intake\nYou could also try:\n- standing up slowly, particularly first thing in the morning\n- wearing support stockings to improve circulation and increase blood pressure\n- eating small frequent meals, rather than large ones\n- lying or sitting down after eating\n- avoiding sitting or standing for long periods\n- avoiding changing your posture suddenly\n- stretching before standing up to increase your heart rate and blood flow\n- drinking more water – check with your doctor how much fluid you can drink if you&#8217;re on a daily fluid restriction due to a heart condition"

        "disease": "Lung cancer",
        "description": "Lung cancer is one of the most common and serious types of cancer.&nbsp;\nThere are usually no signs or symptoms in the early stages of lung cancer, but many people with the condition eventually develop symptoms including:\n- a persistent cough\n- coughing up blood\n- persistent breathlessness\n- unexplained tiredness and weight loss\n- an ache or pain when breathing or coughing\nYou should speak to your GP if you have these symptoms.\nRead more about the symptoms of lung cancer\nCancer that begins in the lungs is called primary lung cancer. Cancer that spreads from the lungs to another place in the body is known as secondary lung cancer. This&nbsp;page is about&nbsp;primary lung cancer.\nThere are 2 main types of primary lung cancer.&nbsp;These are classified by the type of cells in which the cancer starts. They are:\n- non-small-cell lung cancer – the most common type, accounting for more than 80% of cases; can be either&nbsp;squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma or large-cell carcinoma\n- small-cell lung cancer –&nbsp;a less common type that&nbsp;usually spreads&nbsp;faster than non-small-cell lung cancer\nThe type of lung cancer you have determines which treatments are recommended.\nRead more about&nbsp;diagnosing lung cancer\nLung cancer mainly affects older people.&nbsp;It&#8217;s&nbsp;rare in people younger than 40, and the rates of lung cancer rise sharply with age. Lung cancer is most commonly&nbsp;diagnosed in people aged 70&nbsp;to 74.\nAlthough people who have never smoked can develop lung cancer, smoking is the main cause (accounting for over 85% of cases). This is because smoking involves regularly inhaling a number of different toxic substances.\nRead more about:\n- causes of lung cancer\n- preventing lung cancer\nTreatment depends on the type of cancer, how far it&#8217;s spread and how good your general health is.\nIf the condition is diagnosed early and the cancerous cells are confined to a small area, surgery to remove the affected area of lung is usually recommended.\nIf surgery is unsuitable due to your general health,&nbsp;radiotherapy&nbsp;to destroy the cancerous cells may be recommended instead.\nIf the cancer has spread too far for surgery or radiotherapy to be effective,&nbsp;chemotherapy&nbsp;is usually used.\nRead more about treating lung cancer\nSymptoms of lung cancer develop as the condition progresses and there are usually no signs or symptoms in the early stages.\nThe main symptoms of lung cancer are:\n- a&nbsp;cough that doesn’t go away after 2 or 3 weeks\n- a long-standing cough that&nbsp;gets worse\n- persistent chest infections\n- coughing up blood\n- an ache or pain when breathing or coughing\n- persistent breathlessness\n- persistent tiredness or lack of energy\n- loss of appetite or unexplained weight loss\nLess common symptoms of lung cancer include:\n- changes in the appearance of your fingers, such as becoming more curved or their ends becoming larger (this is known as finger clubbing)\n- a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above&nbsp;\n- difficulty swallowing&nbsp;or pain when swallowing\n- wheezing\n- a hoarse voice&nbsp;\n- swelling of your face or neck\n- persistent chest or shoulder pain\nIf you have any of these, you should speak to your GP.\nRead further information:\n- Cancer Research UK: Symptoms of lung cancer\n- Macmillan Cancer Support: Signs and Symptoms of lung cancer&nbsp;\nMost cases of lung cancer are caused by smoking, although people who have never smoked can also develop the condition.\nSmoking cigarettes is the single biggest risk factor for lung cancer.&nbsp;It&#8217;s responsible for more than 85% of all cases.\nTobacco smoke contains more than 60 different toxic substances, which can&nbsp;lead to&nbsp;the development of cancer. These substances are known to be carcinogenic (cancer-producing).\nIf you smoke more than 25 cigarettes a day, you are 25 times more likely to get lung cancer than a non-smoker.\nWhile smoking cigarettes is the biggest risk factor, using other types of tobacco products can also increase your risk of developing lung cancer and other types of cancer, such as oesophageal cancer and mouth cancer. These products include:\n- cigars\n- pipe tobacco\n- snuff (a powdered form of tobacco)\n- chewing tobacco\nSmoking cannabis has also been linked to an increased risk of lung cancer. Most cannabis smokers mix their cannabis with tobacco.&nbsp;While they tend to smoke less than tobacco smokers, they usually inhale more deeply and hold the smoke in their lungs for longer.\nIt&#8217;s been&nbsp;estimated that smoking 4 joints (homemade cigarettes mixed with cannabis) may be as damaging to the lungs as smoking 20 cigarettes.\nEven smoking cannabis without mixing it with tobacco is potentially dangerous. This is because cannabis also contains substances that can cause cancer.\nIf you don&#8217;t smoke, frequent exposure to other people’s tobacco smoke (passive smoking) can increase your risk of developing lung cancer.\nFor example, research has found that non-smoking women who share their house with a smoking partner are 25% more likely to develop lung cancer than non-smoking women who live with a non-smoking partner.\nRadon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that&nbsp;comes from tiny amounts of uranium present in all rocks and soils. It can sometimes be found in buildings.\nIf radon is breathed in, it can damage your lungs, particularly if you&#8217;re a smoker.&nbsp;\nExposure to certain chemicals and substances used in several occupations and industries has been linked to a slightly higher risk of developing lung cancer. These chemicals and substances include:\n- arsenic\n- asbestos\n- beryllium\n- cadmium\n- coal and coke fumes\n- silica\n- nickel\nRead more information about&nbsp;asbestosis and silicosis.\nResearch&nbsp;also suggests that being exposed to large amounts of diesel fumes for many years may increase your risk of developing lung cancer by up to 50%. One study has shown that your risk of developing lung cancer increases by about a third if you live in an area with high levels of nitrogen oxide gases (mostly produced by cars and other vehicles).\nRead further information about the&nbsp;causes and risk factors for lung cancer\nSpeak to your GP if you have symptoms of lung cancer, such as breathlessness or a persistent cough.\nYour GP will ask about your general health and what symptoms you&#8217;ve been experiencing. They may examine you and ask you to breathe into a device called a spirometer, which measures how much air you breathe in and out.\nYou may be asked to have a&nbsp;blood test to rule out some of the possible causes of your symptoms, such as a chest infection.\nIn 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of lung cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected lung cancer.\nA chest X-ray is usually the first test used to diagnose lung cancer. Most lung tumours show up on X-rays as a white-grey mass.\nHowever, chest X-rays can&#8217;t give a definitive diagnosis because they often can&#8217;t distinguish between cancer and other conditions, such as a lung abscess (a collection of pus that forms in the lungs).\nIf your chest X-ray suggests you may have lung cancer, you should be referred to a specialist (if you haven&#8217;t already) in chest conditions such as lung cancer. A specialist can carry out more tests to investigate whether you have lung cancer and, if you do,&nbsp;what type it is&nbsp;and how much it&#8217;s spread.\nA computerised tomography (CT) scan is usually carried out after a chest X-ray. A CT scan&nbsp;uses X-rays and a computer to create detailed images of the inside of your body.\nBefore having a CT scan, you&#8217;ll be given an injection of a contrast medium. This is a liquid containing a dye that makes the lungs show up more clearly on the scan. The scan is painless and takes 10 to 30 minutes to complete.\nA PET-CT scan (which stands for positron emission tomography-computerised tomography) may be carried out if the results of the CT scan show you have cancer at an early stage.\nThe PET-CT scan can show where there are active cancer cells. This can help with diagnosis and treatment.\nBefore having a PET-CT scan, you&#8217;ll be injected with a slightly radioactive material. You&#8217;ll be asked to lie down on a table, which slides into the PET scanner. The scan is painless and takes around 30 to 60 minutes.\nIf the CT scan shows there might be cancer in the central part of your chest, you&#8217;ll have a bronchoscopy. A bronchoscopy is a procedure&nbsp;that allows&nbsp;a doctor or nurse to&nbsp;remove a small sample of cells from inside your lungs.\nDuring a bronchoscopy, a thin tube called a bronchoscope is used to examine your lungs and take a sample of cells (biopsy). The bronchoscope is passed through your mouth or nose, down your throat and into the airways of your lungs.\nThe procedure may be uncomfortable, but you&#8217;ll be given a mild sedative beforehand to help you relax and a&nbsp;local anaesthetic to make your throat numb. The procedure is very quick and only takes a few minutes.\nIf you&#8217;re not able to have one of the biopsies described above, or you&#8217;ve had one and the results weren&#8217;t clear, you may be offered a different type of biopsy. This may be a type of surgical biopsy such as a thoracoscopy or a mediastinoscopy, or a biopsy carried out using a needle inserted through your skin.\nA percutaneous needle biopsy involves removing a sample from a suspected tumour to test it at a laboratory for cancerous cells.\nThe doctor carrying out the biopsy will use a CT scanner to guide a needle to the site of a suspected tumour through the skin. A local anaesthetic is used to numb the surrounding skin, and the needle is passed through your skin and into your lungs. The needle will then be used to remove a sample of tissue for testing.\nA thoracoscopy is a procedure that allows the doctor to examine a particular area of your chest and take tissue and fluid samples.\nYou&#8217;re likely to need a&nbsp;general anaesthetic before having a thoracoscopy. Two or three small cuts will be made in your chest to pass a tube (similar to a bronchoscope) into your chest. The doctor will use the tube to look inside your chest and take samples. The samples will then be sent away for tests.\nAfter a thoracoscopy, you may need to stay in hospital overnight while any further fluid in your lungs is drained out.\nA mediastinoscopy allows the doctor to examine the area between your lungs at the centre of your chest (mediastinum).\nFor this test, you&#8217;ll need to have a general anaesthetic and stay in hospital for a couple of days. The doctor will make a small cut at the bottom of your neck so they can pass a thin tube into your chest.\nThe tube has a camera at the end, which enables the doctor to see inside your chest. They&#8217;ll also be able to take samples of your cells and lymph nodes at the same time. The lymph nodes are tested because they&#8217;re usually the first place that lung cancer spreads to.\nOnce tests have been completed, it should be possible to work out what stage your cancer is, what this means&nbsp;for your treatment and whether it&#8217;s possible to&nbsp;completely cure the cancer.\nNon-small-cell lung cancer (the most common type)&nbsp;usually spreads more slowly than small-cell lung cancer and responds differently to treatment.\nThe cancer is contained within the lung and hasn&#8217;t spread to nearby lymph nodes. Stage 1 can also be divided into two sub-stages:\n- stage 1A – the tumour is less than 3cm in size (1.2 inches)&nbsp;\n- stage 1B – the tumour is 3-5cm (1.2-2 inches)\nStage 2 is divided into 2 sub-stages: 2A and 2B.\nIn stage 2A lung cancer, either:\n- the tumour is 5&nbsp;to 7cm&nbsp;\n- the tumour is less than 5cm&nbsp;and cancerous cells have spread to nearby lymph nodes\nIn stage 2B lung cancer, either:\n- the tumour is larger than 7cm&nbsp;\n- the tumour is 5&nbsp;to 7cm and cancerous cells have spread to nearby lymph nodes&nbsp;\n- the cancer hasn&#8217;t spread to lymph nodes, but has spread to surrounding&nbsp;muscles or tissue&nbsp;\n- the cancer has spread to one of the main airways (bronchus)&nbsp;\n- the cancer has caused the lung to collapse&nbsp;\n- there are multiple small tumours in the lung\nStage 3 is divided into 2 sub-stages: 3A and 3B.\nIn stage 3A lung cancer, the cancer has either spread to the lymph nodes in the middle of the chest or into the surrounding tissue. This can be:\n- the covering of the lung (the pleura)\n- the chest wall\n- the middle of the chest\n- other lymph nodes near the affected lung\nIn stage 3B lung cancer, the cancer has spread to either of the following:\n- lymph nodes on either side of the chest, above the collarbones\n- another important part of the body, such as the gullet (oesophagus), windpipe (trachea), heart or into a main blood vessel\nIn stage 4 lung cancer, the cancer has either spread to both lungs or to another part of the body (such as the bones, liver or brain), or the cancer has caused fluid-containing cancer cells to build up around your heart or lungs.\nSmall-cell lung cancer is less common than non-small-cell lung cancer. The cancerous cells responsible for the condition are smaller in size when examined under a microscope than the cells that cause non-small-cell lung cancer.\nSmall-cell lung cancer only&nbsp;has 2 possible stages:\n- limited disease – the cancer has not spread beyond the lung\n- extensive disease – the cancer has spread beyond the lung\nCancer Research UK has further information on types of lung cancer.\nTreatment for lung cancer is carried out by a team of specialists who will work together to provide the best possible treatment.\nThis team contains all the specialists required to make a proper diagnosis, to stage your cancer and to plan the best treatment. If you want to know more, ask your specialist about this.\nThe type of treatment you&#8217;ll receive for lung cancer depends on several factors, including:\n- the type of lung cancer you have (non-small-cell or small-cell cancer)\n- the size and position of the cancer\n- how far advanced your cancer is (the stage)\n- your overall health\nDeciding what treatment is best for you can be difficult. Your cancer team will make recommendations, but the final decision will be yours.\nThe main treatment options include surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Depending on your type of cancer and how advanced it is, you may receive a combination of these treatments.\nYour treatment plan depends on whether you have non-small-cell lung cancer or small-cell lung cancer.\nIf you have non-small-cell lung cancer that&#8217;s confined to one lung and you&#8217;re in good general health, you&#8217;ll probably have surgery to remove the cancerous cells. This may be followed by a course of chemotherapy to destroy any cancer cells that may have remained in the body.\nIf the cancer hasn&#8217;t spread too far but surgery isn&#8217;t possible (for example, if your general health means you have an increased risk of developing complications), radiotherapy to destroy the cancerous cells will usually be recommended. In some cases, this may be combined with chemotherapy (known as chemoradiotherapy).\nIf the cancer has spread too far for surgery or radiotherapy to be effective, chemotherapy is usually recommended. If the cancer starts to grow again after initial chemotherapy treatment, another course of treatment may be recommended.\nIn some cases, a treatment called biological or targeted therapy may be recommended as an alternative to chemotherapy, or after chemotherapy. Biological therapies are medications that can control or stop the growth of cancer cells.&nbsp;\nSmall-cell lung cancer is usually treated with chemotherapy, either on its own or in combination with radiotherapy. This can help to prolong life and relieve symptoms.\nSurgery isn&#8217;t usually used to treat this type of lung cancer. This is&nbsp;because the cancer has often already spread to other areas of the body by the time it&#8217;s diagnosed. However, if the cancer is found very early, surgery may be used. In these cases, chemotherapy or radiotherapy may be given after surgery to help reduce the risk of the cancer returning.\nThere are&nbsp;3&nbsp; types of lung cancer surgery:\n- lobectomy –&nbsp;where&nbsp;one&nbsp;or more large parts of the lung (called lobes) are removed – your doctors will suggest this operation if the cancer is just in 1 section of 1 lung\n- pneumonectomy – where the entire lung is removed – this is used when the cancer is located in the middle of the lung or has spread throughout the lung\n- wedge resection or segmentectomy – where a small piece of the lung is removed (this procedure is&nbsp;only suitable for a small number of patients, as it is only used if your doctors think your cancer is small and limited to one area of the lung – this is&nbsp;usually very early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer)\nPeople are naturally concerned that they won&#8217;t&nbsp;be able to breathe if some or all of a lung is removed, but it&#8217;s possible to breathe normally with 1 lung. However, if you have breathing problems before the operation, such as breathlessness, it&#8217;s likely that these symptoms will continue after surgery.\nBefore surgery can take place, you&#8217;ll need to have a number of tests to check your general state of health and your lung function. These may include:\n- an&nbsp;electrocardiogram (ECG) – electrodes are used to monitor the electrical activity of your heart\n- spirometry&nbsp;– you&#8217;ll breathe into a machine called a spirometer, which measures how much air your lungs can breathe in and out\nSurgery is usually performed by making a cut (incision)&nbsp;in your chest or side, and removing a section or all of the affected lung. Nearby lymph nodes may also be removed if it&#8217;s thought that the cancer may have spread to them.\nIn some cases, an alternative to this approach, called video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), may be suitable. VATS is a type of keyhole surgery, where small incisions are made in the chest. A small fibre-optic camera is inserted into one of the incisions, so the surgeon can see images of the inside of your chest&nbsp;on a monitor.\nYou&#8217;ll probably be&nbsp;able to go home 5 to 10 days after your operation. However, it can take many weeks to recover fully from a lung operation.\nAfter your operation, you&#8217;ll be encouraged to start moving about as soon as possible. Even if you have to stay in bed, you&#8217;ll need to keep doing regular leg movements to help your circulation and prevent blood clots from forming. A physiotherapist will show you breathing exercises to help prevent complications.\nWhen you go home, you&#8217;ll need to exercise gently to build up your strength and fitness. Walking and swimming are good forms of exercise that are suitable for most people after treatment for lung cancer. Talk to your care team about which types of exercise are suitable for you.\nAs with all surgery, lung surgery carries a risk of complications. These are estimated to occur in 1 out in 5 cases. These complications can usually be treated using medication or additional surgery, which may mean you need to stay in hospital for longer.\nComplications of lung surgery can include:\n- inflammation or infection of the lung (pneumonia)&nbsp;\n- excessive bleeding&nbsp;\n- a blood clot in the leg (deep vein thrombosis), which could potentially travel up to the lung (pulmonary embolism)\nRadiotherapy is a type of treatment that uses pulses of radiation to destroy cancer cells. There are a number of ways it can be used to treat people with lung cancer.\nAn intensive course of radiotherapy, known as radical radiotherapy, can be used to try to cure non-small-cell lung cancer if the person isn&#8217;t healthy enough for surgery. For very small tumours, a special type of radiotherapy called stereotactic radiotherapy may be used instead of surgery.\nRadiotherapy can also be used to control the symptoms and slow the spread of cancer when a cure isn&#8217;t possible (this is known as palliative radiotherapy).\nA type of radiotherapy known as prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is also sometimes used during the treatment of small-cell lung cancer. PCI involves treating the whole brain with a low dose of radiation. It&#8217;s used as a preventative measure because there&#8217;s a risk that small-cell lung cancer will spread to your brain.\nThe 3 main&nbsp;ways that radiotherapy can be given are described below:\n- conventional external beam radiotherapy – a machine is used to direct beams of radiation at affected parts of your body\n- stereotactic radiotherapy – a more accurate type of external beam radiotherapy where several high-energy beams are used to deliver a higher dose of radiation to the tumour, while sparing the surrounding healthy tissue as much as possible\n- internal radiotherapy – a catheter (thin tube) is inserted into your lung – a&nbsp;small piece of radioactive material is placed inside the catheter and positioned against the site of the tumour before being removed after a few minutes\nFor lung cancer, external beam radiotherapy is used more often than internal radiotherapy, particularly if it&#8217;s thought that a cure is possible. Stereotactic radiotherapy may be used to treat tumours that are very small, as it&#8217;s more effective than standard radiotherapy alone in these circumstances.\nInternal radiotherapy only tends to be used as a palliative treatment when the cancer is blocking or partly blocking your airway.\nA course of radiotherapy treatment can be planned in several different ways.\nRadical radiotherapy is usually given 5 days a week, with a break at weekends. Each session of radiotherapy lasts 10&nbsp;to 15 minutes and the course usually lasts 4 to 7 weeks.\nContinuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (CHART) is an alternative method of delivering radical radiotherapy. CHART is given 3 times a day for 12 days in a row.\nFor stereotactic radiotherapy, fewer treatment sessions are needed because a higher dose of radiation is delivered with each treatment. People having conventional radical radiotherapy are likely to have around 20&nbsp;to 32 treatment sessions, whereas stereotactic radiotherapy typically only requires anything from 3 to 10 sessions.\nPalliative radiotherapy usually only requires 1 to 5 sessions to control your symptoms.&nbsp;\nSide effects of radiotherapy to the chest&nbsp;include:\n- chest pain&nbsp;\n- fatigue&nbsp;\n- persistent&nbsp;cough that may bring up blood-stained phlegm (this is normal and nothing to worry about)&nbsp;\n- difficulties swallowing (dysphagia)&nbsp;\n- redness and soreness of the skin, which looks and feels like sunburn&nbsp;\n- hair loss&nbsp;on your chest&nbsp;\nSide effects should pass once the course of radiotherapy has been completed.\nChemotherapy uses powerful cancer-killing medication to treat cancer. There are several different ways that chemotherapy can be used to treat lung cancer. For example, it can be:\n- given before surgery to shrink a tumour, which can increase the chance of successful surgery&nbsp;(this is usually only done as part of a clinical trial)\n- given after surgery to prevent the cancer returning&nbsp;\n- used to relieve symptoms and slow the spread of cancer when a cure isn&#8217;t possible\n- combined with radiotherapy\nChemotherapy treatments are usually given in cycles. A cycle involves taking the chemotherapy medication for several days, then having a break for a few weeks to let your body recover from the effects of the treatment.\nThe number of cycles of chemotherapy you need will depend on the type and the grade of your lung cancer. Most people require four to 6 courses of treatment over 3 to 6 months.\nChemotherapy for lung cancer involves taking a combination of different medications. The medications are usually delivered through a drip into a vein (intravenously), or into a tube connected to one of the blood vessels in your chest. Some people may be given capsules or tablets to swallow instead.\nSide effects of chemotherapy can include:\n- fatigue&nbsp;\n- nausea\n- vomiting&nbsp;\n- mouth ulcers\n- hair loss\nThese side effects should gradually pass once your treatment has finished, or you may be able to take other medicines to make you feel better during your chemotherapy.\nChemotherapy can also weaken your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection.&nbsp;Tell your care team or GP as soon as possible if you have possible signs of an infection, such as a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or more, or you suddenly feel generally unwell.\nAs well as surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, there are a number of other treatments that are sometimes used to treat lung cancer.&nbsp;\nBiological therapies&nbsp;are newer medications. They&#8217;re sometimes recommended as an alternative treatment to chemotherapy for non-small-cell cancer that has spread too far for surgery or radiotherapy to be effective.\nExamples of biological therapies include&nbsp;erlotinib and gefitinib. These are also called&nbsp;growth factor inhibitors because they work by disrupting the growth of the cancer cells.\nBiological therapies are only suitable for people who have&nbsp;certain proteins&nbsp;in their cancerous cells. Your doctor may be able to request tests on&nbsp;a small&nbsp;sample of cells removed from your lung (biopsy) to determine whether these treatments&nbsp;are likely to be suitable for you.\nRadiofrequency ablation is a new type of treatment that can treat non-small-cell lung cancer diagnosed at an early stage.\nThe doctor carrying out the treatment uses a computerised tomography (CT) scanner to guide a needle to the site of the tumour. The needle will be pressed into the tumour and radio waves will be sent through the needle. These waves generate heat, which kills the cancer cells.\nThe most common complication of radiofrequency ablation is that a pocket of air gets trapped between the inner and outer layer of your lungs (pneumothorax). This can be treated by placing a tube into the lungs to drain away the trapped air.\nCryotherapy is a treatment that can be used if the cancer starts to block your airways. This is known as endobronchial obstruction, and it can cause symptoms such as:\n- breathing problems\n- a cough\n- coughing up blood\nCryotherapy is performed in a similar way to internal radiotherapy, except that instead of using a radioactive source, a device known as a cryoprobe is placed against the tumour. The cryoprobe can generate very cold temperatures, which help to shrink the tumour.\nPhotodynamic therapy (PDT)&nbsp;is a treatment that can be used to treat early-stage lung cancer when a person is unable or unwilling to have surgery. It can also be used to remove a tumour that&#8217;s blocking the airways.\nPhotodynamic therapy is carried out in 2 stages. Firstly, you&#8217;ll be given an injection of a medication that makes the cells in your body very sensitive to light.\nThe next stage is carried out 24&nbsp;to 72 hours later. A thin tube&nbsp;will be guided to the site of the tumour, and a laser will be beamed through it. The cancerous cells, which are now more sensitive to light, will be destroyed by the laser beam.\nSide effects of photodynamic therapy can include inflammation of the airways&nbsp;and a build-up of fluid in the lungs. Both these side effects can cause symptoms of breathlessness and lung and throat pain. However, these symptoms should gradually pass as your lungs recover from the effects of the treatment.\nBreathlessness is common in people who have lung cancer, whether it is a symptom of the condition or a side effect of treatment.\nIn&nbsp;many cases, breathlessness can be&nbsp;improved with some simple measures such as:\n- breathing in slowly through your nose and out through your mouth (after treatment for lung cancer, you may see a physiotherapist, who can teach you some simple breathing exercises)\n- making daily activities easier – for example, using a trolley when you go shopping or keeping things you often need downstairs so you don&#8217;t need to regularly walk up and down the stairs\n- using a fan to direct cool air towards your face\n- eating smaller and more frequent meals, and taking smaller mouthfuls\nIf&nbsp;measures like these aren&#8217;t enough to control your breathlessness, you may need further treatment.&nbsp;There are a number of medications that can help improve breathlessness. Home oxygen treatment&nbsp;may be an option in more severe cases.\nIf your breathlessness is caused by another condition, such as a chest infection or&nbsp;a fluid build-up around the lungs (a pleural effusion), treating this&nbsp;underlying&nbsp;cause&nbsp;may&nbsp;help your breathing.\nRead further information:\n- Macmillan Cancer Support: Managing and treating breathlessness \n- Cancer Research UK: Coping with breathlessness\n- The Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation: Managing lung cancer symptoms\nSome people with lung cancer have pain, while others never have any. About 1 in 3 people who are treated for&nbsp;cancer experience some pain.\nPain isn&#8217;t related to the severity of the cancer – it varies from person to person. What causes cancer pain isn’t thoroughly understood, but there are ways of treating it so the pain can be controlled.\nPeople&nbsp;with advanced lung cancer may need treatment for pain as their cancer progresses. This can be part of palliative care and is often provided by doctors, nurses and other members of the palliative care team. You can have palliative care at home, in hospital, in a hospice or other care centre.\nRead further information:\n- Macmillan Cancer Support: Pain \nHaving cancer can lead to a range of emotions. These may include shock, anxiety, relief, sadness and depression.\nPeople deal with serious problems in different ways. It&#8217;s hard to predict how living with cancer will affect you.\nBeing open and honest about how you feel and what your family and friends can do to help you may put others at ease. But don&#8217;t feel shy about telling people that you need some time to yourself, if that&#8217;s what you need.\nRead further information:\n- Macmillan Cancer Support: Cancer and your emotions\nYour GP or specialist nurse may be able to reassure you if you have questions, or you may find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor, psychologist or specialist phone helpline. Your GP practice will have information on these.\nYou may find it helpful to talk about your experience of lung cancer with others in a similar position at a local support group. Patient organisations have local groups where you can meet other people&nbsp;who have been diagnosed with lung cancer and had treatment.\nIf you have feelings of depression, talk to your GP – they can provide advice and support.\nRead further information:\n- The Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation: Lung cancer support groups\n- Macmillan Cancer Support: Depression&nbsp;\nIf you have to reduce or stop work because of cancer, you may find it hard to cope financially. If you have cancer or you&#8217;re caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to financial support.\nIf you have a job but can&#8217;t work because of your illness, you are entitled to&nbsp;Statutory Sick Pay from your employer.\nIf you don&#8217;t have a job and can&#8217;t work because of your illness, you may be entitled to Employment and Support Allowance.\nIf you&#8217;re caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to Carer’s Allowance.\nYou may be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home or you have a low household income.\nIt&#8217;s a good idea to find out early on what help is available to you. You could ask to speak to the social worker at your hospital, who&nbsp;can&nbsp;give you the information you need.\nRead further information:\n- GOV.UK: Benefits and financial support if you&#8217;re disabled or have a health condition\n- Macmillan Cancer Support: Money, finance and insurance\nIf you have a lot of symptoms caused by lung cancer, your GP and healthcare team will need to give you support and pain relief. This is called palliative care. Support is also available for your family and friends.\nAs your cancer progresses, your doctor should work with you to establish a clear management plan based on your (and your carer&#8217;s) wishes. This includes whether you&#8217;d prefer to go to hospital, a hospice, or be looked after at home as you become progressively more ill.\nIt will take account of what services are available to you locally, what&#8217;s clinically advisable and your personal circumstances.\nMore about palliative care\nRead further information:\n- Macmillan Cancer Support: Looking after someone with cancer\n- Marie Curie\nIf you smoke, the best way to prevent lung cancer and other serious conditions is to stop smoking as soon as possible.\nHowever long you have been smoking, it&#8217;s always worth quitting. Every year you don&#8217;t smoke decreases your risk of getting serious illnesses, such as lung cancer. After 10 years of not smoking, your chances of developing lung cancer falls to half that of someone who smokes.&nbsp;Quit Your Way Scotland&nbsp;can offer advice and encouragement to help you quit smoking.&nbsp;\nYour GP or pharmacist can also give you help and advice about giving up smoking.\nResearch suggests that eating a low-fat, high-fibre diet, including at least 5 portions a day of fresh fruit and vegetables and plenty of&nbsp;whole grains, can reduce&nbsp;your risk of lung cancer, as well as other types of cancer and heart disease.\nMore about eating well\nThere&#8217;s&nbsp;strong evidence to suggest that regular exercise can lower the risk of developing lung cancer and other types of cancer.\nAdults should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity each week.\nMore about&nbsp;keeping active"

        "disease": "Lupus",
        "description": "Lupus is a complex and poorly understood condition that affects many parts of the body and causes symptoms ranging from mild to life-threatening.\nThere are some types of lupus that just affect the skin – such as discoid lupus erythematosus and subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Some medications can also cause lupus-like side effects.\nHowever, the term &#8220;lupus&#8221; is most often used to describe a more severe form of the condition called systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which can affect many parts of the body, including the skin, joints and internal organs.\nSymptoms range from mild to severe, and many people will have long periods with few or no symptoms before experiencing a sudden flare-up, where their symptoms are particularly severe.\nEven mild cases can be distressing and have a considerable impact on a person’s quality of life.\nThe rest of this article will focus on SLE.\nSLE can cause a wide range of symptoms, depending on the areas of the body that are affected. The most common symptoms are:\n- fatigue (extreme tiredness)\n- rashes – particularly on the face, wrists and hands\n- joint pain&nbsp;and swelling\nAs the&nbsp;symptoms of SLE can be similar to a number of other conditions, many of which are more common, it can be difficult to diagnose.\nIf you&nbsp;have persistent or troublesome symptoms that you think could be caused by SLE, you should see your GP so they can try to determine the cause.\nRead more about the symptoms of lupus&nbsp;and diagnosing lupus.&nbsp;\nSLE&nbsp;is an autoimmune condition, which means it is caused by problems with the immune system. For reasons not yet understood, the immune system in people with SLE starts to attack and inflame healthy cells, tissue and organs.\nAs with other more common autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, it is thought a combination of genetic and environmental factors&nbsp;may be&nbsp;responsible for triggering&nbsp;SLE in certain people.\nRead more&nbsp;about the causes of lupus.\nSLE is an uncommon condition where around 90% of cases occur in women. The condition is most common in women of childbearing age (between the ages of 15 and 50), but it can also affect people of other ages.\nThe condition tends to be less common in people of white European origin and more common in those of African, Caribbean or Asian origin.\nThere is currently no cure for SLE, but there are different medications that can help relieve many of the symptoms and reduce the chances of organ damage.\nThese medications include:\n- hydroxychloroquine – a medicine that has historically been used to treat&nbsp;malaria, but can also help treat some symptoms of SLE\n- corticosteroids – anti-inflammatory medications\n- immunosuppressants – a group of medicines that suppress your immune system\nWith good levels of support from friends, family and healthcare professionals, many people with SLE are able to manage their condition effectively.\nRead more&nbsp;about treating lupus.\nA few decades ago SLE was regarded as a terminal condition, as many people would die of an associated complication within a few years of being diagnosed.\nAs a result of early diagnosis and advances in treatment, however, the outlook for SLE is now much better. The vast majority of people diagnosed with the condition will have a normal or near-normal life expectancy.\nHowever, some people with SLE are still at risk of life-threatening complications as a result of damage to internal organs and tissues, such as heart attack&nbsp;or&nbsp;stroke. SLE, and some of the treatments for it, can also increase your risk of developing potentially serious infections.\nRead more about the complications of lupus.\nSymptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can vary widely from person to person. Some people may only experience a few mild symptoms, whereas others may be more severely affected.\nEven if you usually have mild symptoms, SLE can &#8220;flare-up&#8221;, with symptoms becoming more severe or new symptoms developing.\nThe 3&nbsp;main symptoms of SLE are fatigue, joint pain and&nbsp;rashes.\nFatigue is one of the most common symptoms of SLE. You may feel very tired even though you&nbsp;get plenty of sleep. Carrying out everyday tasks, such as housework or office work, can leave you feeling exhausted.\nMany people with SLE find that fatigue is the most distressing and disruptive aspect of SLE because it has a negative impact on&nbsp;their work and social life.\nIf you have SLE, you are likely to experience joint pain in your hands and feet. You may find the pain changes from one set of joints to another quite quickly, and is usually worse in the morning.\nUnlike some other conditions that affect the joints, SLE is unlikely to cause your joints to become permanently damaged or deformed.\nMany people with SLE develop rashes on their skin – most commonly on the face, wrists and hands. A rash over the cheeks and the bridge of the nose is particularly common and is known as a &#8220;butterfly rash&#8221; or &#8220;malar rash&#8221;.\nRashes caused by SLE may&nbsp;get better&nbsp;after a few days or weeks, but can last longer or even be permanent.\nRashes caused by SLE can sometimes be itchy or painful, and they may get worse if they are exposed to sunlight. This is known as &#8220;photosensitivity&#8221;.\nSLE can also cause a wide range of symptoms.&nbsp;However, you&#8217;re unlikely&nbsp;to have all of the symptoms listed below, and many people with the condition will only experience&nbsp;the main symptoms.\nOther&nbsp;features of SLE may include:\n- a fever (high temperature)\n- swollen lymph glands&nbsp;(small glands found throughout your body, including in your neck, armpits and groin)\n- recurring&nbsp;mouth ulcers\n- hair loss&nbsp;(alopecia)\n- high blood pressure&nbsp;(hypertension)\n- headaches&nbsp;and migraines\n- stomach (abdominal) pain\n- chest pain\n- depression&nbsp;\n- dry eyes\n- memory loss\n- seizures (fits)\n- problems thinking clearly and difficulty telling the difference between reality and imagination (psychosis)\n- shortness of breath\n- Raynaud&#8217;s phenomenon a condition that limits the blood supply to your hands and feet&nbsp;when it is cold\n- ankle swelling and fluid retention (oedema)\nYou should see your GP if you have persistent or troublesome symptoms that you think could be caused by SLE.\nWhile it is likely that your symptoms are being caused by a more common condition, it is important to see a doctor for a diagnosis.\nRead more about diagnosing lupus.\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune condition, which means it is caused by problems with the immune system.\nThe immune system is the body’s natural defence against illness and infection. When the immune system detects the presence of an infectious agent, such as bacteria or a virus, it sends white blood cells and antibodies to attack it.\nIn cases of SLE, antibodies released by the immune system can attack healthy tissue, cells and organs.\nIt&#8217;s not clear exactly why this happens, although most experts think SLE has more than one cause. It has been suggested that there may be a number of genetic factors that make people more susceptible to the condition, and that it also takes one or more environmental factors to trigger SLE in those who are susceptible.\nPossible genetic and environmental factors are discussed in more detail below.\nBrothers and sisters of people with SLE are much more likely to develop the condition than the population at large.\nResearchers have identified a number of different genetic mutations that seem to make people more susceptible to developing SLE. A genetic mutation occurs when normal instructions carried in certain genes become &#8220;scrambled&#8221;, resulting in the body’s processes not working normally.\nMost faulty genes are associated with regulating certain functions of the immune system, which may explain why the immune system in people with SLE starts to malfunction.\nA number of environmental factors may be responsible for triggering SLE in vulnerable individuals, although the evidence for many of these is limited.\nPossible environmental factors that have been suggested include:\n- exposure to sunlight (ultraviolet light)\n- hormonal changes that occur during a woman’s lifetime, such as during&nbsp;puberty or pregnancy\n- certain infections, such as by the&nbsp;Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) – a common viral infection that doesn&#8217;t usually cause any symptoms\n- smoking\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can be difficult to diagnose, as it has similar symptoms to several other, far more common, conditions.\nDiagnosis may also be difficult&nbsp;because&nbsp;symptoms can vary greatly from person to person, and they may change over time. For example, there may be periods where your symptoms are not very noticeable, or times when they flare up and become more severe.\nFor a confident diagnosis of SLE to be made, you will need to have several symptoms of lupus and a number of&nbsp;blood tests may need to be carried out.\nSome of the blood tests that may be carried out are described below.\nA blood test called the&nbsp;erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) test can be used to&nbsp;determine whether there is any inflammation in your body.\nThis can be useful in diagnosing SLE because the condition can cause&nbsp;many areas of the body to become inflamed (swell), including&nbsp;the joints and internal organs.\nThe test works by measuring how long it takes for red blood cells to fall to the bottom of&nbsp;a test tube. The quicker they fall, the more likely it is that there are high levels of inflammation.\nAn anti-nuclear antibody test checks&nbsp;whether there is a certain type of antibody cell in your blood, known as the anti-nuclear antibody. Approximately 95% of people with SLE have this antibody.\nHowever, it is possible to have the anti-nuclear antibody without having SLE, so the anti-nuclear antibody test is not a definitive way of testing for the condition.&nbsp;Other blood tests will also be needed to confirm the diagnosis.\nAn anti-DNA test also checks for a certain type of antibody in your blood, known as the anti-DNA antibody. If you have the anti-DNA antibody, it is highly likely that you have SLE. However, the antibody is only found in around 70% of people with the condition.\nThe level of anti-DNA antibodies increases when SLE is more active, so during a flare-up of symptoms your reading from this test may be greater than normal.\nComplement is a chemical in the blood that forms part of your immune system.&nbsp;The level of this chemical may be tested to check how active your SLE is. The level of complement in your blood decreases when SLE is more active.\nOnce you have been diagnosed with SLE, you will normally need regular&nbsp;monitoring to see&nbsp;how the condition is affecting your body.\nIf you have SLE it is possible you may&nbsp;develop other conditions, such as kidney problems. Monitoring your condition will allow your doctor to check for these complications and, if necessary, treat them as soon as possible.\nYou may need to have scans, such as an X-ray, ultrasound scan,&nbsp;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan&nbsp;or a computerised tomography (CT) scan&nbsp;to check whether SLE is affecting your internal organs.\nRead more about the complications of lupus.\nThere is currently no cure for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but treatments that can ease the symptoms and make it easier to live with are available.\nIn most cases, treatment will involve a combination of self-care measures and medication.\nExposure to sunlight can sometimes make symptoms such as rashes worse, and it&#8217;s&nbsp;important to protect your skin when&nbsp;in the sun.\nThis means wearing clothing that covers your skin, a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses. You will also need to apply sunscreen with a high SPF to prevent sunburn. However, some people with lupus&nbsp;are not sun-sensitive and do not need to take extra precautions.\nAs people get most of their&nbsp;vitamin D&nbsp;as a result of&nbsp;direct sunlight on&nbsp;the skin, there is a risk you&nbsp;may not get enough of this vitamin if you need to avoid sun exposure.&nbsp;This means you may need to make an extra effort to include good sources of vitamin D in your diet to avoid problems such as osteoporosis (weakened bones), and you may be advised to take vitamin D supplements.\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a common painkilling medication that reduces inflammation in the body. If you experience joint or muscle pain as a result of SLE, you may be prescribed a NSAID to help ease your symptoms.\nCommonly prescribed NSAIDs for SLE include ibuprofen, naproxen&nbsp;and diclofenac.\nYou can buy some NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, over the counter. These NSAIDs may be suitable if your joint or muscle pain is mild. For more severe pain, you will need stronger medication prescribed by your GP.\nNSAIDs may not be suitable for people who have stomach, kidney or liver problems, or have had these problems in the past. They may also be unsuitable for people with asthma. Your GP will advise&nbsp;about which NSAID is right&nbsp;for you.\nIf taken in high doses or over long periods of time, NSAIDs can damage your stomach lining, which may cause internal bleeding.\nIf you need to take NSAIDs on a long-term basis, your GP will carefully monitor you to check for any problems, and you may be prescribed an additional medication called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to protect your stomach.\nHydroxychloroquine&nbsp;is a medicine&nbsp;that has been&nbsp;used to treat malaria, but&nbsp;is also effective in treating some of the symptoms of SLE, such as rashes, joint and muscle pain, and fatigue.\nYou will usually have to take hydroxychloroquine for 6 to 12 weeks before you&nbsp;notice any benefit.\nMost expert doctors recommend&nbsp;people with SLE take hydroxychloroquine on a long-term basis as a way of controlling their symptoms, helping to prevent flare-ups and to prevent development of more serious problems from lupus.\nSide effects of hydroxychloroquine are uncommon, but may include indigestion, diarrhoea,&nbsp;headaches and&nbsp;rashes.\nHydroxychloroquine may also cause more serious side effects in a small number of people. For example, in rare cases, this medicine can cause&nbsp;eye damage. Contact your GP or specialist immediately if you experience vision problems while taking hydroxychloroquine.\nIf your GP or specialist feels it is necessary, you may need regular eye examinations.\nCorticosteroids&nbsp;are&nbsp;a type of medicine that help reduce inflammation quickly. They can be very effective in treating symptoms of SLE, but are usually only prescribed if the condition is severe.\nIf you have severe symptoms of SLE, or if you are experiencing a flare-up, you may be given a large dose of corticosteroids to help bring your symptoms under control. As your symptoms ease, your dosage can gradually be reduced.\nWhen prescribing corticosteroids, the lowest effective dosage is always given. This is because high doses or long-term use of corticosteroids can cause side effects. These may include:\n- thinning of your bones\n- thinning of your skin\n- weight gain\n- high blood pressure (hypertension)\nCorticosteroids are a safe and effective form of treatment, provided&nbsp;they are taken correctly and under the supervision of your GP or specialist. They will tailor the steroid dose to your disease activity, to minimise side effects while effectively controlling the condition.\nImmunosuppressants are a type of medicine that suppress your immune system. They can help improve your symptoms of SLE by limiting the damage&nbsp;your immune system causes when it attacks healthy parts of your body.\nCommonly prescribed immunosuppressant medicines include azathioprine,&nbsp;methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil&nbsp;and cyclophosphamide.\nImmunosuppressants are sometimes used in conjunction with corticosteroids (see above) because these medicines may ease your symptoms more effectively when used together. Alternatively, the use of immunosuppressant medication may allow your corticosteroid dose to be reduced.\nImmunosuppressant medication is usually only prescribed if you have severe SLE. This is because this type of medication is powerful and can cause side effects such as:\n- loss of appetite\n- vomiting\n- diarrhoea\n- swollen gums\n- bruising or bleeding more easily\n- headache\n- acne\n- extra hair growth\n- weight gain\n- liver damage\n- an increased risk of infection (see below)\nMethotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil and cyclophosphamide can also cause birth defects if they are taken during pregnancy, so you should use a reliable form of contraception if you are taking these medications and are sexually active. If you are trying to become pregnant, an alternative medication such as azathioprine can be used.\nTell your GP if a side effect becomes particularly troublesome, as&nbsp;it may mean your dose needs to be adjusted.\nTaking immunosuppressant medication can increase your risk of developing an infection. This is a particularly serious&nbsp;concern for people with SLE, because the organ damage that can occur as a result&nbsp;of the condition means infections are more likely to be life-threatening.\nIt is therefore&nbsp;very important to report any&nbsp;symptoms of a possible infection to your GP immediately.\nSymptoms of infection may sometimes be similar to a flare up of&nbsp;SLE and include:\n- a fever (high temperature)\n- a&nbsp;cough or&nbsp;breathlessness\n- burning when passing urine or&nbsp;passing blood in&nbsp;your urine\n- diarrhoea\nYou should also try to avoid contact with anyone known to have an infection – even if it is an infection you were previously immune to, such as&nbsp;chickenpox or measles.&nbsp;This is because your previous immunity to these conditions will probably be suppressed (lowered).\nRituximab&nbsp;is a new type of medication&nbsp;used in people with severe SLE&nbsp;that&nbsp;doesn&#8217;t respond to other treatments.\nRituximab was originally designed to treat certain types of cancer, such as lymphoma, but it has since proved effective in treating a number of autoimmune conditions, such as SLE and rheumatoid arthritis.\nRituximab works by locking on to and killing cells called &#8220;B-cells&#8221;, which produce antibodies responsible for the symptoms of SLE. It is administered directly into your vein over the course of several hours, known as an infusion.\nRituximab is not currently licensed for treating SLE in the UK, but your specialist may consider it an appropriate treatment for you. If your doctor suggests using rituximab, they should tell you that there are currently some uncertainties about how effective or safe&nbsp;it is in treating SLE.\nCommon side effects of rituximab include:\n- flu-like symptoms, such as chills and a high temperature\n- dizziness\n- vomiting\nIn rare cases, rituximab can cause a more serious allergy-like reaction. Most reactions occur during or shortly after the treatment is given, so you will be closely monitored once your treatment begins.\nBelimumab is a new medication given to people with active SLE who don’t respond to other treatments.\nIt&nbsp;works by binding to growth factors that are needed for the survival of B-cells. It is given directly into your vein over several hours, known as an infusion. The first 3&nbsp;doses are given 14 days apart, and&nbsp;the medication is usually given once a month thereafter.\nBelimumab is licensed for treating SLE in the UK, and there may be instances where your specialist may consider it an appropriate treatment for you. If your doctor suggests using belimumab, they should tell you that there are currently some uncertainties about how effective or safe it is in treating SLE.\nCommon side effects of belimumab include:\n- flu-like symptoms, such as chills and a high temperature\n- nausea and diarrhoea\n- headache\n- difficulty sleeping (insomnia)\n- a cough,&nbsp;sore throat and blocked or runny nose\n- joint pain\n- increased risk of infections\n- changes in blood pressure\nIn rare cases, belimumab can cause a more serious allergy-like reaction. Most reactions occur during or shortly after the treatment is given, so you will be closely monitored once your treatment begins.\nIf your symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are mild or well-controlled, you may find it barely affects your day-to-day life and that you do not have any complications.\nHowever, for some people, SLE can be a more serious condition&nbsp;that can cause life-threatening complications. Some of&nbsp;these&nbsp;complications are outlined below.\nAround 1&nbsp;in every 3&nbsp;people with SLE&nbsp;will develop a potentially serious kidney disease called lupus nephritis, which is caused by prolonged inflammation of the kidneys.\nLupus nephritis tends to develop relatively early in the course of SLE, usually within five years of diagnosis.\nSymptoms of lupus nephritis can include:\n- swelling of your feet (oedema)\n- headaches\n- dizziness\n- blood in your urine\n- a frequent need to urinate\nLupus nephritis can also cause high blood pressure (hypertension). If left untreated, it can put you at risk of developing life-threatening problems such as a&nbsp;heart attack or&nbsp;stroke.\nIn many cases, lupus nephritis does not cause any noticeable symptoms. However, this does not mean the condition is not dangerous, as the kidneys could still be being damaged.\nIf you have SLE, it is likely you will need to have regular blood tests&nbsp;so the condition of your kidneys can be carefully monitored. If you develop lupus nephritis, it can usually be successfully controlled using immunosuppressants such as mycophenolate mofetil or cyclophosphamide.\nIn a small number of cases, the kidney damage can become severe enough to require treatment with&nbsp;dialysis (where a machine is used to&nbsp;replicates many of the kidneys&#8217; functions) or a kidney transplant.\nCardiovascular disease (CVD)&nbsp;is a general term for any type of health condition that affects the heart and arteries. It is often associated with&nbsp;blood clots and&nbsp;atherosclerosis&nbsp;(hardening and narrowing of the arteries).\nExamples of CVD include coronary heart disease, angina&nbsp;(chest pain caused by the heart&nbsp;not receiving enough blood), heart attack and stroke.\nPeople with SLE are more likely to develop CVD&nbsp;than the general population, because SLE can cause your heart and arteries to become inflamed and damaged.\nIf you have SLE, you can reduce your risk of CVD by making health lifestyle chances, such as:\n- stopping smoking&nbsp;if you smoke\n- eating a healthy, balanced diet low in saturated fat, sugar and salt, and containing at least five portions of fruit and vegetables a day\n- maintaining a healthy weight\n- exercising regularly – at least&nbsp;150 minutes (two-and-a-half hours) a week of exercise strenuous enough to leave you slightly out of breath is recommended\n- cutting down on your alcohol consumption\nSLE does not usually affect fertility, but it can increase your risk of experiencing pregnancy complications, such as:\n- pre-eclampsia&nbsp;(a condition that causes high blood pressure during pregnancy)\n- premature delivery\n- miscarriage\n- stillbirth\nSome children of women with SLE can also be born with&nbsp;heart block (where electrical pulses that control the beating of the heart are disrupted) and rashes. This is known as &#8220;neonatal lupus syndrome&#8221;.\nIf you have SLE and are thinking of having a baby, it is best to plan this carefully with your doctors if possible. The risk of complications is higher if you become pregnant during periods where your symptoms are particularly severe, so you will usually be advised to try to avoid getting pregnant until your symptoms are better controlled.\nIf you do become pregnant, you will need to be monitored closely by your specialist and&nbsp;by an obstetrician, so they can check for any problems."

        "disease": "Lyme disease",
        "description": "Information on Lyme disease, including the symptoms and treatments\nLyme disease is a bacterial infection spread to humans by infected ticks. It’s also known as Lyme borreliosis.\nTicks are tiny spider-like creatures found in woodland and moorland areas, grassy places, parks and gardens. They feed on the blood of birds and mammals, including humans.\nLyme disease is usually easier to treat the earlier it’s diagnosed.\nMore about tick bites\nIf a tick bites an animal carrying the bacteria that cause Lyme disease, the tick can become infected. The tick can then transfer the bacteria to a human by biting them.\nTicks don’t jump or fly. They climb on to your clothes or skin if you brush against something they’re on. They then bite into the skin and start to feed on your blood.\nYou’re more likely to become infected the longer the tick is attached to your skin. This means that removing them quickly is important. Ticks are very small and their bites are not painful, so you may not realise you have one attached to your skin.\nTicks are found throughout the UK and in other parts of Europe and North America. There are a high number of ticks in the Scottish Highlands.\nThey can be found in any areas with deep or overgrown plants where they have access to animals to feed on.\nThey’re common in woodland and moorland areas, but can also be found in gardens or parks.\nMany people with early symptoms of Lyme disease develop a circular rash around the tick bite. The rash:\n- usually develops around 3 to 30 days after you have been bitten\n- may look like a bull’s-eye on a dart board\n- will be red\n- may feel slightly raised at the edges\n- may get bigger over several days or weeks\n- is usually around 15 cm (6 inches) across, but it can be smaller or much larger\nSome people may develop several rashes in different parts of their body.\nAround 1 in 3 people with Lyme disease will not develop a rash.\nSome people with Lyme disease have flu-like symptoms in the early stages, like:\n- tiredness (fatigue)\n- muscle pain\n- joint pain\n- headaches\n- a high temperature (fever)\n- chills\n- neck stiffness\n- \nYou&#8217;ve been bitten by a tick and you:\nRemember to tell them you&#8217;ve been bitten by a tick.\nDiagnosing Lyme disease is often difficult. Many of the symptoms are similar to other conditions.\nThere are 2 kinds of blood test used to diagnose Lyme disease. The tests are not always accurate in the early stages of Lyme disease. You may need to be tested more than once if you still have symptoms after a negative result.\nIf you have symptoms of Lyme disease, you’ll usually be given antibiotics.\nIf you’re prescribed antibiotics, it’s important to finish the course even if you’re feeling better. This will help to ensure all the bacteria are killed.\nIf your symptoms are particularly severe, you may need antibiotic injections (intravenous antibiotics).\nSome of the antibiotics used to treat Lyme disease can make your skin more sensitive to sunlight. You should avoid prolonged exposure to the sun. You should also not use sunbeds until after you have finished the treatment.\nIn some cases, symptoms can persist after antibiotic treatment has finished. This is called post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. There’s currently no agreement on the best treatment for this because the underlying cause is not yet clear.\nBe wary of internet sites offering alternative diagnostic tests and treatments. These may not be supported by scientific evidence.\nMore serious symptoms may develop if Lyme disease is not treated, or it&#8217;s not treated early. These symptoms can include:\n- pain and swelling in the joints\n- nerve problems – like numbness or pain in your limbs\n- memory problems\n- difficulty concentrating\n- heart problems\nSome of these problems will get better with treatment. But, they can continue if treatment starts late.\nSome people with Lyme disease can develop long-term symptoms. These may be like the symptoms of fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome. This is known as post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome.\nIt&#8217;s not clear why this happens but it may be linked to overactivity of your immune system.\nThere’s currently no vaccine to prevent Lyme disease. The best way to prevent it is to adopt easy habits when you’re in the countryside or near wildlife.\nThe risk of getting Lyme disease is higher:\n- for people who spend time in woodland or moorland areas\n- from March to October because more people take part in outdoor activities\nUsually only a small number of ticks carry the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. Being bitten doesn’t mean you’ll definitely be infected. But, it’s important to be aware of the risk and speak to a GP if you start to feel unwell.\n&copy; 2025 NHS 24 &#8211; v1.1.1.17852"

        "disease": "Lymphoedema",
        "description": "Lymphoedema is a chronic (long-term) condition that causes swelling in the body&#8217;s tissues. It can affect any part of the body, but usually develops in the arms or legs.\nOther symptoms of lymphoedema can include an aching, heavy feeling in affected body parts and difficulty moving them.\nLymphoedema can get worse if it&#8217;s not treated, so you should speak to a doctor if you think you may have the condition.\nRead more about the symptoms of lymphoedema&nbsp;and diagnosing lymphoedema\nLymphoedema is caused by a problem with the lymphatic system. This is a network of vessels and glands distributed throughout the body. Its major functions are helping to fight infection and drain excess fluid from tissues.\nAbnormal development of the lymphatic system, damage to it, and/or an increase in fluid in the body tissues can all lead to lymphoedema.\nThere are two main types of lymphoedema:\n- primary lymphoedema – caused by faulty genes affecting the development of the lymphatic system; it can develop at any age, but usually occurs in early adulthood\n- secondary lymphoedema – caused by damage to the lymphatic system or problems with the movement and drainage of fluid in the lymphatic system, often due to an infection, injury, cancer treatment, inflammation of the limb or a lack of limb movement&nbsp;\nRead more about the&nbsp;causes of lymphoedema\nA recent study has suggested that over 200,000 people in the UK may be living with lymphoedema.&nbsp;\nSecondary lymphoedema has been shown to affect approximately one in five women after breast cancer treatment.\nPrimary lymphoedema is less common than secondary lymphoedema, and is estimated to affect around one in every 6,000 people.\nThere is no cure for lymphoedema, but it is usually possible to control the main symptoms using techniques to minimise fluid build-up and stimulate the flow of fluid through the lymphatic system.\nThese include wearing compression garments, taking good care of your skin, moving and exercising regularly, having a healthy diet and lifestyle, and using specialised massage techniques.\nRead more about&nbsp;treating lymphoedema and preventing lymphoedema\nThe build-up of fluid in the tissues of people with lymphoedema means they are more vulnerable to infection.\nIn particular, a bacterial infection of the skin called&nbsp;cellulitis is commonly reported in people with the condition.\nRead more about the&nbsp;complications of lymphoedema\nThe main symptom of lymphoedema is swelling in all or part of a limb or another part of the body, which can cause problems fitting into clothes, or jewellery and watches starting to feel tight.\nAt first, the swelling may come and go. It may get worse during the day and then go down overnight. Without treatment, it will usually become more severe and persistent.\nOther symptoms in an affected body part can include:\n- an aching, heavy feeling\n- difficulty with movement\n- repeated skin infections\n- the skin becoming hard and tight\n- folds developing in the skin\n- wart-like growths developing on the skin\n- a leakage of fluid through the skin\nWhen these symptoms start depends on what is causing the condition.\nIf lymphoedema is caused by abnormal development of the lymphatic system (a network of channels and glands distributed throughout the body that remove unwanted bacteria and particles from the body), the symptoms can develop at any age, but most commonly start during infancy, adolescence or early adulthood.\nIn these cases, the swelling may start on one side of the body to begin with, although the other side will usually become swollen as well over time – particularly the lower leg.\nIf lymphoedema is caused by damage to the lymphatic system, the symptoms can develop at any time. For example, if your lymphatic system is damaged due to treatment for&nbsp;breast cancer, lymphoedema may not develop for several months or even years.\nRead more about the causes of lymphoedema\nIf you are at risk of developing lymphoedema because you have had treatment for&nbsp;cancer, you may be offered an assessment for the condition as part of your treatment aftercare plan. Speak to your consultant or specialist nurse if you have any concerns.\nIf you think you may have lymphoedema, but not as a result of treatment for cancer, see your GP.\nRead more about diagnosing lymphoedema\nThere are two types of lymphoedema, called primary and secondary lymphoedema, which have different causes.\nThe main causes of primary and secondary lymphoedema are outlined below.\nPrimary lymphoedema is caused by alterations (known as mutations) in genes responsible for the development of the lymphatic system (a network of channels and glands distributed throughout the body that help fight infection and remove excess fluid from the body).\nThese &#8220;faulty&#8221; genes result in the parts of the lymphatic system responsible for draining fluid not developing properly or not working as they should.\nPrimary lymphoedema usually runs in families, but not every child born to someone with the condition will develop it themselves.&nbsp;\nSecondary lymphoedema develops in people who previously had a normal lymphatic system.\nIt can have a number of different causes. Some of the most common causes are explained below.\nCancer cells can spread around the body through the lymphatic system, so part of the treatment for the condition can involve surgically removing sections of the lymphatic system potentially containing cancerous cells.\nAlthough the surgeon will try to ensure limited damage to your lymphatic system, this isn&#8217;t always possible.\nThere is a particular risk of lymphoedema occurring as a complication of treatment for:\n- breast cancer\n- melanoma skin cancer\n- gynaecological cancers – such as cervical cancer&nbsp;and vulval cancer\n- genitourinary cancers – such&nbsp;as prostate cancer or penile cancer\nRadiotherapy&nbsp;uses controlled doses of high-energy radiation to destroy cancerous tissue, but it can also damage healthy tissue.\nIf it&#8217;s necessary to use radiotherapy to destroy cancerous cells in your lymphatic system, there is a risk that the system could become permanently damaged and unable to drain fluid properly.\nIn some cases, an infection can cause lymphoedema.\nCellulitis is a bacterial skin infection that can cause lymphoedema. Severe cellulitis can damage the tissue around the lymphatic system, causing it to become scarred.\nAnother infectious cause of lymphoedema is a parasitic infection called filariasis. This is a common cause of lymphoedema worldwide, but is not a risk in the UK.\nConditions that cause tissue to become inflamed (red and swollen) can also permanently damage the lymphatic system. Medical conditions that can cause lymphoedema include:\n- rheumatoid arthritis – which causes pain and swelling in the joints\n- eczema – which causes the skin to become itchy, reddened, dry and cracked\nVenous diseases, which affect the flow of blood through the veins, can cause lymphoedema in some people. The abnormal or damaged veins can result in excessive fluid leaking from the blood into the tissue spaces. This overwhelms and eventually exhausts the parts of the lymphatic system responsible for draining this fluid.\nSome venous diseases that can lead to lymphoedema include:\n- deep vein thrombosis (DVT) – a blood clot in one of the deep veins in the body\n- varicose veins (swollen and enlarged veins) – where poor drainage of blood in the veins causes higher vein pressure, and more fluid passes into the surrounding tissues\nPeople who are obese, particularly those who are severely obese, have an increased risk of developing lymphoedema. It’s not clear exactly why this is, but it has been suggested that the extra fatty tissue affects the lymphatic channels in some way, reducing the flow of fluid through them.\nIn these cases, weight loss is an important part of treatment and even just starting to lose weight can make a big difference.\nIn a small number of cases, lymphoedema can be caused by an accidental injury to the lymphatic system. For example, lymphoedema can sometimes occur after extensive soft tissue loss or bruising.\nMovement and exercise helps lymph drainage, as muscle activity surrounding the lymphatic vessels massages fluid into and along them. Therefore, reduced movement can lead to lymphoedema, because the fluid in the lymphatic system does not get moved on, causing swelling.\nFor example, people who are unable to move fully for a long time due to an illness or surgery may be at risk of lymphoedema.\nIf you&#8217;re being treated for cancer and are at risk of developing lymphoedema, you&#8217;ll be monitored for the condition afterwards. Otherwise, see your GP if you experience symptoms of swelling.\nThere are a number of specialist lymphoedema treatment centres in the UK. Your doctor may refer you to one of these for further assessment. A list of treatment centres near you is available from the Lymphoedema Support Network.\nIn many cases, it&#8217;s possible to make a diagnosis of lymphoedema by:\n- asking about your symptoms and medical history\n- examining the affected body part and measuring the distance around it to see if it&#8217;s enlarged&nbsp;\nAlthough not necessary in most cases, further tests may occasionally be used to assess and monitor your condition. These tests are explained below.\nIn some cases, tests to calculate the volume of an affected limb may be carried out. These may include:\n- a tape measure to measure the circumference of the limb at certain intervals, to calculate its volume\n- water displacement – where you place the affected limb in a tank of water and the amount of water that is displaced is measured to calculate the volume of the limb\n- perometry – infrared light is used to measure the outline of an affected limb and calculate its volume\nDuring a bioimpedance test, electrodes (small metallic discs) are placed on different parts of your body. The electrodes release a small and painless electric charge that is measured using a handheld device. Changes in the strength of the current can indicate the presence of fluid in your tissue.\nImaging tests may also be used to help diagnose and monitor lymphoedema. These include:\n- a lymphoscintigraph – you are injected with a radioactive dye that can be tracked using a special scanner; this shows how the dye moves through your lymphatic system and can check for any blockages\n- a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan – which uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed images of the inside of your body&nbsp;\n- an ultrasound scan – which uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your body\n- a computerised tomography (CT) scan – which uses&nbsp;X-rays and a computer to create detailed images of the lymph nodes\nThese scans can be used to create a clearer picture of the affected tissue.\nThe recommended treatment for lymphoedema is decongestive lymphatic therapy (DLT).\nDLT is not a cure for lymphoedema, but it can help control the symptoms. Although it takes time and effort, the treatment can be used to effectively control your lymphoedema.\nThere are four components to DLT:\n- compression bandages and garments – to move fluid out of the affected limb and minimise further build-up\n- skin care – to keep the skin in good condition and reduce the chances of infection\n- exercises – to use muscles in the affected limb to improve lymph drainage\n- specialised massage techniques – known as manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) – to stimulate the flow of fluid in the lymphatic system and reduce swelling\nEach of these components is described in more detail below.\nDLT usually begins with an intensive phase of therapy, during which you may receive daily treatment for several weeks to help reduce the volume of the affected body part.\nThis is followed by the second phase, known as the maintenance phase. During this, you will be encouraged to take over your own care by carrying out simple self-massage techniques, wearing compression garments and continuing to exercise. This phase of treatment aims to maintain the reduced size of the affected body part.\nYou may then have reviews every few months to check how your treatment is progressing.\nUnlike the blood circulation system, there is no central pump, such as the heart, to move fluid around the lymphatic system. Instead, the lymphatic system uses the massaging effect of surrounding muscles to move the fluid.\nIf you have lymphoedema, you will have special bandages or garments (such as sleeves, gloves, stockings or tights) fitted over any affected limbs. These will support the affected muscles during exercise and encourage them to move fluid out of the affected limb.\nThese may also be applied after a session of MLD, to prevent fluid accumulating in the limb again. This use of compression bandages and garments is known as multilayer lymphoedema bandaging.\nVelcro wraps may be used instead of bandages and have the advantage that the person with lymphoedema can apply them themselves.\nYou will be taught how to correctly apply your own bandages and compression garments, so you can continue to use them during the maintenance period.\nTaking good care of your skin is important, because it will reduce your risk of developing an infection, such as cellulitis.\nRead our page on preventing lymphoedema for more skin care advice.\nYour lymphoedema care team will help devise an exercise and movement plan designed to strengthen and stimulate the muscles involved in lymph drainage. They will also help you to lose weight, if you are overweight. This will be tailored to your requirements and ability.\nYour plan may involve specific limb exercises, as well as gentle activities that involve the whole body, such as swimming, cycling and walking.\nTo begin with, you may receive specialised massages called manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) – usually carried out by a specialist therapist – to move fluid from the swollen areas into working lymph nodes, where it can be drained.\nYour lymphoedema therapist will also teach you a range of simpler massage techniques that you or your carer can use during the maintenance phase of treatment, to help keep the swelling down. These self-massage techniques are known as simple lymphatic drainage (SLD).\nIn a small number of cases, surgery may be considered to treat lymphoedema. There are three main types of surgery that may be useful for the condition:\n- the removal of sections of excess skin and underlying tissue (debulking)\n- the removal of fat from the affected limb (liposuction) – see below\n- the restoration of the flow of fluid around the affected section of the lymphatic system – for example, by connecting the lymphatic system to nearby blood vessels (lymphaticovenular anastomosis)\nThese treatments may help to reduce the size of areas of the body affected by lymphoedema, but some are still experimental – particularly lymphaticovenular anastomosis – and are not in widespread use.\nLiposuction is where a thin tube is inserted through small incisions in the skin to suck fat out of tissue. It can be used to remove excess fat from an affected limb to help reduce its size.\nOnce the surgery is complete, you will have to wear a compression garment on the affected limb day and night for at least a year to help keep the swelling down.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) states that liposuction for chronic (long-term) lymphoedema appears to be safe, and may be effective in the short term. However, NICE says there is not enough evidence of its long-term effectiveness and safety.\nAccess to liposuction for lymphoedema may be limited, depending on what is available from your local NHS Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG).\nCellulitis is the most common complication of lymphoedema, but psychological issues can also occur as a result of the condition.\nThese complications are explained below.\nMany people with lymphoedema experience repeated episodes of&nbsp;cellulitis (also known as erysipelas). Cellulitis is a bacterial infection of the deep layer of skin (dermis) and the layer of fat and soft tissues (the subcutaneous tissues) that lie underneath the skin. Cellulitis can occur as a result of lymphoedema and can also cause the condition.\nSymptoms of cellulitis can include:\n- redness and a feeling of heat in the skin\n- pain in the affected area\n- a high temperature (fever)\n- chills\nCellulitis can usually be successfully treated with antibiotics, although severe cases may need to be treated in hospital.\nIn some cases, you may be provided with a short supply of antibiotic tablets to use as soon as you notice symptoms of cellulitis. Alternatively, you may be given a long-term course of antibiotics to take to prevent infection.\nLiving with a chronic (long-term) condition that affects your appearance, such as lymphoedema, can cause a great deal of distress and lead to periods of depression.\nIf you have been feeling particularly down for the last few months and you no longer take pleasure in the things you usually enjoy, you may be depressed. If this is the case, talk to your GP or members of your lymphoedema treatment team, because there are effective treatments for depression.\nTalking to other people who also have lymphoedema can be reassuring and decrease feelings of isolation, stress and anxiety. The&nbsp;Lymphoedema Support Network offers information and advice, and can put you in touch with a support group in your area.\nRemember: if you persevere with your treatment plan, your symptoms should eventually become less noticeable.&nbsp;\nRead more about&nbsp;treating lymphoedema\nIt’s not possible to completely prevent lymphoedema, but the following steps may help reduce your chances of developing the condition.\nIf you already have lymphoedema, this advice may stop it getting worse.\nThe part of your body affected by lymphoedema is more vulnerable to infection of the build-up of fluid within the tissues. Any cuts in your skin can allow bacteria to enter your body and may quickly develop into an infection.\nSkin infections can also damage your lymphatic system and cause lymphoedema to develop.\nYou can reduce your chances of developing skin infections by:\n- not having injections or blood pressure readings in the affected area whenever possible\n- treating cuts and scratches immediately with an antiseptic cream\n- using insect repellents to prevent&nbsp;insect bites\n- moisturising the skin daily to keep it supple – your GP can prescribe a suitable cream\n- avoiding very hot baths and showers – the heat from saunas, steam rooms and sun beds may also increase the swelling\n- using sun cream with a high sun protection factor (SPF) to prevent sunburn\n- wearing gloves for gardening and household tasks to avoid cuts, if your upper limbs are affected\n- using anti-fungal powder to prevent fungal infections in your skin or feet, if your lower limbs are affected\n- cutting your nails with nail clippers\n- seeing a chiropodist for foot and nail care – but make sure you tell them you have lymphoedema\n- wearing shoes that fit correctly and provide support on the top of your feet, if your lower limbs are affected\n- using an electric razor if you need to shave to reduce the risk of cutting yourself\n- not wearing tight-fitting clothes or jewellery&nbsp;\nContact your GP as soon as possible if you develop symptoms of a possible skin infection, such as redness and a feeling of heat in the skin.\nAdopting a healthy lifestyle may also help reduce your risk of developing lymphoedema, and may help control the condition if you already have it.\nThis includes:\n- eating a healthy diet\n- maintaining a healthy weight\n- exercising regularly"

It&#8217;s caused by a strain of chlamydia bacteria.\nLGV is rare in Scotland and is mostly found in men who have sex with men. LGV in women is very rare.\nMost people with LGV don&#8217;t notice any symptoms and don&#8217;t know they have it. So it&#8217;s important to get tested if you think you&#8217;re infected.\nIf you do develop symptoms, you may experience:\n- swollen lymph glands in the groin (in one or both sides)\n- an ulcer or sore on the penis, vagina or around the anus\nYou may notice some anal symptoms such as:\n- blood or pus from the anus on underwear or toilet paper\n- pain in the anal area when pooing or having receptive anal sex\n- constipation, painful straining or diarrhoea when trying to poo\n- a feeling of incomplete emptying after pooing\nIf you think you might have LGV, get tested for free by:\n- booking an appointment at your local sexual health service\n- contacting your GP practice for an appointment\nIf you test positive for chlamydia, and your symptoms suggest that you might have LGV, the lab will do a further test for LGV.\nThe test for LGV is simple, painless and very reliable. It involves sending a sample from the area of the body thought to be infected to a lab for analysis. This can take up to 3 weeks.\nThe 2 main ways the sample can be collected are:\n- using a swab – a small cotton bud is gently wiped over the area that might be infected, such as inside the vagina, throat, or inside the anus\n- urine sample – this should ideally be done at least 1 or 2 hours after you last peed\nYour partner (s) for the past 3 months should also be tested for LGV.\nAntibiotics will treat the LGV infection.\nThe result of the LGV test can take 3 weeks to come back, so your doctor may advise you to start treatment before the final result is available.\nIf left untreated, LGV can cause scarring and swelling of the skin. It can also cause permanent swelling of the genitals. Rectal infection can also cause swelling and scarring resulting in the risk of long-term bowel complications. Rarely the infection may spread via the bloodstream causing inflammation of the joints or liver.\nTo avoid passing LGV on to your partner(s) you should avoid having sex until both you and your partner have finished your treatment.\nYou can get LGV by having unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex (sex without a condom).\nYour risk of getting LGV may be increased by:\n- chemsex\n- having group sex\n- fisting\n- sharing sex toys that aren&#8217;t washed or covered with a new condom each time they&#8217;re used\nThe best way to reduce your risk of STIs is to practice safer sex. This means using a condom for vaginal, anal and oral sex.\nIf you have been diagnosed with LGV you should get tested for all STIs including:\n- gonorrhoea\n- syphilis\n- HIV"

        "disease": "Malaria",
        "description": "Malaria is a serious tropical disease spread by mosquitoes. If it isn&#8217;t diagnosed and treated quickly, it can be fatal.\nA single mosquito bite is all it takes for someone to become infected.\nIt&#8217;s important to be aware of the symptoms of malaria if you&#8217;re travelling to areas where there&#8217;s a high risk of the disease. This means that you can get medical attention quickly.\nSymptoms are similar to those of flu and usually appear 6 to 30 days after the mosquito bite, but it can sometimes take up to a year for symptoms to start.\nThe initial symptoms of malaria include:\n- a high temperature (fever)\n- headache\n- sweats\n- chills\n- muscle aches or pains\n- vomiting and or diarrhoea\nThese symptoms can start mild and may be difficult to identify as malaria.\nMalaria is a serious illness that can get worse very quickly. It can be fatal if not treated quickly.\nThe effects of malaria are usually more severe in:\n- babies\n- young children\n- pregnant women\n- older people\nYou must tell the healthcare professional that you have been in a country with a risk of malaria, including any brief stopovers.\nMalaria is caused by the Plasmodium parasite. The parasite is spread to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes.\nThere are 5 different types of Plasmodium parasite that cause malaria in humans. They are found in different parts of the world (but do overlap in certain areas) and vary in terms of how severe the infection can be.\nAll malaria infections cause the same symptoms and require immediate medical attention. It&#8217;s not possible to find out which type of malaria you have from symptoms alone.\n- Plasmodium falciparum – mainly found in Africa, it&#8217;s the most common type of malaria parasite and is responsible for most malaria deaths worldwide, though treatment does cure the infection.\n- Plasmodium vivax – mainly found in Asia and South America, this parasite causes milder symptoms but it can stay in the liver for years which can result in symptoms reoccurring if it isn’t treated properly.\n- Plasmodium ovale – fairly uncommon and usually found in West Africa.\n- Plasmodium malariae – this is quite rare and usually only found in Africa.\n- Plasmodium knowlesi – this is very rare and found in parts of southeast Asia.\nThe Plasmodium parasite is spread by mosquitoes. These are known as &#8216;night-biting&#8217; mosquitoes because they most commonly bite between sunset and sunrise.\nWhen a mosquito bites a person already infected with malaria, it becomes infected and spreads the parasite to the next person it bites. Malaria can&#8217;t be spread directly from person to person.\nWhen an infected mosquito bites, the parasite enters the blood and travels to the liver. In the liver, it develops for days to weeks before re-entering the blood. This is the point where symptoms develop and urgent treatment is required.\nAlthough it is very rare, malaria can also be spread from a person with the infection through blood transfusions&nbsp;and sharing needles.\nMalaria is found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. It is not found in the UK or Europe.\nThe fitfortravel website has more information about the risk of malaria in individual countries.\nMalaria is a serious illness that can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated quickly. Severe complications of malaria can occur within hours or days of the first symptoms. This means it is important to seek urgent medical help as soon as possible.\nThe destruction of red blood cells by the malaria parasite can cause severe anaemia.\nAnaemia is a condition where the red blood cells are unable to carry enough oxygen to the body&#8217;s muscles and organs. This can leave you feeling drowsy, weak and faint.\nIn rare cases, malaria can affect the brain. This is known as cerebral malaria which can cause your brain to swell, sometimes leading to permanent brain damage. It can also cause fits (seizures) or coma.\nOther complications that can arise as a result of severe malaria include:\n- liver failure and jaundice – yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes\n- shock – a sudden drop in blood pressure\n- pulmonary oedema – a build-up of fluid in the lungs\n- acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)\n- abnormally low blood sugar – hypoglycaemia\n- kidney failure\n- swelling and rupturing of the spleen\n- dehydration\nIf you get malaria while pregnant, you and your baby have an increased risk of developing serious complications like:\n- premature birth – birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy\n- low birth weight\n- restricted growth of the baby in the womb\n- stillbirth\n- miscarriage\n- death of the mother\nPregnant women are advised to avoid travelling to regions with a risk of malaria.\nVisit your GP, midwife, obstetrician or travel health advisor for a full discussion if you&#8217;re pregnant and are thinking of travelling to a high-risk area. Not all antimalarial tablets are safe in pregnancy and it&#8217;s important you get specific advice.\nIf you travel to an area that has malaria, you are at risk of the infection. It&#8217;s very important that you take precautions to prevent the disease and get treatment immediately if symptoms do develop.\nMalaria can often be avoided using the ABCD approach to prevention, which stands for:\n- Awareness of risk – find out whether you&#8217;re at risk of getting malaria\n- Bite prevention – use insect repellent, cover your skin with clothing, and use a mosquito net to avoid mosquito bites\n- Check whether you need to take antimalarial prevention tablets by visiting a travel health clinic &#8211; if you do, make sure you take the right antimalarial tablets at the right dose and finish the course\n- Diagnosis – seek immediate medical advice if you have malaria symptoms, including up to a year after you return from travelling\nCheck whether you&#8217;re travelling to a malaria risk area on the fitfortravel website\nVisit your local travel clinic for malaria advice as soon as you know that you are travelling to a risk area.\nIf you grew up in a country where malaria is common, any natural protection will be quickly lost when you move. This means you need to protect yourself from infection if you&#8217;re now travelling to a risk area, even if that’s where you grew up.\nFurther information about travel health and vaccinations.\nAvoiding mosquito bites is one of the best ways to prevent malaria. This is particularly important during early evening and at night when mosquitoes bite.\nThere are several steps you can take to avoid being bitten.\nThe most effective repellents contain 50% diethyltoluamide (DEET). These are available in:\n- sprays\n- roll-ons\n- sticks\n- creams\nThere&#8217;s no evidence to suggest that other remedies protect against malaria, such as homeopathic remedies, electronic buzzers, vitamins B1 or B12, garlic, yeast extract spread (Marmite), tea tree oils or bath oils.\nFurther information on mosquito bite prevention is available from the fitfortravel website.\nAntimalarial tablets can help prevent you from developing a malaria infection. For the best protection, you must also follow mosquito bite prevention advice.\nYou must start taking antimalarial tablets before travel and continue taking them whilst travelling in the risk area. Antimalarial tablets must also be taken for a period of time after you have left the risk area.\nHow long antimalarial tablets should be taken will depend on which tablet is used.\nAntimalarial tablets don’t stop malaria from entering your body. However, they do stop the infection from developing inside your body and prevent you from getting ill.\nIf you stop taking your antimalarial tablets early (even when you are back in the UK) you could still become ill with malaria.\nYou may need to take a short trial course of antimalarial tablets before travelling. This is to check that side effects do not occur and that you do not have an adverse reaction. If you do, alternative antimalarials can be prescribed before you leave.\nThere&#8217;s currently no vaccine available that offers protection against malaria.\nThe type of antimalarial tablets that you will be recommended is based on the following information:\n- where you&#8217;re going\n- any relevant family medical history\n- your medical history, including any allergies to medication\n- any medication you&#8217;re currently taking\n- any problems you&#8217;ve had with antimalarial medicines in the past\n- your age\n- whether you&#8217;re pregnant\nIf you&#8217;ve taken antimalarial medication in the past, don&#8217;t assume it&#8217;s suitable for future trips.\nThe type of antimalarial that you will need to take depends on which strain of malaria is carried by the mosquitoes in an area. It will also depend on whether they&#8217;re resistant to certain types of antimalarial medication.\nThe main types of antimalarials used to prevent malaria are:\n- Atovaquone plus proguanil (also known as Maloff protect or Malarone)\n- Doxycycline (also known as Vibramycin-D)\n- Mefloquine (also known as Lariam)\nTo find out what type of antimalarial medication is best for you, visit your local travel clinic.\nIf malaria is diagnosed and treated quickly, you should fully recover. Treatment should be started as soon as possible.\nTreatment begins in a hospital to make sure complications don’t suddenly develop. Treatment is with tablets or capsules. If someone is very ill, treatment will be given through a drip into a vein in the arm (intravenously).\nTreatment for malaria can leave you feeling very tired and weak for several weeks.\nThe type of medicine and how long you need to take it will depend on:\n- the type of malaria you have\n- the severity of your symptoms\n- whether you took preventative antimalarial tablets\n- your age\n- whether you&#8217;re pregnant"

        "description": "A malignant brain tumour is a fast-growing cancer that spreads to other areas of the brain and spine.\nGenerally, brain tumours are graded from 1 to 4, according to their behaviour, such as how fast they grow and how likely they are to grow back after treatment. A malignant brain tumour is either grade 3 or 4, whereas grade 1 or 2 tumours are usually classed as benign or non-cancerous.&nbsp;\nMost malignant tumours are secondary cancers, which means they started in another part of the body and spread to the brain. Primary brain tumours are those that started in the brain.\nThese pages focus on high-grade brain tumours. For information about grade&nbsp;1 or&nbsp;2 tumours, read our pages on&nbsp;low-grade (benign) brain tumours.\nThe symptoms of a malignant brain tumour depend on how big it is and where it is in the brain.\nCommon symptoms include:\n- severe, persistent&nbsp;headaches\n- seizures (fits)\n- persistent nausea, vomiting and drowsiness\n- mental or behavioural changes, such as memory problems or changes in personality\n- progressive weakness or paralysis on one side of the body, vision problems, or speech problems\nSpeak to your GP if you have persistent symptoms of a brain tumour. While it&#8217;s unlikely to be a tumour, it&#8217;s best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis.\nRead more about the&nbsp;symptoms of&nbsp;malignant brain tumours&nbsp;and diagnosing&nbsp;malignant brain tumours.\nMost&nbsp;malignant brain tumours develop from the glial&nbsp;tissue, which supports the brain&#8217;s nerve cells.&nbsp;These tumours are known as&nbsp;gliomas.\nGliomas can be separated further, depending on the cells they developed from. For example:\n- an astrocytoma develops from cells thought to provide the brain&#8217;s framework\n- an oligodendroglioma develops from the cells that produce the fatty covering of nerves\n- an ependymoma develops from the cells that line the cavities in the brain\nIt&#8217;s also possible to have a malignant tumour that&#8217;s a mixture of these types or developed in a different part of the brain.\nBrain tumours can affect people of any age, including children, although they tend to be more common in older adults.\nThe exact cause of primary malignant brain tumours is unknown, although it&#8217;s thought that certain genetic conditions and previous&nbsp;radiotherapy treatment to the head may increase the risk of one developing.\nRead more about the&nbsp;causes of malignant brain tumours.\nA primary malignant brain tumour needs to be treated as soon as possible, because it can spread and damage other parts of the brain and spinal cord.\nSurgery will usually need to be carried out to remove as much of the tumour as possible. This may be&nbsp;followed by&nbsp;radiotherapy&nbsp;and/or chemotherapy&nbsp;to kill any cancerous cells left behind and reduce the chances of the tumour regrowing.\nHowever, malignant tumours will often eventually return after treatment. If this happens, or if you have a secondary tumour, a cure isn&#8217;t usually possible and treatment can instead be used to improve symptoms and prolong life.\nRead&nbsp;more about treating malignant brain tumours.\nLiving with a brain tumour is not easy.&nbsp;You may feel&nbsp;worried and anxious about what&#8217;s going to happen to you and your family. This is perfectly normal.\nIt can help to seek accurate medical information about your specific tumour and its treatment, make sure you&#8217;re closely involved in decisions about your care, and ask your care team about anything you&#8217;re not sure about.\nYou can read more about living with a brain tumour on The Brain Tumour Charity&#8217;s website.\nYour doctor&nbsp;may be able to&nbsp;refer you to a counsellor if you want to talk about the emotional aspects of diagnosis and treatment. There are also many organisations and helplines that can help, such as&nbsp;The Brain Tumour Charity and Brain Tumour Research.\nBeing a carer is not an easy role. When you are busy responding to the needs of others, it can deplete your reserves of emotional and physical energy, and make it easy for you to forget your own health and mental wellbeing.\nResearch on carers’ health shows that high numbers of carers suffer health effects through caring. If you are trying to combine caring with a paid job or looking after a family, this can cause even more stress.\nHowever, neglecting your own health doesn&#8217;t work in the long term. If you&#8217;re caring for someone else, it’s important to look after yourself and get as much help as possible. It&#8217;s in your best interests and those of the person you are caring for.\nFor more information on the support available to you and benefits you may be entitled to, visit&nbsp;Care Information Scotland.\nThe symptoms of a malignant brain tumour depend on how big it is and where it is in the brain.\nWhen symptoms do occur, it is because the brain tumour is either putting pressure on the brain or preventing an area of the brain from functioning properly.\nCommon symptoms of increased pressure within the skull include:\n- severe, persistent&nbsp;headaches – which are typically worse in the morning or when bending over or coughing\n- persistent nausea and vomiting\n- drowsiness\n- vision problems – such as&nbsp;blurred vision,&nbsp;floaters and&nbsp;loss of vision that may come and go\n- seizures (fits) – which may affect the whole body or just involve a twitch in one area\nDifferent areas of the brain control different functions, so the symptoms caused by a brain tumour will depend on where the tumour is located. For example, a tumour affecting:\n- the frontal lobe may cause changes in personality, weakness in one side of the body and loss of smell\n- the temporal lobe may cause&nbsp;forgetfulness,&nbsp;language problems (aphasia) and seizures\n- the parietal lobe may cause aphasia and&nbsp;numbness or weakness in one side of the body\n- the occipital lobe may cause loss of vision on one side\n- the cerebellum may cause a loss of co-ordination, flickering of the eyes, vomiting and a stiff neck\n- the brain stem may cause unsteadiness and difficulty walking, facial weakness, double vision, and difficulty speaking (dysarthria) and swallowing (dysphagia)\nIt&#8217;s important to speak to a doctor if you develop persistent and worrying symptoms that may be caused by a brain tumour. While it&#8217;s unlikely that you have a tumour, it&#8217;s best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis.\nIf your GP is unable to identify a more likely cause of your symptoms, they may refer you to a neurologist for further assessment and tests, such as a brain scan.\nRead more about diagnosing&nbsp;malignant brain tumours.\nMost malignant brain tumours are caused by a cancer that started somewhere else in the body and spread to the brain, through the bloodstream. These are known as secondary tumours.\nCancers that can spread to the brain include lung cancer, breast cancer, bowel cancer and melanoma skin cancer.\nSome primary malignant brain cancers&nbsp;(cancerous tumours that start in the brain) are caused by a previously&nbsp;benign brain tumour becoming cancerous, but usually the exact reason why a primary&nbsp;tumour develops is unknown.\nBrain tumours affect people of all ages, including children, but the risk tends to increase as you get older. Most tumours affect people over 50 years of age.\nPeople with a family history of brain tumours may be at a slightly increased risk of developing&nbsp;a brain tumour themselves.\nIf your brain is exposed to radiation during&nbsp;radiotherapy, your risk of developing&nbsp;certain types of&nbsp;brain tumour later on is increased.\nSome genetic conditions can increase your risk of a brain tumour, such as:\n- neurofibromatosis type 1&nbsp;or&nbsp;neurofibromatosis type 2\n- tuberous sclerosis&nbsp;\n- Turcot syndrome\n- Li-Fraumeni cancer syndrome\n- von Hippel-Lindau syndrome\n- Gorlin syndrome\nUnlike most brain tumours, tumours associated with these conditions tend to develop&nbsp;in childhood or early adulthood.\nThere have been&nbsp;reports in the media about a possible connection between brain tumours and the radiofrequency (RF) energy emitted by mobile phones. RF energy produces heat, which can increase body temperature and damage tissue exposed to it.\nHowever, it&#8217;s thought that the amount of RF energy people are exposed to from mobile phones is too low to produce significant tissue heating or an increase in body temperature.\nResearch is underway to establish whether RF energy has any long-term health effects, but the balance of evidence currently available suggests that it&#8217;s unlikely&nbsp;mobile phones cause health problems.\nSpeak to your GP if you develop any of the symptoms of a malignant brain tumour, such as a persistent and severe headache.\nYour GP will&nbsp;examine you and ask about your symptoms. They may also carry out a simple neurological examination.\nIf they suspect you may have a tumour, or they are not sure what&#8217;s causing your symptoms, you&#8217;ll probably be referred to a neurologist (brain and nerve specialist).\nYour GP or neurologist may&nbsp;carry out a test of your nervous system, called a neurological examination, to look for problems associated with a&nbsp;brain tumour.\nThis&nbsp;may involve tests of your:\n- hand and limb strength\n- reflexes, such as your knee-jerk reflex\n- hearing and vision\n- skin sensitivity\n- balance and co-ordination\n- memory and mental agility (using simple questions or arithmetic)\nA neurologist may also recommend one or more&nbsp;further tests.\nOther tests you may have to help diagnose a brain tumour include:\n- a computerised tomography (CT) scan&nbsp;– this produces a detailed picture of your brain using a series of X-rays\n- a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan&nbsp;– this produces a detailed picture of your brain using a strong magnetic field and radio waves&nbsp;&nbsp;\n- an electroencephalogram (EEG)&nbsp;– where electrodes attached to your scalp record your brain activity to look for any abnormalities\nIf a tumour is suspected, a biopsy (surgical removal of a small piece of tissue) may be taken to establish the type of tumour and the most effective treatment.\nUnder anaesthetic, a small hole (known as a burr hole) is made in the skull and a very fine needle is used to obtain a sample of tumour tissue. You&#8217;ll probably need to stay in hospital for a few days afterwards.\nIf you have a malignant brain tumour, you&#8217;ll usually need surgery to remove as much of it as possible. Radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy may then be used to treat any remaining cancerous tissue.\nThe aim of this is to remove or destroy as much of the tumour as possible, ideally getting rid of the&nbsp;cancerous cells completely. However, this isn&#8217;t always possible and most&nbsp;malignant&nbsp;brain tumours will eventually return after treatment.\nIf your tumour does return after treatment, or you&nbsp;have a secondary brain tumour (where cancer has spread to your brain from another part of your body), a cure isn&#8217;t usually possible. Treatment&nbsp;can instead&nbsp;be used&nbsp;to control your symptoms and&nbsp;prolong life.\nThere are a number of different treatments for&nbsp;malignant brain tumours, and deciding on what you feel is the best treatment can be confusing.\nA group of different specialists called a multidisciplinary team (MDT) will be involved in your care and will recommend what they think is the best treatment option for you, but the final decision will be yours.\nBefore visiting hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions that you&#8217;d like to ask. For example, you may want to find out the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.\nSurgery will be recommended for most people with a malignant brain tumour. If the size or position of the tumour mean surgery is not possible, one or more of the treatments described below may be recommended instead.\nThe main operation used to treat people with brain tumours is called a craniotomy. You will be given a&nbsp;general anaesthetic so you are asleep while the&nbsp;procedure is carried out. An area of your scalp will be shaved and a section of the skull is cut out as a flap to reveal the brain and tumour underneath.\nThe surgeon can then remove as&nbsp;much of the tumour as possible and secure the flap of skull back in place with metal screws.\nAfter surgery, treatment with&nbsp;radiotherapy&nbsp;and/or chemotherapy may be recommended to kill any cancer cells left behind and reduce the risk of the tumour coming back.&nbsp;\nRadiotherapy&nbsp;is a treatment where a beam of&nbsp;high-energy radiation&nbsp;is focused on the tumour to kill the cancerous cells. It can be used after surgery or as the main treatment for tumours that&nbsp;are difficult to remove.\nRadiotherapy is&nbsp;usually given in several doses (fractions) spread over the course of a week. An entire course of treatment will usually last up to 6 weeks in total.\nPossible side effects of radiotherapy for a brain tumour include nausea, temporary hair loss, tiredness and red, sore skin. Read more about the side effects of radiotherapy.\nIn a small&nbsp;number of cases, a similar treatment called&nbsp;proton beam therapy may be recommended. However, this is only suitable in very specific cases and currently, you&#8217;ll need to be referred&nbsp;for treatment abroad if your doctor thinks it&#8217;s appropriate.\nChemotherapy is a medication used to kill cancerous cells. It may be&nbsp;used alongside radiotherapy or on its&nbsp;own, either&nbsp;to help kill any cancerous cells left&nbsp;behind after surgery or to help relieve your symptoms when a cure is not possible.\nChemotherapy medication for brain tumours can be given in a number of ways, including as:\n- tablets (orally) –&nbsp;temozolomide and procarbazine&nbsp;are given in this way\n- injections into a vein (intravenously) –&nbsp;vincristine is given in this way\n- small, disc-like&nbsp;implants placed in the brain during surgery – carmustine&nbsp;can be&nbsp;given in this way, but is&nbsp;only recommended if&nbsp;90% or more of the tumour has been&nbsp;removed\nThe side effects of chemotherapy largely depend on the specific medication you&#8217;re taking. Common general side effects include tiredness, headaches, temporary hair loss and nausea. Read more about the side effects of chemotherapy.\nFor more information about some of the treatments used, see the guidelines from the&nbsp;National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) on carmustine implants to treat gliomas&nbsp;and temozolomide for recurrent malignant glioma.\nStereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)&nbsp;is a special type of radiotherapy that&#8217;s sometimes used to treat brain tumours that can&#8217;t be safely removed with surgery.\nDuring the treatment, several small beams of radiation are used to very accurately&nbsp;deliver a high dose of radiation to the tumour,&nbsp;usually in a single treatment session.&nbsp;\nAs the radiation beams can be aimed very precisely, a high dose of radiation can be delivered to the tumour with minimal damage to the surrounding healthy cells.\nThis means you&#8217;re less likely to experience many of the usual side effects of radiotherapy. Recovery&nbsp;tends to be much faster&nbsp;and an overnight stay isn&#8217;t usually&nbsp;necessary.\nHowever, radiosurgery is currently only available in a few specialised centres across the UK and is only suitable for certain people, based on the characteristics of their tumour.\nYou may also be given medication to relieve some of the symptoms you may&nbsp;have as a result of your&nbsp;brain tumour.\nThese may include:\n- anticonvulsants to prevent seizures (fits)\n- corticosteroids to reduce&nbsp;swelling and pressure in the brain\n- painkillers to treat&nbsp;headaches\n- anti-emetics to prevent vomiting\nDepending on your circumstances, these medications may be given before, after, or instead of surgery.\nIf your tumour is at an advanced stage or in a difficult place in the brain, a cure may not be possible and treatment may only be able to control the cancer for a period of time. This means you will be getting the side effects of treatment without getting rid of the tumour.\nIn this situation, it may be difficult to decide whether or not to go ahead with treatment. Talk to your doctor about what will happen if you choose not to be treated, so you can make an informed decision.\nIf you decide not to have treatment, you will still be given palliative care, which will control your symptoms and make you as comfortable as possible.\nAfter being treated for a brain tumour, you may need additional care to monitor and treat any further problems.\nMalignant&nbsp;brain tumours often grow back after treatment, so regular follow-up appointments will be recommended to look for signs that this may have happened.\nThese appointments may include a discussion of any worrying new symptoms you experience, a physical examination, and&nbsp;occasionally a brain scan.\nYou will&nbsp;usually&nbsp;have follow-up appointments at least every few months to begin with, but they may be needed less frequently over time if no problems develop.\nProblems caused by a brain tumour&nbsp;don&#8217;t always resolve as soon as&nbsp;the tumour is removed or treated. For example, some people have persistent weakness, seizures (fits), difficulty walking and speech problems.\nIn these cases,&nbsp;you may need&nbsp;extra support to help you overcome or adapt to&nbsp;any problems you have. This may include&nbsp;therapies such as:\n- physiotherapy&nbsp;– to help with any movement problems you have\n- occupational therapy – to identify any problems you&#8217;re having with daily activities and&nbsp;arrange for&nbsp;any equipment or alterations to your home that may help\n- speech therapy – to help you with any&nbsp;communication or swallowing problems\nSome people may also need to continue taking medication for seizures for a few months or more after their tumour has been treated or removed.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has made recommendations on the standards of care that brain tumour patients should receive. For more information, see the service guidance for improving outcomes for people with brain and other central nervous system tumours.\nYou may not be allowed to drive for a while after you&#8217;ve had a brain tumour. This will&nbsp;depend on things such as&nbsp;the type of brain tumour you had, where it was in the brain, and what symptoms you have.\nIf you are required to give up your driving licence and notify the DVLA, they will speak to your GP or specialist to determine when you can drive again.\nWith up-to-date scans and advice from your medical team, you may be allowed to drive again once an agreed period has passed and you have successfully completed a medical test to determine your ability to control a vehicle.\nYou can find out about&nbsp;brain tumours and driving on the Cancer Research UK website.\nFlying is usually possible from 3 months after treatment.\nAfter you have been treated for a brain tumour, you must permanently avoid contact sports, such as rugby and boxing. You can start other activities again, with the agreement of your doctor, once you have recovered.\nSwimming unsupervised is not recommended for around 1 year after treatment, as there is a risk you could have an&nbsp;epileptic fit while in the water.\nIt&#8217;s safe to have sex after treatment for a brain tumour.\nWomen may be advised to avoid becoming pregnant for 6 months or more after treatment.&nbsp;If you&#8217;re planning to become pregnant, you should discuss this with your medical team.\nYou&#8217;ll usually tire&nbsp;more easily following treatment for a brain tumour.\nYou may wish to return to work and normal life as soon as possible, but it&#8217;s probably a good idea to return part-time to begin with and only go back full-time when you feel able to.\nIf you&#8217;ve experienced seizures,&nbsp;you shouldn&#8217;t&nbsp;work with machinery or at heights.\nA brain tumour is often life-changing. You may feel angry, frightened and emotionally drained. If it will help, your doctor or specialist may be able to refer you to a social worker and counsellor for help with the practical and emotional aspects of your diagnosis.\nThere are also many organisations that can provide information and support, such as The Brain Tumour Charity and Brain Tumour Research.\nIf you have been diagnosed with a brain tumour, your treatment and medical care will probably be the first thing on your mind. But there are other aspects of your life to think about and it is important to know exactly what kind of assistance is available and where you can get it.\nIf you are finding it hard to cope with day-to-day life, talk about your needs with your doctor or nurse, who will refer you to a social worker. Your social worker will assess exactly the kind of help you need.\nHelp you may need might include:\n- a care attendant, who can help with housework, dressing and washing, or even just keep you company and give your carer a break\n- a &#8216;meals on wheels&#8217; service\n- income support, disability living allowance or attendance allowance\n- equipment and&nbsp;adaptations&nbsp;for your home\nFor more information about what&nbsp;help you&nbsp;might need and how you can access it, visit Care Information Scotland."

        "disease": "Malnutrition",
        "description": "Malnutrition means poor nutrition. Most commonly this is caused by not eating enough (undernutrition) or not eating enough of the right food to give your body the nutrients it needs.\nA balanced diet should provide enough nutrients like calories, protein and vitamins, to keep you healthy. Without this, you may not be getting all the nutrients you need and this can lead to malnutrition.\nMalnutrition can result in:\n- unplanned weight loss\n- muscle loss\n- a low body mass index (BMI)\n- vitamin and mineral deficiencies\nThis can leave you feeling tired, weak and affect your ability to recover from an illness.\nMalnutrition can be difficult to recognise. It can happen very gradually, which can make it very difficult to spot in the early stages.\nCommon signs and symptoms of malnutrition include:\n- loss of appetite and lack of interest in food or fluids\n- unplanned weight loss &#8211; this might cause clothing, rings, watches or dentures to become loose\n- tiredness or low energy levels\n- reduced ability to perform everyday tasks like showering, getting dressed or cooking\n- reduced muscle strength – for example, not being able to walk as far or as fast as usual\n- changes in mood which might cause feelings of lethargy and depression\n- poor concentration\n- poor growth in children\n- increased risk of infection, recurrent infections, taking longer to recover and poor wound healing\n- difficulty keeping warm\n- dizziness\nSometimes, medical conditions cause your body to need more nutrients. Some medical conditions can lead to your body being unable to absorb or use nutrients. These may include:\n- cancer&nbsp;and&nbsp;liver disease&nbsp;that can cause a lack of appetite, persistent pain or nausea\n- COPD, pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema, which cause your body to need more nutrients but can reduce your appetite\n- mental health conditions, like&nbsp;depression&nbsp;or&nbsp;schizophrenia, which may affect your ability to look after yourself\n- Crohn&#8217;s disease,&nbsp;ulcerative colitis&nbsp;or&nbsp;cystic fibrosis&nbsp;that disrupt your body’s ability to digest food or absorb nutrients\n- burns, fractures and post major surgery, due to increased demand for nutrients\n- dementia&nbsp;– people with dementia may be unable to communicate their needs, may use up a lot of calories pacing or may experience a loss of appetite\n- dysphagia&nbsp;– a condition that makes swallowing difficult or painful\n- persistent vomiting or&nbsp;diarrhoea\nSome types and combinations of medication can increase your risk of developing malnutrition. Always check your medicines information and speak to a healthcare professional for advice if you have a concern. Do not stop taking your medication without advice from a healthcare professional.\nPhysical, social and ageing issues can also cause malnutrition.\nPhysical issues can contribute to malnutrition. For example:\n- if your teeth are in a poor condition, if your dentures do not fit, or if you have a sore mouth, eating can be difficult or painful\n- you may lose your appetite as a result of losing your sense of smell and taste\n- you may have a physical disability or other physical impairment that makes it difficult for you to cook or shop for food yourself\nSocial issues that can contribute to malnutrition include:\n- living alone and being socially isolated\n- having limited knowledge about nutrition or cooking\n- reduced mobility\n- alcohol or drug use\n- low income or poverty\n- reliance on food banks\nAs we get older we might become more likely to experience malnutrition. This might be because of how we feel, and physical and social factors. The risk also increases because we&#8217;re more likely to have one or more medical conditions as we get older.\nA healthcare professional can assess you for malnutrition using a screening tool like&nbsp;‘Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool’ (‘MUST’).\nScreen yourself for malnutrition\nIf you&#8217;ve lost weight or your appetite is poor, you can make simple changes to your meals, snacks and drinks to help treat malnutrition.\nChoosing nutrient-dense food and drinks can help improve your calorie intake. This might not be suitable for everyone, especially those with other conditions like dysphagia. Ask your GP, dietitian or nurse for further advice if you&#8217;re unsure.\nYou should speak to a healthcare professional if you&#8217;ve had to limit the fat and sugar you eat in the past due to a health condition like high cholesterol or diabetes.\nTry the following ideas to help you to increase the amount of calories and protein in your diet.\nIf you&#8217;re using vegan alternatives to cheese, butter, cream or milk, try to choose the highest calorie option.\nWatch this video to find out how to fortify your milk with milk powder. You can then use this instead of your usual milk.\nWatch this video to find out how to fortify your juice using egg powder.\nThere are ways you can use every day food and drinks to fortify (add extra nutrients to) your food.\nAdd extra butter to:\n- sandwiches or toast\n- mashed potatoes\n- vegetables\n- sauces\n- baked potatoes\n- snacks like pancakes, crumpets and scones\n- biscuits or crackers\nAdd sugar, jam or honey to:\n- puddings\n- hot drinks\n- milkshakes or smoothies\n- glazed vegetables\n- creamy yogurts\n- fruit\n- porridge or cereal\nAdd cream, chocolate spread, peanut butter or nuts to:\n- porridge\n- fruit\n- sauces\n- soups\n- smoothies or milkshakes\n- snacks (toast, pancakes, crumpets, scones, waffles, rice cakes)\n- ice cream or puddings\nIf you follow a vegetarian or vegan diet, you can use the following foods to fortify your diet:\n- nut butters\n- vegan cheese\n- vegan cream\n- dairy free milks like oat, soya and nut milks (try to choose the sweetened options that provide the most calories)\n- hemp and pea protein powders\n- avocado\n- plant based spreads\nTry to choose the highest calorie and protein options available.\nTry to eat high calorie and protein snacks like:\n- crackers or oatcakes with cheese, pate, hummus or avocado\n- crumpets, scones and pancakes with butter and jam\n- thick and creamy yoghurts\n- soya yoghurts or desserts\n- milk jelly, chocolate pots and mousses\n- custard, trifle and rice pudding pots\n- dried fruit\n- nuts and seeds\n- cereal bar and flapjacks\n- mini pork pie, sausage roll, scotch egg and spring rolls\n- chocolate, biscuits, pastries and cakes\n- crisps with dip\n- fruit with chocolate spread or peanut butter\nWatch this video for ideas of how to add extra nutrients to your food.\nThe&nbsp;British Dietetic Association (BDA) Malnutrition factsheet&nbsp;provides more useful practical advice.\nWatch this video on Vimeo for more tips on how to fortify your food\nOral nutritional supplements (ONS) are a range of liquid and powder products that help support better nutrition.\nThey contain calories, protein, vitamins and minerals to help increase your intake. They&#8217;re designed to be taken alongside your diet and the ‘food first’ advice above to promote progress with your weight.\nDepending on how severe your symptoms are, your healthcare professional might recommend a “feeding tube”.\nThere are different types of tubes. Which one is best for you depends on your diagnosis and symptoms.\nThe most common types of feeding tube include:\n- nasogastric – through your nose and into your stomach\n- nasojejunal – though your nose and further into your digestive tract\n- percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) &#8211; a tube is placed directly into the stomach via your abdomen\nDepending on your condition alternative routes of nutrition may be considered."

        "disease": "Managing genital symptoms",
        "description": "Not all symptoms that you may experience around your genitals are caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI).\nSymptoms can be caused by a variety of natural changes in your body as well as infections that are not sexually transmitted.\nBecome very ill and have:\nSingle ulcers (sores) could be a sign of a recent infection of&nbsp;syphilis, especially if there is no pain.\nPainful ulcers may be due to herpes, other infections or recent trauma. It can help to take a photo of your ulcer so you can show the sexual health clinician at your appointment.\nIf you think you have&nbsp;mpox (monkeypox)&nbsp;or you&#8217;ve come into contact in the last 21 days with someone who has mpox, you should phone your local service before you attend in person.\nThere are many causes of pain in the lower tummy. For example issues of the bowel or urinary tract and many gynaecological conditions.\nSome STIs such as&nbsp;gonorrhoea, or&nbsp;chlamydia, can very occasionally spread up into the womb and cause pelvic pain and/or deep pain during sex.\nIf you have pain like this and think you have been at risk of an STI then you should&nbsp;contact your local service.\nIf there is any possibility that you could be pregnant, take a pregnancy test.\nWhether you have discomfort peeing or not, discharge from the end of the penis could mean that you have an STI such as&nbsp;chlamydia&nbsp;or&nbsp;gonorrhoea.&nbsp;Book a consultation online&nbsp;or contact your local&nbsp;sexual health service&nbsp;for advice.\nGonorrhoea&nbsp;and&nbsp;chlamydia&nbsp;usually affect just the urinary tract. But sometimes infection can spread to the testicle and/or the epididymis (the small tube part next to the testicle).\nThis will cause painful swelling for which you should get treatment urgently.\nBook a consultation online&nbsp;or phone for advice​​.\nHaving multiple genital ulcers could indicate&nbsp;genital herpes&nbsp;which is the same virus that causes cold sores.\nHerpes is an extremely common virus. It sometimes causes symptoms which are mostly self-limiting. This means your immune system will deal with this itself, but it can take a few days for symptoms to settle.\nSometimes the ulcers are itchy before they become sore. There may be pain when peeing because this stings the ulcers.\nMilder cases can be diagnosed and treated by your GP. If you&#8217;re worried about your symptoms, you could also contact your local&nbsp;sexual health service&nbsp;for advice.\nFurther information about herpes simplex viruses\nSometimes hair follicles (the tiny pockets from where each hair grows) around the genitals or groin area can become inflamed. This is called folliculitis. It may be more common if you shave the area. At first it may look like a small pimple. It may be itchy, and sore but in most cases it will resolve on it&#8217;s own. If you have any concerns contact your local&nbsp;sexual health service.\nAnother common cause of new spots or lumps on your genitals is warts.\nAnother possible cause is molluscum. Sometimes, teenagers notice lumps that are completely normal.\nIf you think that the lumps you have noticed are likely to be&nbsp;genital warts&nbsp;they might clear up on&nbsp;their own. One third of warts disappear within 6 months.\nYour GP practice may be able to prescribe treatment for you or refer you to a sexual health clinic if treatment doesn&#8217;t work. Sexual health services available may vary across Scotland.\nGenital skin can be sensitive. Itching is often a sign that you&#8217;re doing something, or using a product, that&#8217;s irritating the skin. If itching is your only symptom, it isn&#8217;t often related to an STI.\nItching around or inside the vagina is often due to&nbsp;thrush. You can get treatment over the counter at your&nbsp;local pharmacy.\nIf you&#8217;ve changed your method of&nbsp;contraception, then you might notice a change in your bleeding pattern. This should settle but if you have any concerns, talk to your contraception provider.\nChlamydia&nbsp;can sometimes cause bleeding after sex or between periods. If you have had unprotected sex with a new sexual partner and notice this type of bleeding, then&nbsp;get tested for STIs.\nRead about what to do if you have a change in your vaginal discharge"

        "disease": "Measles",
        "description": "Measles is an infection that spreads very easily. It&#8217;s unpleasant and can sometimes have serious complications. Having the&nbsp;measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine&nbsp;is the best way to prevent it.\nAnyone can get measles if they haven&#8217;t been vaccinated or they haven&#8217;t had it before. It&#8217;s most common in young children.\nMeasles usually clears in around 7 to 10 days.\nThe first symptoms of measles develop around 10 days after you&#8217;re infected. These can include:\n- cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose, sneezing, and a cough\n- sore, red eyes that may be sensitive to light\n- watery eyes\n- swollen eyes\n- a high temperature (fever), which may reach around 40°C (104°F)\n- small greyish-white spots in the mouth\n- aches and pains\n- loss of appetite\n- tiredness, irritability and a general lack of energy\nThe measles rash appears around 2 to 4 days after the initial symptoms and normally fades after about a week. The rash:\n- is made up of small red-brown, flat or slightly raised spots that may join together into larger blotchy patches\n- usually first appears on the head or neck, before spreading outwards to the rest of the body\n- is slightly itchy for some people\nYou or your child have measles and:\nIf your GP is closed, phone 111.\nYou should phone your GP first before visiting. They can make arrangements to reduce the risk of spreading the infection to others.\nMeasles can be unpleasant, but will usually pass in about 7 to 10 days without causing any further problems.\nOnce you&#8217;ve had measles, your body builds up resistance (immunity) to the virus. It&#8217;s highly unlikely you&#8217;ll get it again.\nHowever, measles can lead to serious and potentially life-threatening complications in some people. These include infections of the lungs&nbsp;(pneumonia)&nbsp;and brain (encephalitis).\nThe measles virus is contained in tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when an infected person coughs or sneezes.\nYou can easily catch measles by breathing in these droplets. Or, if the droplets have settled on a surface, by touching the surface and then placing your hands near your nose or mouth. The virus can survive on surfaces for a few hours.\nPeople with measles are infectious from when the symptoms develop until about 4 days after the rash first appears.\nIf you have measles:\n- stay off school or work for at least 4 days from when the rash first appears\n- regularly wash your hands with soap\n- use and dispose of tissues when you sneeze\n- avoid close contact with anyone who isn&#8217;t fully vaccinated\nMeasles can be prevented by having the&nbsp;MMR vaccine.\nThis is given in 2 doses as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme.\nYou can be vaccinated at any age if you haven&#8217;t been fully vaccinated before.\nIf the MMR vaccine isn&#8217;t suitable for you, a treatment called human normal immunoglobulin (HNIG) can be used if you&#8217;re at immediate risk of catching measles.\nThere are things you can do to help relieve your symptoms.\nIn severe cases, especially if there are complications, you or your child may need to be admitted to hospital for treatment."

        "description": "Meningitis is an infection of the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord (meninges).\nIt can affect anyone, but is most common in babies, young children, teenagers and young adults.\nMeningitis can be very serious if not treated quickly. It can cause life-threatening blood poisoning (septicaemia) and result in permanent damage to the brain or nerves.\nA number of vaccinations are available that offer some protection against meningitis.\nSymptoms of meningitis develop suddenly and can include:\n- a high temperature (fever) over 37.5C (99.5F)\n- being sick\n- a headache\n- a blotchy rash that doesn&#8217;t fade when a glass is rolled over it (this won&#8217;t always develop)\n- a stiff neck\n- a dislike of bright lights\n- drowsiness or unresponsiveness\n- seizures (fits)\nThese symptoms can appear in any order and some may not appear.\nYou should get medical advice as soon as possible if you&#8217;re concerned that you or your child could have meningitis.\nTrust your instincts and don&#8217;t wait until a rash develops.\nPhone 999 for an ambulance or go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department immediately if you think you or your child might be seriously ill.\nPhone 111 or your GP practice for advice if you&#8217;re not sure if it&#8217;s anything serious or you think you may have been exposed to someone with meningitis.\nMeningitis is usually caused by a bacterial or viral infection. Bacterial meningitis is rarer but more serious than viral meningitis.\nInfections that cause meningitis can be spread through:\n- sneezing\n- coughing\n- kissing\n- sharing utensils, cutlery and toothbrushes\nMeningitis is usually caught from people who carry these viruses or bacteria in their nose or throat but aren&#8217;t ill themselves.\nIt can also be caught from someone with meningitis, but this is less common.\nRead more about the causes of meningitis\nVaccinations offer some protection against certain causes of meningitis.\nThese include the:\n- meningitis B vaccine – offered to babies aged 8 weeks, followed by a second dose at 16 weeks, and a booster at 1 year\n- 6-in-1 vaccine – offered to babies at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age\n- pneumococcal vaccine – offered to babies at 12 weeks and between 12 and 13 months old\n- meningitis C vaccine – offered at 12 weeks of age, 1 year\n- MMR vaccine – offered to babies at 1 year and a second dose at 3 years and 4 months\n- meningitis ACWY vaccine – offered to teenagers who are in S3 (around 14 years of age) at school.

Treatments include:\n- antibiotics given directly into a vein\n- fluids given directly into a vein\n- oxygen through a face mask\nViral meningitis tends to get better on its own within 7 to 10 days and can often be treated at home. Getting plenty of rest and taking painkillers and anti-sickness medication can help relieve the symptoms in the meantime.\nRead more about how meningitis is treated\nViral meningitis will usually get better on its own and rarely causes any long-term problems.\nMost people with bacterial meningitis who are treated quickly will also make a full recovery, although some are left with serious, long-term problems. These can include:\n- hearing loss or vision loss, which may be partial or total\n- problems with memory and concentration\n- recurrent seizures (epilepsy)\n- co-ordination, movement and balance problems\n- loss of limbs – amputation&nbsp;of affected limbs is sometimes necessary\nOverall, it&#8217;s estimated that up to 1 in every 10 cases of bacterial meningitis is fatal.\nRead more about the complications of meningitis\nMeningitis is usually caused by a viral or bacterial infection.\nViral meningitis is the most common and least serious type. Bacterial meningitis is rare but can be very serious if not treated.\nSeveral&nbsp;different viruses and bacteria can cause meningitis, including:\n- meningococcal bacteria&nbsp;–&nbsp;there are several different types, called A, B, C, W, X, Y and Z\n- pneumococcal bacteria\n- Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) bacteria\n- enteroviruses&nbsp;– viruses that usually only cause a mild stomach infection\n- the&nbsp;mumps virus\n- the herpes simplex virus – a virus that usually causes cold sores or genital herpes\nA number of&nbsp;meningitis vaccinations&nbsp;provide protection&nbsp;against many of the infections that can&nbsp;cause meningitis.\nThe viruses and bacteria that cause meningitis can be spread through:\n- sneezing\n- coughing&nbsp;\n- kissing\n- sharing utensils, cutlery and toothbrushes\nThe infection is usually spread by people who carry these viruses or bacteria in their nose or throat, but aren&#8217;t ill themselves.\nThe infection can also be spread by someone with meningitis, although this is less common.\nIt&#8217;s possible to get meningitis more than once.\nAnyone can potentially get meningitis, but it&#8217;s more common in:\n- babies and young children\n- teenagers and young adults\n- elderly people\n- people with a weak immune system&nbsp;– for example, those with&nbsp;HIV and those having&nbsp;chemotherapy\nYou can reduce the&nbsp;risk of getting meningitis by ensuring all your vaccinations are up-to-date.\nRead more about meningitis vaccinations\nPeople with suspected meningitis will usually need to have tests in hospital and may need to stay in hospital for treatment.\nSeveral tests may be carried out to confirm the diagnosis and check whether the condition is the result of a viral or bacterial infection.\nThese tests may include:\n- a physical examination to look for symptoms of meningitis\n- a blood test&nbsp;to check for bacteria or viruses\n- a lumbar puncture – where a sample of fluid is taken from the spine and checked for bacteria or viruses\n- a computerised tomography (CT) scan to check for any problems with the brain, such as swelling\nAs bacterial meningitis can be very serious, treatment with antibiotics will usually start before the diagnosis is confirmed and will be stopped later on if tests show the condition is being caused by a virus.\nTreatment in hospital is recommended in all cases of bacterial meningitis, as the condition can cause serious problems and requires close monitoring.\nSevere viral meningitis may also be treated in hospital.\nTreatments include:\n- antibiotics given directly into a vein\n- fluids given directly into a vein to prevent dehydration\n- oxygen through a face mask if there are any breathing difficulties\n- steroid medication to help reduce any swelling around the brain, in some cases\nPeople with meningitis may need to stay in hospital for a few days, and in certain cases, treatment may be needed for several weeks.\nEven after going home, it may be a while before you feel completely back to normal.\nAdditional treatment and long-term support may also be required if any complications of meningitis occur, such as hearing loss.\nYou&#8217;ll usually be able to go home from hospital if you or your child has mild meningitis and tests show it&#8217;s being caused by a viral infection.\nThis type of meningitis will normally get better on its own without causing any serious problems. Most people feel better within 7 to 10 days.\nIn the meantime, it can help to:\n- get plenty of rest\n- take painkillers for a headache or general aches\n- take anti-emetic (anti-sickness) medicine for any vomiting\nThe risk of someone with meningitis spreading the infection to others is generally low. But if someone is thought to be at high risk of infection, they may be given a dose of antibiotics as a precautionary measure.\nThis may include anyone who has been in prolonged close contact with someone who developed meningitis, such as:\n- people living in the same house\n- pupils sharing a dormitory\n- a boyfriend or girlfriend\nPeople who have only had brief contact with someone who developed meningitis won&#8217;t usually need to take antibiotics.\nMost people make a full recovery from meningitis, but it can sometimes cause serious, long-term problems and can be life threatening.\nThis is why it&#8217;s so important to get medical help as soon as possible if you think you or your child has symptoms of meningitis, and why meningitis vaccinations are offered to certain groups.\nIt&#8217;s estimated up to 1 person in every 2 or 3 who survives bacterial meningitis is left with 1 or more permanent problems.\nComplications are much rarer after viral meningitis.\nSome of the most common complications associated with meningitis are:\n- hearing loss,&nbsp;which may be partial or total&nbsp;–&nbsp;people&nbsp;who have had meningitis will usually have a&nbsp;hearing test after a few weeks to check for any&nbsp;problems\n- recurrent seizures (epilepsy)\n- problems with memory and concentration\n- co-ordination, movement&nbsp;and balance&nbsp;problems\n- learning difficulties and behavioural problems\n- vision loss, which may be partial or total\n- loss of limbs&nbsp;–&nbsp;amputation&nbsp;is sometimes necessary to stop the infection spreading through the body and remove damaged tissue\n- bone and joint problems, such as&nbsp;arthritis\n- kidney problems\nOverall, it&#8217;s estimated up to 1 in every 10 cases of bacterial meningitis is fatal.\nAdditional treatment and long-term support may be&nbsp;required if you or your child experience complications of meningitis.\nFor example:\n- cochlear implants, which are small devices that are inserted into the ears to improve hearing,&nbsp;may be needed in cases of severe hearing loss&nbsp;– read more about treatment for hearing loss\n- prosthetic limbs and rehabilitation support&nbsp;may help&nbsp;if it was necessary to amputate any limbs&nbsp;– read more about recovering after an amputation\n- counselling and psychological support may help if the trauma of having meningitis&nbsp;causes problems such as disturbed sleep, bedwetting,&nbsp;or fear of doctors and hospitals\nYou may also find it useful to get in touch with organisations such as the Meningitis Research Foundation or Meningitis Now for support and advice about life after meningitis.\nMeningitis can be caused by a number of different infections, so several vaccinations offer some protection against it.\nChildren should receive most of these as part of the NHS vaccination schedule. Speak to your GP if you&#8217;re not sure whether your or your child&#8217;s vaccinations are up-to-date.\nThe meningitis B vaccine offers protection against meningococcal group B bacteria, which are a common cause of meningitis in young children in the UK.\nThe vaccine is recommended for babies aged&nbsp;8 weeks, followed by a second dose at 16 weeks, and a booster at one year.\nThe 6-in-1 vaccine, also known as the DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB vaccine, offers protection against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, polio, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and hepatitis B.\nHib are a type of bacteria that can cause meningitis.\nThe vaccine is given on three separate occasions when babies are 8, 12 and 16 weeks old.\nMore about the 6-in-1 vaccine\nThe pneumococcal vaccine offers protection against serious infections caused by pneumococcal bacteria, including meningitis.\nBabies receive the pneumococcal vaccine as 2 separate injections, at 12 weeks and between 12 and 13 months old.\nMore about the pneumococcal vaccine\nThe meningitis C vaccine offers protection against a type of bacteria – meningococcal group C bacteria – that can cause meningitis.\nBabies are offered a combined Hib/Men C vaccine at 1 year of age.\nTeenagers and first-time university students are also offered vaccination against meningococcal group C bacteria as part of the combined meningitis ACWY vaccine.\nMore about the Hib/Men C vaccine\nThe MMR vaccine offers protection against measles, mumps and rubella. Meningitis can sometimes occur as a complication of these infections.\nThe vaccine is usually given to babies at 1 year of age. They&#8217;ll then have a second dose when they&#8217;re 3 years and 4 months old.\nMore about the MMR vaccine\nThe meningitis ACWY vaccines offers protection against 4 types of bacteria that can cause meningitis – meningococcal groups A, C, W and Y.\nYoung people who are in S3 (around 14 years of age) at school are advised to have the vaccination.

        "description": "Ménière&#8217;s disease is a rare inner ear condition that can affect your balance and hearing. It cannot be cured, but treatments can usually help your symptoms.\nMénière’s disease most commonly affects people aged 20 to 60. It&#8217;s slightly more common in women than men.\nThe symptoms and severity of Ménière’s disease vary widely from person to person.\nThe main symptoms of Ménière’s disease are:\n- vertigo – the feeling that you, or the environment around you, is moving or spinning\n- tinnitus – hearing sounds from inside your body, rather than from an outside source\n- hearing loss, with a particular difficulty hearing deep or low sounds\n- a feeling of pressure or fullness deep inside the ear\n- feeling or being sick\nSymptoms typically last around 2 to 3 hours. But it can take a day or two for the symptoms to disappear completely.\nThese symptoms usually only affect one ear at first, but both ears may become affected over time.\nOther symptoms include:\n- sensitivity to sound (hyperacusis)\n- distorted sound\nYou or your child:\nThere’s no single test for Ménière’s disease. It can be difficult to distinguish from other conditions with similar symptoms.\nYour GP will ask you to describe your symptoms to find out if there&#8217;s a pattern.\nFor Ménière’s disease to be diagnosed, you’ll have had:\n- at least 2 episodes of vertigo lasting 20 minutes or more within a single Ménière’s disease attack\n- tests that confirm that hearing loss is caused by damage to the sensitive hair cells inside the cochlea (the coiled tube in the inner ear)\n- tinnitus or a feeling of pressure in your ear\nYour GP may also carry out a physical examination to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms.\nIf needed, your GP can refer you to an ear nose and throat (ENT) specialist for further tests.\nMénière’s disease cannot be cured, but treatment can usually help your symptoms.\nPossible treatments include:\n- medicines to treat the symptoms and prevent attacks\n- changes to your eating habits, such as a low-salt diet\n- treatment for tinnitus\n- treatment for hearing loss\n- balance training (vestibular rehabilitation)\n- relaxation techniques\n- surgery – only rarely, in more severe cases\nSome people with Ménière’s disease also find that it affects their mental health.\nSpeak to your GP practice if you’re finding it difficult to cope with the effect Ménière’s disease is having on your life. There are also support groups that can help you.\nIf you have vertigo, there are some safety issues to consider. For example:\n- you should tell your employer if your job involves operating machinery or climbing ladders\n- you may have a higher chance of falling – read about preventing falls for advice on reducing your risk\nIf you drive, you must tell the DVLA about your vertigo.\nGet more information on driving with vertigo on GOV.UK\nThe exact cause of Ménière’s disease is unknown. It’s thought to be caused by a problem with pressure deep inside the ear.\nFactors that can increase your risk of developing Ménière’s disease include:\n- a family history of the condition\n- a chemical imbalance in the fluid in your inner ear"

        "disease": "Mesothelioma",
        "description": "Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that develops in the lining that covers the outer surface of some of the body’s organs. It’s usually linked to asbestos exposure.\nMesothelioma mainly affects the lining of the lungs (pleural mesothelioma), although it can also affect the lining of the tummy (peritoneal mesothelioma), heart or testicles.\nMost cases are diagnosed in people aged 60&nbsp;to 80 and men are affected more commonly than women.\nUnfortunately, it’s rarely possible to cure mesothelioma, although treatment can help control the symptoms.\nThe symptoms of mesothelioma tend to develop gradually over time. They typically don’t appear until several decades after exposure to asbestos.\nSymptoms of mesothelioma in the lining of the lungs&nbsp;include:\n- chest pain\n- shortness of breath\n- fatigue (extreme tiredness)\n- a high temperature (fever) and sweating, particularly at night\n- a persistent&nbsp;cough\n- loss of appetite and unexplained weight loss\n- clubbed (swollen) fingertips\nSymptoms of mesothelioma in the lining of the tummy&nbsp;include:\n- tummy pain&nbsp;or swelling\n- feeling or being sick\n- loss of appetite and unexplained weight loss\n- diarrhoea&nbsp;or&nbsp;constipation\nSpeak to your GP if you have any persistent or worrying symptoms. Tell them about any exposure to asbestos you may have had in the past.\nMesothelioma is almost always caused by exposure to asbestos, a&nbsp;group of minerals made of microscopic fibres that&nbsp;used to be widely used in construction.\nThese tiny fibres can easily get in the lungs, where they get stuck, damaging the&nbsp;lungs&nbsp;over time.&nbsp;It usually takes a while for this to cause any obvious problems, with mesothelioma&nbsp;typically developing more than&nbsp;20 years&nbsp;after exposure to asbestos.\nThe use of asbestos was completely banned in 1999, so the risk of exposure is much lower nowadays. However,&nbsp;materials containing asbestos are still found in many older buildings.\nIf your GP suspects mesothelioma, they will refer you to a hospital specialist for some tests.\nA&nbsp;number of different tests may need to be carried out, including:\n- an&nbsp;X-ray&nbsp;of your chest or tummy\n- a computerised tomography (CT) scan&nbsp;– a number of X-ray images are taken to&nbsp;create a detailed image of the inside of the body\n- fluid drainage – if there’s a build-up of fluid around the lungs or in the tummy, a sample may be removed using a needle inserted through the skin so the fluid can be analysed\n- a thoracoscopy or laparoscopy – the inside of your chest or tummy is examined with a long, thin camera that’s inserted through a small cut (incision) under sedation or&nbsp;anaesthetic; a sample of tissue (biopsy) may be removed so it can be analysed\nThese tests can help diagnose mesothelioma and show how far it has spread.\nThe best treatment for mesothelioma depends on several factors, including how far the cancer has spread and your general health.\nAs mesothelioma is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, treatment is usually focused on controlling the symptoms and prolonging life for as long as possible.&nbsp;This is known as&nbsp;palliative or supportive care.\nPossible treatments include:\n- chemotherapy&nbsp;– this is the main treatment for mesothelioma and involves using medicine to help shrink the cancer\n- radiotherapy&nbsp;– this involves using&nbsp;high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells and it may be used to slow the cancer down and keep it under control\n- surgery –&nbsp;an operation to remove the cancerous area can be done if mesothelioma is detected at a very early stage, although it’s not clear whether surgery is helpful\nYou’ll also&nbsp;probably have treatment for your individual symptoms to help you feel as comfortable as possible. For example, regularly draining fluid from your chest may help your breathing and strong painkillers may help&nbsp;relieve&nbsp;your pain.\nSometimes, a procedure is carried out to stop the fluid coming back again by making the outside of the lungs stick to the inside of your chest (pleurodesis), or a tube is put in your chest to drain the fluid regularly at home. Your doctors should discuss these treatments with you."

        "disease": "Metacarpal fracture of the hand",
        "description": "Your injury may be referred to as a fracture, break or crack. These terms all mean the same thing.\nWhen you have a fracture, it&#8217;s not just the bone that&#8217;s affected. You&#8217;ll also have injured some of the soft tissues around it. Soft tissues include the:\n- muscles\n- ligaments\n- tendons\n- nerves\nAfter a metacarpal fracture of the hand, most of the healing happens between 3 to 4 weeks.\nIt&#8217;s normal to have aches and discomfort beyond this. This often happens when you try activities you haven’t done for a while.\nIt&#8217;s also normal for the area to be more sensitive for several months after the injury.\nThere are some things that might affect your recovery.\nSmoking affects all your tissues and slows facture healing times. In some people, it can stop healing altogether.\nStopping smoking as your fracture heals will help to ensure the best recovery.\nGet help to stop smoking.\nSome medical conditions, like diabetes, may slow down the healing process.\nEating a healthy diet and keeping yourself active will help your recovery.\nSome medications can slow down fracture healing. If you have concerns about your medication talk to a healthcare professional.\nAnti-inflammatory medication, like Ibuprofen or Naproxen, have been shown to delay healing.\nA metacarpal fracture of the hand is usually a minor fracture. However, it can be debilitating as you can&#8217;t use your hand normally.\nEven though it will be uncomfortable, it&#8217;s important to move the fingers early on. This will improve the function of the hand and help your recovery.\nIt&#8217;s normal to have some discomfort in the areas around your fracture. The areas affected can be:\n- other soft tissues\n- nearby joints\n- areas that have been immobilised\nPain can change from day to day and it doesn’t always depend on what you&#8217;re doing. It&#8217;s common to have pain at rest.\nIt&#8217;s normal to have some pain even when your fracture has healed. Some people also experience discomfort in the fracture site during colder weather.\nYour local pharmacy can give you advice on managing pain after a fracture.\nUse Scotland&#8217;s Service Directory to find your local pharmacy.\nSwelling is the start of healing. It&#8217;s normal to have swelling near the fracture. Often this will spread down to your fingers.\nThe swelling can change with:\n- your position\n- your activity\n- the time of day\nIt&#8217;s normal to have some swelling even after your fracture has healed. This can last for several months.\nThere&#8217;s usually a bony lump at the fracture site. This may reduce slightly with time.\nYou may notice that your knuckle is not as prominent because it&#8217;s common for the bone to shorten as a result of this injury.\nHaving a lot of swelling can become uncomfortable or limit your movement. However, there are some things you can do to help reduce the swelling. You can:\n- raise your arm above your heart when you&#8217;re resting &#8211; you can do this by supporting it with pillows\n- keep the other joints in your arm and hand moving normally\n- avoid too much rest or too much activity\n- massage the swelling from the tips of the fingers towards the armpit\nIt&#8217;s normal to have bruising. Bruising can be widespread and may appear a long way from your fracture.\nBruising can be very purple to start with and may change colour as you recover. Usually, you&#8217;ll see it between the web spaces of your fingers.\nIn general, you should pace yourself when it comes to getting back to normal. Only do activities as you feel able.\nYou should contact your insurance provider before driving as your injury may affect your insurance.\nOnce you&#8217;re out of your splint, the general advice is that you must be able to safely perform an emergency stop or manoeuvre.\nYou should always be in full control of your vehicle.\nYour return to work will depend on the type of work you do and your employer. It may be possible to discuss a phased return to work or changed duties.\nYou don’t need to see a healthcare professional to return to work.\nKeep doing any activities you&#8217;re able to, as your pain allows. Over time, gradually increase what you do.\nReduced flexibility and strength may make things more difficult to start with. This will get better as you slowly build up to all your usual activities.\nFrustration or low mood after your injury is normal. As you get back to normal life this will get better. If this is a major issue discuss it with your GP.\nLoss of confidence is common after a fracture. Get advice on:\n- preventing falls\n- 6 exercises for staying steady\nYou may be sent a letter inviting you for a scan of your bone density after a fracture.\nIt&#8217;s routine to be assessed for any further risk of fracture, especially if you:\n- are over the age of 50\n- have increased risk factors for fracture\nThere are things you can do to help your recovery after a metacarpal fracture.\nYou may have one finger taped to another (buddy taped) but try to move the joints that are taped as far as you&#8217;re able.\nJust after your injury, you should:\n- manage your pain and swelling\n- use your hand for light activities\n- avoid heavy lifting\n- avoid picking up hot items\nBetween 2 to 6 weeks after your injury, buddy taping should be removed.\nAt this time, you should:\n- continue to increase your movement with exercises for your injured hand\n- try and move the 3 hinged joints in each finger hourly but don&#8217;t force the movement\n- practice using the base of the thumb joint to roll and touch the fingers\n- gradually increase the use of your hand in normal daily activities\nAt 6 to 12 weeks after your injury, you should:\n- return to full function\n- resume normal day to day activity\nIf you&#8217;re a boxer, check with your doctor before starting any boxing. It can take closer to 3 months before you&#8217;ll be able to do any higher impact activity.\nYou can follow some exercises for your injured hand.\nTry and do exercises regularly throughout the day, ideally every hour.\nThe exercises should be started 2 to 6 weeks after your fracture.\n50\n37\n37\n54\n51\n1:02\n1:01\n1:00\nStop these exercises if they make your symptoms worse, or cause new pain.\nIf your wrist, hand or finger problem hasn’t improved within 6 weeks of following this advice, it’s a good idea to talk to a healthcare professional about your symptoms."

It causes inflammation (redness and swelling) and a build-up of fluid behind the eardrum.\nAnyone can develop a middle ear infection, but they&#8217;re most common in young children.\nYou do not always need to see a GP as most ear infections get better on their own within 3 to 5 days.\nThe main symptoms of a middle ear infection include:\n- earache\n- a high temperature (fever)\n- being sick\n- a lack of energy\n- slight hearing loss – if the middle ear becomes filled with fluid\nIn some cases, a hole may develop in the eardrum (perforated eardrum) and pus may run out of the ear. The earache, which is caused by the build-up of fluid stretching the eardrum, then resolves.\nYoung children and babies with an ear infection may also:\n- rub or pull their ear\n- not react to some sounds\n- be irritable or restless\n- be off their food\n- keep losing their balance\nYou or your child has:\nIf your GP practice is closed, phone 111.\nMost ear infections get better on their own within 3 to 5 days and do not need any specific treatment.\nIf needed, paracetamol or ibuprofen can be used to relieve pain and a high temperature. Always read the leaflet that comes with your medicine before taking it. Follow the recommended dosage instructions. If you’re not sure which treatments are suitable for you or your child, speak to a pharmacist for advice.\nPlacing a warm cloth over the affected ear may also help relieve pain.\nAntibiotics are not usually used to treat middle ear infections.\nMost middle ear infections occur when an infection, such as a cold, leads to a build-up of mucus in the middle ear. This causes the Eustachian tube (a thin tube that runs from the middle ear to the back of the nose) to become swollen or blocked. The mucus can’t drain away properly, making it easier for an infection to spread into the middle ear.\nAn enlarged adenoid (soft tissue at the back of the throat) can also block the Eustachian tube. The adenoid can be removed if it often causes ear infections.\nMiddle ear infections are more common in younger children because:\n- the Eustachian tube is smaller in children than in adults\n- a child’s adenoids are relatively larger than an adults\nCertain conditions can also increase the risk of middle ear infections, including:\n- having a cleft palate\n- having Down’s syndrome\nIt’s not possible to prevent middle ear infections. There are some things you can do that may reduce your child’s risk of developing one.\nChildren who go to nursery or school can pick up infections from other children who are unwell.\nComplications of middle ear infections are fairly rare, but can be serious.\nMost complications are the result of the infection spreading to another part of the ear or head. Rarely, infections can leave a perforation or hole in the eardrum.\nIf complications do develop, they often need to be treated immediately with antibiotics in hospital."

You should be assessed by a doctor as soon as possible.&nbsp;\nRead about migraine prevention and treatment\nThere are different types of migraine, including:\n- migraine with aura – where there are warning signs before the migraine attack begins, like seeing flashing lights\n- migraine without aura – the most common type, where the migraine attack occurs without warning signs\n- migraine aura without headache, also known as silent migraine – where an aura or other migraine symptoms are experienced, without a headache\nThe main symptom of migraine is usually an intense headache on one side of the head. In some cases, the pain can occur on both sides of your head and may affect your face or neck.\nThe pain might get worse when you move and may stop you from carrying out normal activities.\nOther symptoms associated with migraine include:\n- nausea\n- vomiting\n- increased sensitivity to light and sound – which is why many people with a migraine headache want to rest in a quiet, dark room\n- sweating\n- poor concentration\n- feeling very hot or very cold\n- abdominal (tummy) pain\n- diarrhoea\n- dizziness (light headedness)\nNot everyone with migraine experiences all of these symptoms. Some people may experience them without having a headache.\nThe symptoms of a migraine attack usually last between 4 hours and 3 days. You may feel very tired for up to a week afterwards.\nAbout 1 in 3 people with migraine have temporary warning symptoms, known as aura, before a migraine. These include:\n- visual problems – like seeing flashing lights, zig-zag patterns or blind spots\n- numbness or a tingling sensation like pins and needles – which usually starts in one hand and moves up your arm before affecting your face, lips and tongue\n- difficulty speaking\n- feeling dizzy or off balance\n- loss of consciousness – although this is unusual\nAura symptoms typically develop over the course of about 5 minutes and last for up to an hour. The aura might start before the headache or you might experience it at the same time as a headache. Some people may experience aura followed by only a mild headache or no headache at all.\nThe exact cause of migraine is unknown. It’s thought to be the result of abnormal brain activity temporarily affecting nerve signals, chemicals and blood vessels in the brain.\nAround half of all people who have migraine have a close relative with the condition. This suggests that genes may play a role.\nIt may help to keep a diary to see if you can identify a consistent trigger. It can be difficult to tell if something is a trigger or if what you&#8217;re experiencing is an early symptom of a migraine attack.\nThere might not always be a trigger for your headache.\nPossible migraine triggers include:\n- hormonal changes\n- starting your period\n- emotional triggers like anxiety, depression and stress\n- physical triggers like tiredness, poor posture, neck or shoulder tension and jet lag\n- fasting or low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)\n- strenuous exercise, if you’re not used to it\n- dietary triggers like alcohol, caffeine, chocolate or citrus fruit\n- dehydration\n- environmental triggers like bright lights, flickering screens, smoking or smoky rooms, loud noises, strong smells or changes in the weather\nMedication can also trigger migraine attacks. For example medication like some types of sleeping tablets, the combined contraceptive pill or hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Speak to your GP if you start to experience migraine attacks after starting to take a new medication.\nSome people crave chocolate before a migraine begins. This can be a sign that you’re about to have a migraine attack rather than the chocolate being the trigger for the migraine.\nThere’s no specific test to diagnose migraine. Your GP must identify a pattern of recurring headaches along with the associated symptoms.\nMigraine headaches can be unpredictable, sometimes occurring without the other symptoms. Getting an accurate diagnosis can take time.\nYour GP might do a physical examination and check your vision, co-ordination, reflexes and sensations. These will help rule out some other possible underlying causes of your symptoms.\nYour GP may ask if your headaches are:\n- on one side of the head\n- a pulsating pain\n- severe enough to prevent you carrying out daily activities\n- made worse by physical activity or moving about\n- accompanied by nausea and vomiting\n- accompanied by sensitivity to light and noise\nTo help with the diagnosis, it can be useful to keep a diary of your migraine attacks for a few weeks.\nNote down details including:\n- the date\n- time\n- what you were doing when the migraine attack began\n- how long the attack lasted\n- what symptoms you experienced\n- what medication you took (if any)\nTaking too many painkillers can make migraine difficult to treat. This condition is called medication overuse headache.\nKeep a record of what painkillers you take and how often you take them. You shouldn’t take painkillers on more than 10 days every month in the long-term.\nIt can be helpful to make a note when your start your period, if you have one. This can help your GP identify potential triggers.\nRead more about keeping a migraine diary on The Migraine Trust website.\nYour GP may decide to refer you to a neurologist (a specialist in conditions affecting the brain and nervous system). They’ll do further assessments and offer treatment if:\n- a diagnosis is unclear\n- you experience significant migraine headaches that aren&#8217;t being controlled by your current treatment\nRead about the prevention and treatment of migraine\nMigraine is linked to a small increased risk of other conditions like:\n- stroke\n- depression\n- bipolar disorder\n- anxiety disorder\n- panic disorder\nThe risk of having an ischaemic stroke is increased by the use of the combined contraceptive pill. Medical professionals generally advise women who experience migraine with aura not to use the combined contraceptive pill.\nWomen who have migraine without aura can usually take the combined contraceptive pill safely, unless they have other stroke risk factors like high blood pressure or a family history of cardiovascular disease.\nTalk to your GP about alternative forms of contraception if you experience aura symptoms and are taking the combined contraceptive pill."

Sometimes a minor head injury can cause concussion, but this is not always the case.\nIt can be hard to tell the difference between a minor and a severe head injury.\nRead about severe head injuries\nMinor head injuries often cause a bump or bruise. Other symptoms of a minor head injury may include:\n- a mild headache\n- nausea (feeling sick)\n- dizziness\n- blurred vision\nMost people who go to hospital with a minor head injury can return home shortly afterwards. They should make a full recovery within a few days.\nThere are some things you can do to manage minor head injuries at home. You should:\n- have someone stay with you for 24 hours after the injury to watch for serious symptoms appearing\n- get plenty of rest\n- avoid stressful or noisy situations\n- limit screen time (including smartphones)\n- take paracetamol or ibuprofen to help with mild pain, following all instructions on the packaging\n- use a cold compress (like a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel) to help soothe the injury\n- keep children with a head injury calm, and encourage them to avoid rough play\nIt&#8217;s also recommended that you:\n- avoid alcohol or recreational drugs\n- avoid sleeping pills, sedatives or tranquillisers (unless prescribed by a medical professional)\n- use a barrier (like a tea towel) between a cold compress and your skin\n- avoid using a cold compress for longer than 30 minutes, or more often than every 2 hours\n- avoid playing contact sports for at least 3 weeks, and follow return to sport guidelines\n- avoid returning to work or school until you feel able, as it may increase your recovery period\n- avoid driving a car, motorbike, bicycle, or operating machinery, until you have no symptoms that affect your ability to see or think\nIf your child has a minor head injury, they may cry or be distressed. This is normal – with attention and reassurance most children will settle down. However, seek medical help if your child continues to be distressed despite simple measures like pain relief.\nRead more about returning to sports after a head injury\nInjuries cannot be completely avoided, but there are some steps you can take to help reduce the risk of more serious injury. You could:\n- wear a helmet that fits well when doing activities like cycling\n- wear safety equipment when playing contact sports\n- clear up any spillages quickly to avoid someone slipping\n- use safety equipment if you’re doing any kind of DIY\n- fit safety gates at the top and bottom of stairs for young children\n- follow health and safety guidance at work"

        "description": "A miscarriage is the loss of a pregnancy before 24 weeks.\nAbout 1 in 5 pregnancies miscarry. Since many miscarriages aren’t recorded the figure might be higher.\nFor many people who have a pregnancy or baby loss, the word ‘miscarriage’ doesn&#8217;t properly express the impact of their loss.\nMiscarriage symptoms can be varied. Some people have very clear symptoms, while others may experience none at all.\nMiscarriage signs can change, depending on whether you&#8217;re having an early miscarriage or a late miscarriage.\nBefore 12 weeks, contact your GP or your local early pregnancy unit. If your GP is closed, phone 111.\n12 weeks or after, contact your local maternity service. If you&rsquo;re not registered with the maternity service, contact your GP or NHS 24 on 111.\nAn early miscarriage happens in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Most women who miscarry do so in the first 12 weeks of their pregnancy.\nMany women have a miscarriage before they even know they’re pregnant.

        "disease": "Molar pregnancy",
        "description": "A molar pregnancy happens when a fertilised egg has too much, or too little, genetic material. Because of this, the egg cannot develop into a baby.\nMolar pregnancies are very rare. Only 1 in 600 pregnancies will be a molar pregnancy.\nThere are 2 main types of molar pregnancy.\nA complete mole is a fertilised egg that has too little genetic material inside it.\nThis usually happens when a single sperm fertilises an ‘empty’ egg. Because this egg has no genetic material inside, a baby cannot develop. Instead, clusters of abnormal cells will develop in your womb. This is called molar tissue.\nA complete molar pregnancy will cause a positive pregnancy test and pregnancy symptoms. This is because of the molar tissue.\nA partial mole is a fertilised egg that has too much genetic material inside. This can happen because:\n- 2 sperm have fertilised a normal egg\n- an egg had double the normal amount of genetic material before being fertilised\nBecause there&#8217;s too much genetic material, a baby cannot fully develop from a partial mole. Instead, clusters of abnormal cells (called molar tissue) grow in the uterus (womb). Sometimes, a baby may be seen during an ultrasound scan. The baby will be smaller than expected, and cannot survive to full term.\nEven if you cannot see a baby on an ultrasound scan, the molar tissue will cause a positive pregnancy test. You&#8217;ll also experience pregnancy symptoms.\nOften, you won&#8217;t have any specific symptoms of a molar pregnancy. Some people do experience:\n- vaginal bleeding\n- a dark discharge from the vagina that contains small, grape-like lumps\n- severe morning sickness\n- a high temperature\n- an unusually swollen tummy\n- high blood pressure\n- protein in your pee, which might make your pee foamy, frothy or bubbly\n- tiredness\n- weakness\n- twitching or trembling\n- stomach pain\nThese symptoms can be normal in pregnancy. Having them does not mean there&#8217;s definitely a problem with your baby. However, you should contact your local early pregnancy unit who can check you over.\nMost molar pregnancies are identified from the results of your routine ultrasound scans. The images in the scan will look unusual. This is not enough to be certain that you&#8217;re experiencing a molar pregnancy. You&#8217;ll be offered a blood test to confirm.\nSometimes, a molar pregnancy causes an early miscarriage before it&#8217;s diagnosed. In this case, you&#8217;d only find out that it was a molar pregnancy if tests are done after miscarriage.\nMolar pregnancies are caused by problems with the genetic information in an egg or sperm. It&#8217;s not known what causes the problems with genetic information.\nThere are some factors that can increase the risk of molar pregnancy. You&#8217;re more likely to have a molar pregnancy if:\n- you&#8217;re a young person (under 18 years)\n- you&#8217;re over 45 years old\n- you&#8217;re of Asian origin\n- you&#8217;ve had a molar pregnancy before\n- you have a diet that is low in vitamin A\nEven if you fit into several of these categories, it&#8217;s most likely that you&#8217;ll not have a molar pregnancy. It&#8217;s still a rare condition. You&#8217;re just a little more likely to have a molar pregnancy than those who do not fit into these categories.\nA molar pregnancy cannot develop into a baby. There&#8217;s no way to correct the amount of genetic material in the fertilised egg. This means you&#8217;ll need to have surgery to have the pregnancy removed.\nSome people develop a gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) after a molar pregnancy. This is a rare, but highly curable, form of cancer.\nAfter your surgery, you&#8217;ll be registered with the Hydatidiform mole follow-up centre. This centre is within Ninewells hospital in Dundee. They&#8217;ll provide follow up appointments and monitor you for signs of GTN. They do this by checking the level of hCG (a pregnancy hormone) in your blood and urine (pee).\nThe centre will work with your local GP to do the blood and urine tests. You&#8217;ll not need to travel to Dundee to have these tests done.\nIt&#8217;s important that you do not become pregnant again before finishing follow-up treatment. A new pregnancy will cause your hCG levels to rise. This means the specialists cannot tell if you&#8217;ve developed GTN.\nGTN is very curable type of cancer. It can be caused by the molar tissue growing in your uterus.\nOver 99% of people with GTN make a full recovery.\nGTN is usually diagnosed because specialists detect high hCG in your blood or urine (pee). Unusual vaginal bleeding can also be a sign of GTN.\nThese specialists will discuss treatment options with you. You may be offered:\n- surgery to remove the tissue\n- chemotherapy\nIf you have GTN, you should not become pregnant for a year after finishing chemotherapy. This is because, in rare cases, the GTN could come back.\nHaving a molar pregnancy should not stop you from getting pregnant again.\nIf you&#8217;ve had a molar pregnancy before, the risk of you having another is higher than a person who has never had one. But this risk is very small. Only 1 in 80 people who&#8217;ve had a molar pregnancy will have another.\nExperiencing a molar pregnancy can be a difficult time emotionally. You may grieve for your lost baby, and feel frustration because no one can explain why this happened.\nYou may also feel anxious about GTN, especially as you wait for your follow up treatment to finish.\nRead more about coping after losing a baby"

        "disease": "Motor neurone disease (MND)",
        "description": "Motor neurone disease (MND) is a rare condition that progressively damages parts of the nervous system. This leads to muscle weakness, often with visible wasting.\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common form of MND.\nMND happens when specialist nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, called motor neurones, stop working properly and die prematurely. This is known as neurodegeneration.\nMotor neurones control muscle activity like:\n- gripping\n- walking\n- speaking\n- swallowing\n- breathing\nAs MND progresses, it can become more difficult to do some or all of these activities.\nThe symptoms of MND start gradually over weeks and months. They tend to appear on one side of the body first and get progressively worse.\nBeing referred to a specialist as early as possible can help you access the right support.\nThere are usually 3 stages of symptoms.\nSometimes the early symptoms are mistaken for similar conditions that also affect the nervous system.\nIn about two-thirds of people with MND, the first symptoms are in the arm or leg. This is sometimes called limb-onset disease. The symptoms include:\n- a weakened grip, which can cause problems picking up or holding objects\n- weakness at the shoulder, making lifting your arm above your head difficult\n- tripping up over your foot because of weakness at your ankle or hip\nThese symptoms are usually painless. You might also experience widespread twitching of the muscles (fasciculations) or muscle cramps. You might also see wasting of the muscles with significant weight loss.\nIn 1 out of 4 cases, the first MND symptoms will affect the muscles used for speaking and swallowing.\nThese problems might initially affect the muscles used for speech and swallowing. Increasingly slurred speech (dysarthria) is usually the first sign of this type of MND. It might be misdiagnosed as a stroke.\nAs the condition progresses, it may become increasingly difficult to swallow (dysphagia). This might be misdiagnosed as a blockage in the throat.\nIn rare cases, MND starts by affecting the lungs, rather than affecting them at the end of the condition. This is called respiratory-onset disease.\nIn some cases the initial symptoms like breathing difficulties and shortness of breath are more obvious.\nYou might suffer from a lack of sleep and a headache in the morning. This might be because your body isn&#8217;t getting rid of the carbon dioxide you normally breathe out.\nAs MND becomes more advanced, more parts and functions of the body are affected. This can make you more likely to experience infections, like chest infections, which can cause your condition to get worse quicker.\nThe limbs will become weaker. The muscles in the limbs may become thinner. As a result, the person will find it increasingly difficult to move the affected limbs.\nThe limbs may also become stiff. This is known as spasticity. Both muscle wasting and stiffness can also cause joint aches and pains.\nSpeaking and swallowing can become increasingly difficult as MND progresses.\nChoking episodes can be distressing but they aren&#8217;t usually the cause of death.\nReduced swallowing can cause excess saliva. This can cause drooling. Thicker saliva can sometimes be difficult to clear from the chest or throat. This is because the muscles that control coughing become weak.\nSome people with MND have episodes of uncontrollable excessive yawning. This can happen even when they&#8217;re not tired. It can sometimes cause jaw pain.\nMND can cause changes in your ability to control your emotions. This is more likely when there&#8217;s weakness in the muscles that control speech and swallowing.\nOne of the most common signs is when a person has episodes of sudden uncontrollable crying or, more rarely, laughter. This is sometimes called emotional lability or emotionality.\nSometimes, people with MND have significant difficulties with:\n- concentration\n- planning\n- communication\n- behavioural changes.\nThis is where the condition is causing a type of dementia (usually frontotemporal dementia).\nUp to 15% of people with MND develop more profound frontotemporal dementia. This usually happens soon after, or sometimes before, their first muscle-related symptoms. Someone with MND might not be aware that there are problems with their behaviour or personality.\nBreathing might become less efficient as the nerves and muscles that help control the lungs become more damaged.\nThis might mean you feel short of breath after doing every day tasks like walking up the stairs. Over time, you might become even more out of breath when you&#8217;re resting.\nShortness of breath can become a problem at night. Some people find it difficult to breathe when they&#8217;re lying down. Others might wake in the night because they feel breathless.\nAs breathlessness increases, breathing support can help reduce this symptom. This is usually given by non-invasive ventilatory (NIV) support. It can be useful at night to improve your sleep quality. This can help reduce drowsiness during the day.\nAs MND progresses to its final phase, you might experience:\n- increasing body paralysis, which means you&#8217;ll need help with most daily activities\n- significant shortness of breath\nEventually, non-invasive breathing assistance won&#8217;t be enough to make up for the loss of normal lung function. At this stage, more medication can help to reduce symptoms of breathlessness and anxiety related to it. Most people with MND become increasingly drowsy before falling into a deep sleep, where they usually die peacefully.\nSome people with MND have other symptoms that aren&#8217;t directly caused by the condition, but are related to the stress of living with it. These might include depression, insomnia and anxiety.\nMND occurs when specialist nerve cells (motor neurones) in the brain and spinal cord progressively fail. It&#8217;s not clear why this happens.\nOne known cause of MND is an error in your genes with 20% of cases linked to genetic causes.&nbsp;Half of genetic cases&nbsp;will be in people who have a family history of MND. The other half of genetic cases will occur in those without a family history.\nHaving a family history of frontotemporal dementia can also increase the risk of inheriting MND.\nThe error in the gene affects the cells ability to perform normally and survive.\nIf you have a genetic form of MND, there&#8217;s a chance that you could pass the risk of developing MND on to your child. The risk of them developing the condition can be affected by many factors like age.\nNot everyone who has the genetic mutation will develop MND in their lifetime. Typically, the longer you live, the more likely you are to develop the condition.\nIf you have a parent with MND with no other family history of the disease, you&#8217;re at a slight increased risk of MND of about 1.4%. The risk to the general population of MND is about 0.3%.\nIt&#8217;s unclear why the motor neurones begin to lose function. Most experts believe that it&#8217;s a combination of factors that affect either the motor neurones or the cells that support them. There are some theories involving different cell processes including:\nAggregates are abnormal clumps of protein that develop inside motor neurones. They&#8217;re found in nearly all cases of MND and may disrupt the normal working of the motor neurones. It can also be a marker that the cell is under stress.\nThe protein TDP-43 is most commonly found in these aggregates. This is a protein involved in the processing of the genetic instructions for the cell through a molecule known as RNA. Mutations in the gene (TARDBP) coding for this protein can be a cause of genetic cases of MND.\nAll cells have transport systems that move nutrients and other chemicals into the cell and waste products out of the cell. Research suggests that the transport systems in motor neurones become disrupted. Over time, toxic waste can build up in cells as a natural by-product of normal cell activity and aging.\nThe body gets rid of the toxic waste by waste disposal systems that can be affected by ageing and the environment.\nGlial cells surround and support motor neurones and provide them with nutrients.\nWhen they don&#8217;t work properly the motor neurones no longer receive the support and nutrition they need to function normally.\nTheir involvement in MND is still being researched.\nNerve cells use special &#8220;messenger chemicals&#8221; called neurotransmitters to pass information between cells. One of the neurotransmitters is called glutamate. It excites neurones and one theory is that too much activity through this causes damage to the neurones.\nRiluzole, a drug used to treat MND reduces the level of neuronal activity by blocking the action of Glutamate.\nMitochondria are the &#8220;batteries&#8221; of cells. They provide the energy that a cell needs to carry out its normal function. Mitochondria in the motor neurones of people with MND might not function properly.\nSpeak to your GP if you experience the initial symptoms of MND.\nAfter hearing about your symptoms and an initial exam, your GP might refer you to a neurologist (a doctor who specialises in conditions affecting the brain and nervous system).\nDiagnosing MND can be difficult during the early stages. This is because many of the first symptoms can be caused by other more common health conditions like:\n- a trapped nerve – wear and tear of the bones in the spine can sometimes cause nerves to become trapped under the spine\n- peripheral neuropathy – where part of the nervous system is damaged by another condition, like type 2 diabetes\n- swallowing difficulties caused by narrowing or inflammation of the gullet\n- speech difficulties due to problems with the voice box\n- damage to the brain by stroke or other neurological conditions like multiple sclerosis (MS) in younger people\nMND is usually diagnosed by a neurologist based on the symptoms and a physical examination.\nThere&#8217;s no single test for MND. Various tests might be used to rule out other possible causes of the your symptoms. Tests might include:\n- blood tests – these can be used for several reasons, like checking that organs are working, or to look for a marker of muscle damage (creatinine kinase)\n- magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan – to give a detailed picture of your brain and spinal cord\n- electromyography (EMG) – measures the electrical activity in your muscles, which shows how well your motor neurones are working and connecting to the muscles\n- nerve conduction test – similar to an EMG but measures how quickly your nerves can conduct an electrical signal\n- lumbar puncture – a sample of spinal fluid might be tested to exclude an inflammatory or nerve condition caused by an infection\n- muscle biopsy – in rare cases, a small sample of muscle might be removed for testing to determine whether the problem lies in the muscles\nGene tests can be used to support the diagnosis in some individuals. They might provide an explanation of why they&#8217;ve developed the disorder. Your GP can give you more information about specialists who can help with genetic testing.\nThere are many reasons why there may be delays in diagnosis. The initial symptoms might not appear to be serious. Or symptoms might not be recognised as being related to the nervous system so a neurologist isn&#8217;t consulted at first.\nSometimes, the diagnosis of MND is clear without the need for further tests. Confirming a diagnosis can sometimes be time-consuming even for an experienced neurologist. They might need a period of observation to be sure, particularly in cases where the condition progresses slowly. MND can only be diagnosed if the symptoms are clearly getting worse (progressive).\nBeing told you have MND can be devastating and the news can be difficult to take in at first.\nAfter you&#8217;re diagnosed you should be provided with contact details of an MND care specialist. These are healthcare professionals with specialist experience caring for people with MND. They&#8217;ll be able to give you (and your family) extra support after the diagnosis and during your time with the illness.\nTalking to a counsellor or a trained clinical psychologist might help with feelings of depression and anxiety.\nIt&#8217;s not unusual to have thoughts of taking your own life, although very few people with MND go on to do this. You should discuss these thoughts with your doctor.\nTaking antidepressants or medicines to reduce anxiety may help. Your care team will be able to tell you about this.\nAlthough there&#8217;s no cure for MND, there are treatments available to help relieve the symptoms.\nA team of healthcare professionals will work together to help care for you. This multidisciplinary team typically includes:\n- a neurologist and an MND care specialist\n- a specialist in breathing (respiratory specialist)\n- physiotherapists to advise on mobility aids\n- occupational therapists to assess the need for adaptations to living environments\n- speech and language therapist to provide help with communication and swallowing\n- dieticians to support nutrition\nAs the conditions advances, you might also need palliative care.\nRiluzole is the only licensed medication in the UK that&#8217;s shown a survival benefit for people with MND. Riluzole is thought to slow down the damage to the motor neurone cells by reducing their sensitivity to the nerve transmitter glutamate.\nIn medical research, riluzole extended survival by 2 to 3 months on average.\nSide effects of riluzole are usually mild and can include nausea, tiredness and, less commonly, a rapid heartbeat.\nVery rarely, riluzole has been known to cause liver damage. If you&#8217;re prescribed riluzole you&#8217;ll need to have blood tests for the first few months to check your liver is working properly. If you&#8217;ve had significant liver disease, riluzole may not be suitable for you.\nThere are treatments available that can help relieve many of the symptoms of MND and improve your quality of life.\nPhysiotherapy can help muscle cramps. In some cases, a medication called quinine can help treat muscle cramps too. They often improve later in the condition.\nQuinine can cause side effects like:\n- hearing and vision problems\n- tinnitus – the perception of noise in one ear, both ears or inside the head\n- vertigo – a sensation that you, or the environment around you, is moving\nQuinine will usually only be used if the potential benefits are thought to outweigh the risks.\nMuscle stiffness, also known as spasticity, can be treated using medication like baclofen. This helps to help relax the muscles. Side effects can include increased weakness or tiredness.\nMedication is available to treat drooling of saliva. One option is a hyoscine hydrobromide skin patch.\nAlternative medicines used to control drooling include:\n- amitriptyline\n- atropine eye drops applied to the tongue\n- glycopyrronium\n- botulinum toxin injections into the glands that produce saliva\nNot everyone with MND will have significant speech problems.\nThere are ways to help people who find it hard to communicate. A speech and language therapist can teach you techniques to make your voice as clear as possible.\nAs the disease progresses, you may need assistive technology to help you communicate. A range of communication aids is available. Your therapist will be able to tell you about the most effective communication aids for you.\nNot everyone with MND will have significant swallowing problems (dysphagia). For those that do, it can prevent normal eating and drinking. This can lead to you feeling more tired. If food or fluid goes down the wrong way into the lungs it can cause chest infections (called aspiration).\nOne common treatment for dysphagia is a feeding tube known as a gastrostomy tube. The tube is surgically implanted into your stomach through a small cut on the surface of the stomach. It shouldn&#8217;t restrict your daily activities. You can continue to bathe and swim if you wish.\nIdeally you should have the tube inserted before you become too frail. This is so you can get the best out of it and to give yourself the best chance of recovering from the procedure.\nIf you have thick secretions (fluids) you can&#8217;t cough up yourself, medicine like carbocisteine and acetylcysteine might help.\nAs MND progresses, the muscles that help you breathe will become weaker. Your breathing will become increasingly shallow, with a weaker cough.\nBreathing difficulties usually develop gradually. They&#8217;re sometimes the first sign of MND, although this is rare.\nIt&#8217;s important to discuss breathing problems with your GP before they occur. Your GP or neurologist should be able to refer you to a respiratory (breathing) specialist or a palliative care specialist, depending on your needs.\nYou might benefit from non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) to support your breathing. Room air (not oxygen) is sucked into a small box. It&#8217;s filtered and then gently pumped into the lungs through a face mask or nasal tube each time you take a breath.\nNIV may not be suitable for everyone with MND. Your healthcare team will be able to discuss the options available to you.\nMany people with MND draw up an advance decision (sometimes called an advanced directive). This is where you decide your treatment preferences in advance in case you can&#8217;t communicate your decisions later because you&#8217;re too ill.\nIssues that can be covered by an advance decision include:\n- whether you want to be treated at home, in a hospice or in a hospital once you reach the final stages of MND\n- the type of medication you&#8217;d be willing to take in certain circumstances\n- whether you&#8217;d be willing to consider a feeding tube if you were no longer able to swallow food and liquid\n- if you have respiratory failure (loss of lung function), whether you wish to have artificial resuscitation, like having a permanent breathing tube inserted into your throat (known as a tracheostomy)\n- whether you&#8217;d be willing to donate any of your organs after you die (the brain and spinal cord of people with MND are very important for ongoing research)\nYour care team will be able to provide you with more information and advice about making an advance decision.\nRead more about end of life care\nYou might be given the opportunity to take part in research, including drug trials. Your MND care specialist and neurology consultant can provide further information on this.\nCaring for someone with MND can be both physically and emotionally demanding. It&#8217;s likely you&#8217;ll need a wide range of support.\nFor information and advice about all aspects of caring, visit Care Information Scotland"

        "disease": "Mouth cancer",
        "description": "Mouth cancer, also known as oral cancer, is where a tumour develops on the surface of the tongue, mouth, lips or gums.\nTumours&nbsp;can also occur in the salivary glands, tonsils and the pharynx (the part of the throat from your mouth to your windpipe) but these are less common.\nSymptoms of mouth cancer&nbsp;include:\n- red or white patches on the lining of your mouth or tongue\n- ulcers\n- a lump\nSpeak to your GP if these symptoms&nbsp;do not heal within 3 weeks, especially if you&#8217;re a heavy drinker or smoker.\nA cancer that develops on the inside or outside layer of the body is called a carcinoma and these types of cancer are categorised by the type of cells the cancer&nbsp;starts in.\nSquamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of mouth cancer, accounting for nine out of 10 cases. Squamous cells are found in many places around the body, including the inside of the mouth and under the skin.\nLess common types of mouth cancer include:\n- oral malignant melanoma – where the cancer starts in cells called melanocytes, which help give skin its colour\n- adenocarcinomas – cancers that develop inside the salivary glands\nMouth cancer occurs when something goes wrong with the normal cell lifecycle, causing them to grow and reproduce uncontrollably.\nRisk factors&nbsp;for developing mouth cancer include:\n- smoking or using products that contain tobacco\n- drinking alcohol – smokers who are also heavy drinkers have a much higher risk compared to the population at large\n- infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV), the virus that causes genital warts\nRead more about the causes of mouth cancer\nMouth cancer is an uncommon type of cancer.\nMost cases of mouth cancer first develop in older adults who are aged between 50&nbsp;and 74 years old.\nMouth cancer can occur in younger adults, but it&#8217;s thought that HPV infection may be responsible for the majority of cases that occur in younger people.\nMouth cancer is more common in men than in women. This is thought to be due to the fact that, on average, men drink more alcohol than women.\nThere are 3 main treatment options for mouth cancer. They are:\n- surgery – where the cancerous cells are surgically removed and, in some cases, some of the surrounding tissue\n- chemotherapy – where powerful medications are used to kill cancerous cells\n- radiotherapy – where high energy X-rays&nbsp;are used to kill cancerous cells\nThese treatments are often used in combination. For example, a course of radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be given after surgery to help prevent the cancer returning.\nRead more about treating mouth cancer\nBoth surgery and radiotherapy can make speaking and swallowing difficult (dysphagia).\nDysphagia can be a potentially serious problem. If small pieces of food enter your airways and become lodged in your lungs, it could trigger a chest infection, known as aspiration pneumonia.\nRead more about the complications of mouth cancer\nThe three most effective ways to prevent mouth cancer from developing – or prevent it reocurring after successful treatment – are:\n- not smoking\n- keeping to the recommended limits for alcohol consumption\n- eating a &#8216;Mediterranean-style diet&#8217;, with plenty of fresh vegetables (particularly tomatoes), citrus fruits, olive oil and fish (read more about healthy eating)\nIt&#8217;s also important that you have regular dental check-ups because dentists can often spot the early stages of mouth cancer.\nMouth cancer can develop on most parts of the mouth, including the lips, gums and occasionally, the throat.\nThe most common symptoms of mouth cancer include:\n- red or white patches in the mouth or throat\n- a lump\n- ulcers\nOther symptoms may include:\n- persistent pain in the mouth\n- pain or difficulty when swallowing (dysphagia)\n- changes in your voice, or speech problems\n- swollen lymph nodes (glands) in your neck\n- unexplained weight loss\n- bleeding or numbness in the mouth\n- a tooth, or teeth, that becomes loose for no obvious reason\n- difficulty moving your jaw\nMany of these symptoms can&nbsp;be caused by less serious conditions, such as minor infections.\nBut it&#8217;s strongly recommended that you visit your GP if any of these symptoms have lasted for more than 3 weeks. It&#8217;s especially important to seek medical advice if you&#8217;re a heavy drinker or smoker.\nMouth cancer tends not to cause any noticeable symptoms during the initial stages of the disease.\nThis is why it&#8217;s important to have regular dental check-ups, particularly if you are a smoker, a heavy drinker or a betel chewer, because a dentist may often be able to detect the condition during an examination.\nYou should have a dental check-up at least every year. However, more frequent check-ups may be recommended if you have a history of&nbsp;tooth decay or gum disease.\nThe 2 leading causes of mouth cancer in the UK are drinking too much alcohol and smoking.\nBoth alcohol and tobacco are carcinogenic, which means they contain chemicals that can damage the DNA in cells and lead to cancer.\nThe risk of mouth cancer increases significantly in somebody who is both a heavy smoker and heavy drinker.\nExactly what triggers the changes in DNA that lead to mouth cancer and why only a small number of people develop mouth cancer is still uncertain.\nThere are 2 ways mouth cancer can spread:\n- directly – the cancer can spread out of the mouth and into nearby tissues, such as surrounding skin or into the back of the jaw\n- via the lymphatic system –&nbsp;the lymphatic system is a series of glands&nbsp;found throughout your body which&nbsp;produce many specialised cells needed by your immune system to fight infection\nMouth cancer that spreads to another part of the body is known as metastatic oral cancer.\nOther&nbsp;risk factors for mouth cancer may&nbsp;include:\n- chewing tobacco or other smokeless tobacco products like snus\n- chewing&nbsp;betel nuts with or without tobacco\n- a poor diet\n- the human papilloma virus (HPV)\n- poor oral hygiene\nThere is a range of smokeless tobacco products including:\n- chewing tobacco\n- snuff – powdered tobacco designed to be snorted\n- snus – a type of smokeless tobacco popular in Sweden, which is placed under your upper lip\nSmokeless tobacco products are not harmless and may increase your risk of developing mouth cancer, as well as other cancers, such as liver cancer, pancreatic cancer and oesophageal cancer.\nBetel nuts are mildly addictive seeds taken from the betel palm tree, and are widely used in many southeast Asian ethnic communities, such as people of Indian and Sri Lankan origin.\nThey have a stimulant effect similar to coffee. Betel nuts also have a carcinogenic effect, which can increase the risk of mouth cancer. This risk is made worse as many people enjoy chewing betel nuts along with tobacco.\nDue to the tradition of using betel nuts, rates of mouth cancer are much higher in ethnic Indian and Sri Lankan communities than in the population at large.\nThere is evidence that a poor diet may increase your risk of some types of mouth cancer.\nA healthy, balanced diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables is thought to reduce your risk of developing mouth cancer.\nThe human papilloma virus (HPV) is a family of viruses that affect the skin and&nbsp;moist membranes that line your body, such as those in your cervix, anus, mouth and throat.\nYou can contract an HPV infection by having sexual contact with a person already infected – you do not have to have &#8216;full sex&#8217;; just close skin-to-skin contact.\nThere is evidence that in rare cases,&nbsp;certain types of HPV can cause abnormal tissue growth inside the mouth, triggering mouth cancer.\nThere is evidence that poor oral hygiene, such as having tooth decay, gum disease, not brushing your teeth regularly and having ill-fitted dentures (false teeth) can increase your risk of mouth cancer.\nIf you have symptoms of mouth cancer, your GP will carry out a physical examination and ask about your symptoms.\nIf mouth cancer is suspected, you will be referred to hospital for further tests or to speak to a specialist head and neck surgeon.\nIn 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of mouth cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected mouth cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral.\nIt may be necessary to remove a small sample of affected tissue to check for the presence of cancerous cells. This procedure is known as a biopsy.\nThere are 3 main methods used to carry out a biopsy in cases of suspected mouth cancer.\nA punch biopsy may be used if the suspected affected area of tissue is in an easily accessible place, such as your tongue or the inside of your mouth.\nThe area is first injected with a local anaesthetic to numb it. The doctor will then cut away a small section of affected tissue and remove it with tweezers.\nThe procedure is not painful, but can feel a little uncomfortable.\nA fine needle aspiration (FNA) is a type of biopsy used if it is suspected&nbsp;a swelling in your neck is the result of mouth cancer.\nYour neck is numbed and a&nbsp;needle is used&nbsp;to draw out a small sample of tissue and fluids from the lump. The sample is then&nbsp;checked for cancerous cells.\nFNA is not painful but&nbsp;it can be uncomfortable and cause bruising.\nA&nbsp;panendoscope is used if the suspected tissue is at the back of your throat or inside one of your nasal cavities.\nThis is a long thin tube&nbsp;with a&nbsp;camera and a light&nbsp;which&nbsp;is guided through&nbsp;the nose, then used to remove a small section of tissue for the biopsy.\nThe panendoscope can also check whether cancer has spread from your mouth to further down your throat, such as your larynx (voice box), oesophagus (gullet) or trachea (windpipe).\nIf the biopsy confirms cancer you will need further tests to check what stage it has reached.\nIf the cancer is diagnosed late it can have spread from your mouth into the lymphatic system – a series of glands throughout your body which produce many of the specialised cells needed by your immune system.\nOnce the cancer reaches the lymphatic system, it is capable of spreading to any other part of your body, including your bones, blood and organs.\nHowever, it&#8217;s uncommon for mouth cancer to spread further than the lymph nodes near your mouth, although in some cases it may also spread to surrounding bones, such as the jaw bone, and in some cases your lungs.\nTherefore, the tests will examine your lymph nodes, bones and the tissue near the site of your initial tumour to check for the presence of other tumours.\nThese tests may include:\n- an&nbsp;X-ray\n- a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan \n- a computerised tomography (CT) scan\n- a positron emission tomography (PET) scan\nFurther biopsies on nearby lymph nodes may also be carried out.\nOnce these tests have been completed it should be possible to tell what stage and grade your cancer is:\n- staging is a measure of how far the cancer has spread\n- the grade describes how aggressive the cancer is and how fast it is likely to spread in future\nThis will help determine whether you have:\n- early mouth cancer (usually curable)\n- intermediate mouth cancer (may be curable)\n- or advanced mouth cancer (not usually curable, but it is usually possible to slow the spread of the cancer and extend lifespan)\nThere are 3 grades of mouth cancer: low-grade (the slowest), moderate-grade and high-grade (the most aggressive).\nGrading your cancer helps the doctor decide how quickly you need to be treated. Read more about treating mouth cancer.\nYour treatment will depend on the type and size of the cancer, the grade and how far it&#8217;s spread – as well as your general health.\nIf the cancer hasn&#8217;t spread beyond the mouth or the oropharynx (the bit of your throat at the back of your mouth), a complete cure may be possible using a combination of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.\nIf the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, then a cure is unlikely but it will be possible to slow the progress of the cancer and help relieve symptoms by using surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.\nDeciding what treatment is best for you can be difficult. Your care team will make recommendations, but the final decision will be yours.\nBefore going to hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions to ask the specialist. For example, what are the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.\nRadiotherapy makes the teeth more sensitive and vulnerable to infection so before treatment begins, you&#8217;ll be given a full dental examination and any necessary work will be carried out.\nIf you smoke or drink, stopping will increase the chances of your treatment being successful.\nYour specialist nurse and your GP can provide help and support if you are finding it difficult to quit smoking and drinking.\nRead more about quitting smoking and cutting down on alcohol\nFor mouth cancer, the aim of surgical treatment is to remove any affected tissue while minimising damage to the rest of the mouth.\nIf the cancer is in its very early stages, it may be possible to remove any tumours using a type of laser surgery known as photodynamic therapy (PDT). PDT involves taking a medicine that makes your tissue sensitive to the effects of light. A laser is then used to remove the tumour.\nIf your cancer is more advanced, it may be necessary to remove part of your mouth lining and, in some cases, facial skin, which can be replaced using skin grafted from your forearm or chest.\nIf your tongue is affected, part of the tongue will have to be removed. This is known as a partial glossectomy. The tongue is then reconstructed using grafted tissue.\nIf the cancer has spread to your jawbone it will need to be surgically removed. The jawbone can be replaced by taking bone from another part of your body and grafting it in place.\nOccasionally, other bones, such as cheekbones, may have to be removed to completely remove the cancer.\nThese can be replaced with plastic prosthetic bones which are usually very realistic, leaving your physical appearance largely unaffected.\nDuring surgery, your surgeon may also remove lymph nodes near the site of the initial tumour. This is often done as a preventative measure in case they contain small numbers of cancerous cells that can&#8217;t be detected.\nRadiotherapy uses doses of radiation to kill cancerous cells. It may be possible to remove the cancer using radiotherapy alone, but it is usually used after surgery to prevent the cancer from reocurring.\nThe treatment is normally given every day over the course of three to seven weeks, depending on the size of the cancer and how far it has spread.\nWhile it kills cancerous cells, radiotherapy can also affect healthy tissue, and it has a number of side effects, including:\n- sore, red skin (like sunburn)\n- mouth ulcers&nbsp;\n- sore mouth and throat\n- dry mouth\n- loss of, or changes in taste\n- loss of appetite\n- tiredness&nbsp;\n- feeling sick\n- stiff jaw\n- bad breath&nbsp;\nAny side effects will be monitored by your care team and treated where possible.\nThe side effects of radiotherapy can be distressing, but most of them will pass once the radiotherapy is complete.\nInternal radiotherapy – also called brachytherapy – is often used to treat cancers of the tongue that are in their early stages. It involves placing radioactive implants directly into the tumour while you are under a general anaesthetic.\nThey will be left for between 1 and 8 days during which time the cancer cells will receive a much higher dose of radiation than the rest of your mouth.\nVisits by friends and family will need to be restricted due to radiation and pregnant women and children won&#8217;t be able to visit you.\nThe radioactive implants will cause your mouth to become swollen, and you will experience some pain 5 to 10 days after the implants are removed.\nChemotherapy is sometimes used in combination with radiotherapy when the cancer is widespread, or if it is thought there is a significant risk of the cancer returning.\nChemotherapy involves the use of powerful cancer-killing medicines. These medicines damage the DNA of the cancerous cells, interrupting their ability to reproduce.\nMedicines used in chemotherapy can sometimes damage healthy tissue as well as the cancerous tissue. Adverse side effects are common and include:\n- fatigue (tiredness)\n- sore mouth\n- mouth ulcers\n- feeling sick\n- being sick \n- hair loss\n- tiredness\nThe side effects should stop once the treatment has finished.\nChemotherapy also weakens your immune system and makes you more vulnerable to infection.\nCetuximab is a new type of medication, known as a biologic, used to treat advanced cases of mouth cancer. It is usually used in combination with radiotherapy or chemotherapy.\nCetuximab targets proteins on the surface of cancer cells, known as epidermal growth factor receptors. These receptors help the cancer to grow, so by targeting these proteins, cetuximab prevents the cancer from spreading.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) ruled that cetuximab did not represent a cost-effective treatment in most cases and has recommended it only be used in people who:\n- are in a good state of health (likely to make a good recovery if treated)\n- are unable to have chemotherapy for medical reasons (for example, because they have kidney disease or are pregnant)\nComplications of treatment for mouth cancer can include dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), speech problems and emotional disruption.\nDysphagia&nbsp;is the medical term for difficulty swallowing. It&#8217;s easy to take your ability to swallow food and liquid&nbsp;for granted,&nbsp;but in reality, the process relies on a complex interaction of muscles, which can be easily disrupted.\nSurgery and&nbsp;radiotherapy can affect your tongue, mouth or throat, resulting in dysphagia. Dysphagia is a potentially serious problem because, aside from the risk of malnutrition, there is a chance that small particles of food could enter your airways and become lodged in your lungs. This can trigger a chest infection, known as aspiration pneumonia.&nbsp;\nIf you are having problems swallowing, a speech and language therapist (SLT) will need to assess your swallowing reflex. One way an SLT can do this is to perform a test known as a videofluoroscopy, which involves adding a special dye to liquid and food that you swallow. The dye highlights your swallowing reflexes and by using X-rays your SLT can see if there is a risk of food entering your lungs.\nIf this is the case, it may be necessary for the short term to provide you with a feeding tube, which will be directly connected to your stomach. The SLT will teach you exercises so you can &#8216;relearn&#8217; how to swallow properly.\nYour ability to swallow will improve as you learn the exercises and the damaged tissue is allowed to heal. However, there is a chance your swallowing reflex will never fully recover.\nIn some circumstances, you may have to alter your diet to make swallowing easier. A&nbsp;dietitian can give you dietary advice.\nRead more detailed information about how dysphagia is&nbsp;treated\nMuch like swallowing, your ability to speak clearly is governed by a complex interaction of muscles, bones and tissue, including your tongue, teeth, lips and soft palate (a section of tissue found at the back of the mouth).\nRadiotherapy and surgery can affect this process and make it difficult to pronounce certain sounds. In severe cases, you may have problems making yourself understood.\nAn SLT will help you improve your verbal communication skills by teaching you a series of exercises that develop your range of vocal movements and teach you new ways of producing sounds.\nThe emotional impact of living with mouth cancer can be significant. Many people report experiencing a roller coaster effect.\nFor example, you may feel down when you receive a diagnosis, but feel up when&nbsp;the cancer responds to treatment.&nbsp;Then you may feel down again as you try to come to terms with the side effects and after effects of your treatment.\nThis type of emotional disruption can sometimes trigger depression. Signs that you may be depressed include:\n- feeling down or hopeless during the past month\n- no longer taking pleasure in the things you used to enjoy\nContact your GP for advice if you think&nbsp;you may be depressed. There are a range of effective treatments for depression, including antidepressant medication and talking therapies, such as&nbsp;cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).\nRead more about&nbsp;depression and coping with cancer\nHaving mouth cancer doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean you&#8217;ll have to give up work, but you may need quite a lot of time off, and you may not be able to carry on as you did before treatment.\nIf you have cancer you&#8217;re covered by the Equality Act. This means that your employer is not allowed to discriminate against you because of your illness. They have a duty to make &#8216;reasonable adjustments&#8217; to help you cope. Examples of these include:\n- allowing you time off for treatment and medical appointments\n- allowing flexibility with working hours, the tasks you have to perform or your working environment\nThe definition of what is &#8216;reasonable&#8217; depends on the situation. For example, how much it would affect your employer’s business.\nIt will help if you give your employer as much information as possible about how much time you will need off and when. Talk to your human resources department if you have one. Your union or staff association representative should also be able to give you advice.\nIf you&#8217;re having difficulties with your employer, you may be able to receive help from your union or your local Citizens Advice Scotland.\nIt is not always easy to talk about cancer, either for you or your family and friends. You may sense that some people feel awkward around you or avoid you. Being open about how you feel and what your family and friends can do to help may put them at ease. Do not feel shy about telling them that you need some time to yourself, if that is what you need.\nIf you have to stop work or go part-time because of your cancer, you may find it hard to cope financially. If you have cancer or you are caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to financial support:\n- if you have a job, but cannot work because of your illness, you are entitled to Statutory Sick Pay from your employer\n- if you don&#8217;t have a job and cannot work because of your illness, you may be entitled to Employment and Support Allowance\n- if you are caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to Carer’s Allowance\n- you may be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home or if you have a low household income\nFind out as early as possible what help is available to you. Speak to the social worker at your hospital who can give you the information you need.\nIf you have questions, your GP or nurse may be able to reassure you. You may find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor or psychologist, or to someone at a specialist helpline. Your GP surgery will have information on these.\nSome people find it helpful to talk to other people who have mouth cancer, either at a local support group or in an internet chatroom, such as:\n- Cancer Research UK: Cancer chat&nbsp;\n- Macmillan Cancer Support: Head and neck cancer forum&nbsp;\nBeing a carer is not an easy role. When you are busy responding to the needs of others it can deplete your reserves of emotional and physical energy and make it easy for you to neglect your own health and mental wellbeing. Research on carers’ health shows that high numbers of carers suffer health effects through caring. If you are trying to combine caring with a paid job or looking after a family, this can cause even more stress.\nIf you are caring for someone else, it is important to look after yourself and get as much help as possible. It is in your best interests and those of the person you are caring for.\nEat regularly and healthily. If you do not have time to sit down for every meal, try to make time to sit down for at least 1 of your day&#8217;s meals. Instead of relying on fast food snacks, go for healthier options, such as fruit.\nAs well as exhaustion, isolation and&nbsp;worries about the person you are caring for, it is understandable if there are times when you feel resentful and then guilty for feeling like this. These feelings are natural.\nFriends and family may not always understand what you are going through and it can be helpful to talk to people in the same situation. Care Information Scotland&nbsp;has a lot of useful information on its website."

        "disease": "Mouth ulcer",
        "description": "Mouth ulcers are painful sores that appear in the mouth. They&#8217;re uncomfortable but they’re usually harmless. Most clear up by themselves within 1 to 2 weeks.\nMouth ulcers are common and can usually be managed at home, without seeing your dentist or GP.\nMouth ulcers are usually round or oval sores that commonly appear inside the mouth on the:\n- cheeks\n- lips\n- tongue\nThey can be white, red, yellow or grey in colour and swollen.\nYou may have more than one mouth ulcer at a time and they may spread or grow.\nMouth ulcers shouldn&#8217;t be confused with&nbsp;cold sores, which are small blisters that develop on the lips or around the mouth. Cold sores often begin with a tingling, itching or burning sensation around your mouth.\nThey can give you advice and treatment.\nIf you have a dental problem you should always&nbsp;phone your dentist&nbsp;first. If you&#8217;re not registered with any dental practice then you should&nbsp;read our advice on dental emergencies.\nYour pharmacist may advise that you see your GP or dentist if:\n- your mouth ulcer has lasted 3 weeks\n- you keep getting mouth ulcers\n- the mouth ulcer grows bigger than usual or is near the back of your throat\n- your mouth ulcer becomes more painful or red – this could be a sign of a bacterial infection, which may need treatment with&nbsp;antibiotics\nMouth ulcers are also a possible symptom of&nbsp;hand, foot and mouth disease. Speak to your GP or phone&nbsp;111&nbsp;if you&#8217;re unsure.\nMost mouth ulcers clear up by themselves within 1 to 2 weeks without treatment.\nHowever, treatment can help to reduce swelling and ease any discomfort. This may help if you keep getting mouth ulcers or your mouth ulcer affects eating and drinking.\nThere are things you can do to speed up healing.\nYou can get several types of mouth ulcer treatment from a pharmacy. Speak to your pharmacist about the best treatment for you.\nA GP or dentist may prescribe stronger medicine to treat severe, persistent or infected mouth ulcers.\nPossible treatments include:\n- steroid mouth spray or steroid tablets that dissolve in your mouth\n- painkilling gels, ointments, sprays or tablets\n- mouthwashes to kill or remove any germs in your mouth\nIn many cases, the reason for mouth ulcers is unclear. Most single mouth ulcers are caused by damage to the lining inside of the mouth. For example:\n- accidentally biting the inside of your cheek or a sharp tooth\n- poorly fitting dentures\n- hard food\n- a faulty filling\nIt’s not always clear what causes mouth ulcers that keep returning, but triggers are thought to include:\n- stress and anxiety\n- hormonal changes – some women develop mouth ulcers during their monthly period\n- eating certain foods – such as chocolate, spicy foods, coffee, peanuts, almonds, strawberries, cheese, tomatoes and wheat flour\n- toothpaste containing sodium lauryl sulphate\n- stopping smoking – when you first stop smoking, you may develop mouth ulcers\nYour genes are also thought to have a role. Around 40% of people who keep getting mouth ulcers report that it runs in their family.\nMouth ulcers can sometimes be caused by certain medical conditions, such as:\n- viral infections – including the&nbsp;cold sore virus,&nbsp;chickenpox, and&nbsp;hand, foot and mouth disease\n- vitamin B12&nbsp;or&nbsp;iron deficiency\n- crohn&#8217;s disease&nbsp;– a long-term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system\n- coeliac disease&nbsp;– a common digestive condition where a person has an adverse reaction to gluten\n- reactive arthritis&nbsp;– a condition that causes inflammation in various places in the body, usually as a reaction to an infection\n- weakened immune system – for example, due to&nbsp;HIV&nbsp;or&nbsp;lupus\n- behçet’s disease – a rare and poorly understood condition that also causes swelling of the blood vessels\nMouth ulcers can sometimes be caused by certain medications or treatments, such as:\n- non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) – such as&nbsp;ibuprofen\n- nicorandil – a medication sometimes used to treat angina\n- beta-blockers&nbsp;– used to treat conditions such as angina, high blood pressure and abnormal heart rhythms\n- a side effect of&nbsp;chemotherapy&nbsp;or&nbsp;radiotherapy&nbsp;– this is known as mucositis\nIn a few cases, a long-lasting mouth ulcer can be a sign of&nbsp;mouth cancer. If mouth cancer is detected early, the chances of a complete recovery are good.&nbsp;Regular dental check-ups&nbsp;are the best way to detect the early signs."

        "disease": "Multiple myeloma",
        "description": "Multiple myeloma, also known as myeloma, is a type of bone marrow cancer.\nBone marrow is the spongy tissue found at&nbsp;the centre of some&nbsp;bones. It produces the body&#8217;s blood cells. Multiple myeloma&nbsp;affects the plasma cells (a type of blood cell) inside the bone marrow.\nMyeloma does not&nbsp;usually take the form of&nbsp;a lump or tumour. Instead, the myeloma cells divide and expand within the bone marrow, damaging the bones and affecting the production of healthy blood cells.\nMyeloma&nbsp;often&nbsp;affects many places in the body, which is why it is called multiple myeloma. Commonly affected areas include the spine, skull, pelvis and ribs.\nIn the early stages, myeloma may not cause any symptoms. It&#8217;s often only suspected or diagnosed after&nbsp;a routine blood or urine test.\nHowever, myeloma will eventually cause a wide range of&nbsp;problems, including:\n- a persistent dull ache or specific areas of tenderness in your bones\n- weak bones that&nbsp;break (fracture)&nbsp;easily\n- tiredness, weakness and shortness of breath (caused by&nbsp;anaemia)\n- repeated infections\n- less commonly, bruising&nbsp;and unusual bleeding – such as frequent nosebleeds, bleeding gums and&nbsp;heavy periods\nRead more about the symptoms of multiple myeloma\nSpeak to your GP if you have any of these symptoms. While they&#8217;re unlikely to be caused by cancer, it&#8217;s best to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;proper diagnosis.\nYour GP will examine you to check for bone tenderness, bleeding, signs of infection, and any other symptoms that suggest you may have myeloma.\nThey may also arrange&nbsp;blood&nbsp;and urine tests that can detect&nbsp;abnormal proteins produced by myeloma cells.\nIf myeloma is suspected, you will be&nbsp;referred to a consultant haematologist (a specialist in blood conditions) for further tests and treatment.\nRead more about diagnosing&nbsp;multiple myeloma\nMultiple myeloma is an&nbsp;uncommon&nbsp;type of cancer.\nIt&#8217;s not known exactly what causes the condition, although it&#8217;s more common in:\n- people with&nbsp;monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS)&nbsp;–&nbsp;an excess number of protein molecules called immunoglobulins in your blood\n- men\n- adults over 60 –&nbsp;most cases are diagnosed at around the age of 70,&nbsp;and cases affecting people under the age of 40 are rare\n- black people&nbsp;–&nbsp;multiple myeloma is about twice as common in black populations compared with white and Asian populations\nRead more about the causes of multiple myeloma.\nThere is currently no cure for multiple myeloma, but treatment can often help control it for several years.\nTreatment will often involve:\n- a&nbsp;combination of anti-myeloma medications to&nbsp;destroy the myeloma cells\n- medicines and procedures to prevent and treat problems caused by myeloma, such as bone pain, fractures&nbsp;and anaemia\n- anti-myeloma medicines to control the cancer&nbsp;when it comes back (relapses)\nAs part of your treatment, you may be asked if you want to take part in a clinical trial&nbsp;to help researchers develop better treatments for multiple myeloma.\nRead more about treating multiple myeloma\nIf you&#8217;ve been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, you may find it useful to&nbsp;contact a local or national support group, such as Myeloma UK.\nSupport groups can offer more information and advice. They can also often put you in touch with other people in a similar situation so you can share advice and talk about your experiences.\nThe Myeloma UK website has more information about how they can help you and finding a local support group.\nIn the early stages, multiple myeloma may not cause any symptoms or complications, and may only be diagnosed after a routine blood or urine test.\nHowever, it will eventually cause a wide range of problems.\nMultiple myeloma can cause pain in affected bones, most often the back, ribs or hips. The pain is&nbsp;frequently a persistent dull ache,&nbsp;which may be made worse by movement.\nMultiple myeloma can weaken the bones and make them more likely to break (fracture). The spine and ribs are most often affected.\nFractures of the spine can cause the sections of the spine to collapse, leading to pain and occasionally compression of the spinal cord (the main column of nerves running down the back).\nCompression of the spinal cord can cause&nbsp;pins and needles, numbness and weakness in the legs and feet, and sometimes problems controlling your bladder and bowels.\nMultiple myeloma can affect the production of blood cells in our bone marrow, which can lead to a lack of red blood cells (anaemia). This can also occur as a side effect of myeloma treatment.\nIf you have anaemia, you may feel very tired, weak and breathless.\nPeople with multiple myeloma are particularly vulnerable to infection because the condition interferes with the immune system (the body&#8217;s natural defence against infection and illness).\nYou may find you get infections frequently and that they last for a long time.\nA high level of calcium in the blood (hypercalcaemia) can develop in people with multiple myeloma because too much calcium is released from affected bones into the bloodstream.\nSymptoms of hypercalcaemia can include extreme thirst, feeling sick, needing to urinate frequently, constipation, confusion and drowsiness.\nBruising and unusual bleeding (haemorrhage)&nbsp;– such as frequent nosebleeds, bleeding gums and&nbsp;heavy periods – sometimes occurs in multiple myeloma because the cancer cells in your bone marrow can stop blood clotting cells called platelets being made.\nIn some people, multiple myeloma can cause the blood to become thicker than normal. This is known as hyperviscosity, which can cause problems such as blurred vision, headaches, dizziness, bleeding from the gums or nose, and shortness of breath.\nKidney damage can occur in people with multiple myeloma for several reasons. Abnormal proteins produced by&nbsp;the cancer&nbsp;cells can damage the kidneys, as can other complications, such as hypercalcaemia. Some medications used to treat multiple myeloma can also&nbsp;cause kidney damage.\nEventually, the kidneys may stop working properly. This is known as kidney or renal impairment, or kidney or renal failure. Signs of kidney failure can include:\n- weight loss&nbsp;and poor appetite\n- swollen ankles, feet or hands\n- tiredness and a lack of energy\n- shortness of breath\n- itchy skin\n- feeling sick\nYou should speak to your GP if you have symptoms of multiple myeloma. While they&#8217;re unlikely to be caused by cancer, it&#8217;s best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis.\nYou should seek immediate medical help if you have symptoms of spinal cord compression, hypercalcaemia or kidney failure, as these are medical emergencies that need to be investigated and treated as soon as possible.\nRead more about diagnosing multiple myeloma&nbsp;and treating multiple myeloma\nIn multiple myeloma, cells inside the bone marrow called plasma cells become cancerous.\nBone marrow is the spongy tissue found at the centre of some bones. It produces the body&#8217;s blood cells.\nPlasma cells are normally produced in&nbsp;a controlled way. In cases of multiple myeloma, large numbers of abnormal plasma cells are produced. These fill up the bone marrow and interfere with the production of other cells, such as red and white blood cells.\nThe exact reason why this happens is unknown, but multiple myeloma is closely associated with a condition called monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS), and there are certain things that can increase your risk of developing it.\nIn almost all cases, multiple myeloma occurs in someone who previously had MGUS.\nMGUS is the name for having an excess number of protein molecules called immunoglobulins in your blood. This does not cause any symptoms and treatment is not required.\nHowever, every year around&nbsp;1 in every 100 people with MGUS go on to develop multiple myeloma. There is no known way to delay or prevent this, so&nbsp;ongoing outpatient&nbsp;tests to check for cancer will usually be recommended if you have MGUS.\nAs well as MGUS, certain things can increase your risk of developing multiple myeloma, including:\n- age – your risk of developing multiple myeloma increases as you get older; most cases are diagnosed at around the age of&nbsp;70, and cases affecting people under 40 are rare\n- gender – men are more likely to develop multiple myeloma than women\n- ethnicity – multiple myeloma is about twice as common in black populations compared with white and Asian populations\nIt has also been suggested that having a family history of MGUS or multiple myeloma, having reduced immunity (for example, because of medication or HIV), being overweight or obese, and being exposed to radiation or certain chemicals may increase your risk of multiple myeloma. However, a link between these factors and the condition is less clear.\nMultiple myeloma can be difficult to diagnose because it&#8217;s an uncommon type of cancer that initially has few or no symptoms.\nYour GP will examine you and ask about your symptoms, medical history and overall health. During the examination, your GP will look for things such as bleeding, signs of infection and specific areas of bone tenderness.\nYou may need urine and&nbsp;blood tests to check for certain types of antibodies and proteins (immunoglobulins).\nIf multiple myeloma is suspected,&nbsp;you&nbsp;will be&nbsp;referred to a haematologist (a doctor who specialises in conditions affecting the blood) for further tests and&nbsp;scans.\nA number of blood tests are used to help diagnose multiple myeloma, and they may need to be repeated to monitor the condition.\nThese may include:\n- erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or plasma viscosity (PV) –&nbsp;if you have multiple myeloma, your ESR or PV will usually be raised\n- tests to measure the type and number of abnormal antibodies produced by the cancerous plasma cells\n- a full blood count (FBC) to check levels of different types of blood cells&nbsp;– your doctor will be looking for a low number of red blood cells and platelets\n- liver and kidney function\n- blood calcium level\nA urine sample will be checked for the abnormal proteins produced by the cancerous plasma cells. The abnormal proteins are known as monoclonal light chains,&nbsp;or Bence Jones protein.\nThese proteins can damage your kidneys as they pass through them from your blood to your urine. You may be asked to collect your urine over a 24-hour period. This will be used to check the quantity of proteins being produced and how well your kidneys are working.\nYou will have&nbsp;X-rays&nbsp;taken of your long bones (arms and legs), skull, spine and pelvis to look for any damage.\nOther scans, such as&nbsp;computerised tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, may also be carried out.\nA bone marrow&nbsp;biopsy is usually needed to confirm multiple myeloma. A needle will be used to take a small sample of bone marrow from one of your bones, usually the pelvis. A sample of bone may also be removed.\nThis is carried out using a&nbsp;local anaesthetic&nbsp;(the area where the needle is inserted is numbed).\nThe sample of bone marrow and bone will be used&nbsp;to check for cancerous plasma cells.\nIf you have multiple myeloma, you will be cared for by a team, which is usually led by a consultant haematologist who specialises in myeloma.\nThe team will discuss your condition and recommend the best treatment for you. However, the final decision will be yours.\nBefore visiting hospital to discuss your treatment options, it may be useful to write a list of questions to ask the specialist. For example, you may want to find out the advantages and disadvantages of a particular treatment.\nThere are 2 main aims in treating multiple myeloma:\n- to bring the myeloma under control\n- to prevent and treat problems associated with myeloma, such as&nbsp;anaemia and bone pain\nWhile treatment can often control myeloma and improve quality of life, myeloma usually can&#8217;t be cured. This means additional treatment is needed when the cancer comes back (a relapse).\nNot everyone diagnosed with myeloma will need immediate treatment if the condition is not causing any problems. This is sometimes referred to as asymptomatic, or smouldering myeloma.\nIf you don&#8217;t need treatment, you&#8217;ll be monitored for signs the cancer is beginning to cause problems. If you do need treatment, the following options are most commonly used.\nThe initial treatment for multiple myeloma may be either:\n- non-intensive – for older or less fit patients (this is more common)\n- intensive – for younger or fitter patients (thought to be too toxic for older or less fit patients)\nThe decision about which treatment is appropriate for you is usually based on your biological age or fitness.\nAs a general rule, people younger than 65 are more likely to be candidates for intensive therapy. For those over 70, non-intensive treatment is more likely to be recommended.\nThose aged in between will be given careful consideration as to what treatment group they fall into.\nBoth non-intensive and intensive treatments involve taking a combination of anti-myeloma medicines. Intensive treatment involves much higher doses and is followed by a stem cell transplant.\nThe medicines usually include a chemotherapy medicine, a steroid medicine, and either thalidomide or bortezomib.\nChemotherapy medicines kill the myeloma cells. The most common types used to treat myeloma are melphalan and cyclophosphamide.\nThese treatments are mostly taken in tablet form. They are reasonably well tolerated and side effects are mild. Possible side effects include:\n- increased risk of infections\n- feeling sick\n- vomiting\n- hair loss\nYour clinician will give you advice and information about your risk of developing potentially serious infections, and&nbsp;tell you what you can do to reduce your risk of picking up infections during your treatment.\nSteroid medications (corticosteroids)&nbsp;help destroy myeloma cells and make chemotherapy more effective.&nbsp;The 2 most common types used to treat myeloma are dexamethasone and&nbsp;prednisolone.\nSteroids are taken orally (by mouth) after eating. Possible side effects include heartburn, indigestion, increased appetite, mood changes and problems falling asleep.\nThalidomide can help kill myeloma cells. You take&nbsp;it as a tablet every day, usually&nbsp;in the evening&nbsp;as it can make you feel sleepy.\nOther common side effects include:\n- constipation&nbsp;\n- dizziness\n- rashes\n- numbness or tingling in the hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy)\nThalidomide can cause birth defects, so it should not be taken by pregnant women, and a reliable form of&nbsp;contraception such as a condom must be used during treatment.\nThere is also a risk you may develop a blood clot when taking thalidomide, so you may be given medication to help prevent this. Contact your care team immediately if you develop symptoms of a blood clot, such as pain or swelling in one of your legs, or chest pain and breathlessness.\nBortezomib (Velcade) can help kill myeloma cells by causing protein to build-up inside them.\nThere are some limitations as to who can have bortezomib, but a member of your care team will discuss this with you.\nThe medication is given by injection, usually under the skin.&nbsp;Possible side effects include:\n- tiredness\n- nausea\n- diarrhoea&nbsp;\n- numbness or tingling in your hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy)\nAfter initial therapy with primarily outpatient-based treatments, people receiving intensive treatment will be given a much higher dose of chemotherapy medication as an inpatient to potentially help destroy a larger number of myeloma cells. This aims to achieve a longer period of remission (where there is no sign of active disease in your body).\nHowever, these high doses also affect healthy bone marrow, so a&nbsp;stem cell transplant&nbsp;will be needed to help your bone marrow recover.\nIn most cases, the stem cells will be collected from you before treatment (autologous transplantation). In rare cases, they are collected from a sibling or an unrelated donor.\nFurther treatment is needed if myeloma returns. Treatment for relapses is generally similar to initial treatment, although non-intensive treatment is often preferred to further intensive treatment.\nAdditional medications such as lenalidomide, pomalidomide and other chemotherapy medicines may be added, or used&nbsp;again as your haematologist feels is appropriate.\nYou may also be asked if you want to participate in clinical trial research into&nbsp;new treatments for multiple myeloma.\nLenalidomide and pomalidomide are similar to thalidomide. They&#8217;re both taken by mouth, and both can&nbsp;have an effect on the cells produced by your bone marrow, which can cause:\n- increased risk of infection – as&nbsp;a result of&nbsp;a low number of white blood cells\n- anaemia –&nbsp;caused by&nbsp;a low number of red blood cells\n- bruising and bleeding –&nbsp;because of&nbsp;a low platelet count\nThey may also increase your risk of developing a blood clot and have other side effects similar to thalidomide.\nLet your care team know if you experience any problems or unusual symptoms while taking lenalidomide or pomalidomide.\nAs well as the main treatments for multiple myeloma, you may also need treatment to help relieve some of the problems caused by the condition.\nFor example:\n- painkillers – may be given to reduce pain\n- radiotherapy&nbsp;– may be used to relieve bone pain&nbsp;or help healing after a bone is surgically repaired\n- bisphosphonate medication – either&nbsp;given as tablets or by injection, this may&nbsp;help prevent bone damage and reduce the levels of calcium in your blood\n- blood transfusions or&nbsp;erythropoietin medication – may be used&nbsp;to increase your red blood cell count and&nbsp;treat anaemia\n- surgery – may be carried out&nbsp;to repair or strengthen damaged bones, or treat compression of the spinal cord (the main column of nerves running down the back)\n- dialysis&nbsp;– may be&nbsp;required if you develop kidney failure\n- plasma exchange&nbsp;– treatment to remove and replace a blood component called plasma may be carried out if you have unusually thick blood (hyperviscosity)\nThese treatments can each cause side effects and complications, so make sure you discuss the potential risks and benefits with your treatment team beforehand.\nResearch is ongoing to find new treatments for multiple myeloma and work out ways to improve the use of existing ones. To help with this, you may be asked to take part in a clinical trial&nbsp;during your treatment.\nClinical trials usually involve comparing a new treatment with an existing one to see whether the new treatment is more or less effective.\nIt&#8217;s important to remember, however, that if you are given a new treatment, there is no guarantee it will be more effective than an existing treatment.\nThere will never be any pressure for you to take part in a trial if you do not want to.\nSearch clinical trials for multiple myeloma"

        "disease": "Multiple sclerosis (MS)",
        "description": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a condition that affects the brain and/or spinal cord. It can cause symptoms like problems with vision, arm or leg movement, sensation or balance.\nIt&#8217;s a lifelong condition that can sometimes cause serious disability. In many cases, it’s possible to treat symptoms. Average life expectancy is slightly reduced for people with MS.\nMS Society estimates that there are more than 130,000 people diagnosed with MS in the UK.\nIt&#8217;s often diagnosed in people in their 20s and 30s, although it can develop at any age. It&#8217;s about two to three times more common in women than men.\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) can cause a wide range of symptoms and can affect any part of the body. It affects everyone differently.\nThe symptoms are unpredictable. Some people&#8217;s symptoms develop and worsen over time, while for others, they come and go.\nPeriods when symptoms get worse are known as relapses. Periods when symptoms improve or disappear are known as remissions.\nSome of the most common symptoms include:\nMS&nbsp;can cause your&nbsp;muscles to:\n- feel weak\n- become stiff and resistant to movement (spasticity)\n- contract tightly and painfully (spasm)\nIn around 1 in 4 cases of MS, the first noticeable symptom is a problem with one of your eyes (optic neuritis). You may experience:\n- some temporary&nbsp;loss of vision in the affected eye, usually lasting for days to weeks\n- colour blindness&nbsp;\n- eye pain, which is usually worse when moving the eye\n- flashes of light when moving the eye\nYou might also experience double vision or involuntary eye movements, which can make it seem as though objects are jumping around.\nYou might have persistent numbness or tingling in different parts of your body which can last a few days to weeks.\nMS can make walking and moving around difficult, particularly if you also have muscle weakness and spasticity. You may experience:\n- clumsiness\n- difficulty with balance and co-ordination (ataxia)\n- shaking of the limbs (tremor)\n- dizziness and vertigo, which can make it feel as though\n- everything around you is spinning\nSome people with MS experience pain which can take two forms.\nThis is pain caused by damage to the nervous system, and can include:\n- stabbing pains in the face\n- stabbing sensations in the torso (body) and limbs\n- feeling like you&#8217;re burning\n- pins and needles\n- feeling like you&#8217;re being hugged or squeezed\nMuscle spasms can sometimes be painful.\nThis can be back, neck and joint pain particularly if you have problems walking or moving around.\nBladder problems are common in MS. They may include:\n- having to pee more often\n- having a sudden, urgent need to pee, which can lead to\n- unintentionally passing urine (urge incontinence)\n- difficulty emptying the bladder completely\n- having to get up during the night to pee\n- recurrent urinary tract infections\nThese problems can also have a range of causes other than MS.\nMany people with MS also have problems with their bowel function.\nConstipation is the most common problem. You may find passing stools (poo) difficult and pass them much less than normal.\nBowel incontinence is less common, but is often linked to constipation. If a poo becomes stuck, it can irritate the wall of the bowel, causing it to produce more fluid and mucus that can leak out of your bottom.\nSome of these problems aren&#8217;t specific to MS and can be the result of medications.\nMS can have an effect on sexual function.\nFor women, problems include difficulty reaching orgasm. They might experience decreased vaginal lubrication and sensation.\nMen with MS might find it hard to get or maintain an erection (erectile dysfunction). They may also find it takes a lot longer to ejaculate when having sex or masturbating. They might lose the ability to ejaculate altogether.\nBoth men and women with MS may find they&#8217;re less interested in sex than they were before. This could be directly related to MS, a mood disorder like depression, or it could be the result of living with the condition.\nSome people with MS have difficulty chewing or swallowing (dysphagia) at some point. They might also slur their speech or be difficult to understand (dysarthria).\nFeeling fatigued is a common and troublesome symptom of MS.\nIt can cause an overwhelming sense of exhaustion that means it&#8217;s a struggle to carry out simple tasks.\nFatigue tends to get worse:\n- towards the end of each day\n- in hot weather\n- after exercising\n- during illness\nMany people with MS experience periods of depression. It&#8217;s unclear if this is directly caused by MS, or is due to the stress of having to live with a long-term condition, or both.\nAnxiety can also be a problem for people with MS, possibly due to the unpredictable nature of the condition.\nIn rare cases, people with MS can experience rapid and severe mood swings.\nSome people with MS have problems with thinking, learning and planning. This is known as cognitive dysfunction and can include:\n- problems learning and remembering new things although long-term memory is usually unaffected\n- slowness in processing lots of information or multi-tasking\n- a shortened attention span\n- getting stuck on words\n- problems with understanding and processing visual information, such as reading a map\n- difficulty with planning and problem solving – people often report that they know what they want to do, but can&#8217;t grasp how to do it\n- problems with reasoning, such as mathematical laws or solving puzzles\nMany of these problems aren&#8217;t specific to MS. They can be caused by other conditions, including depression and anxiety or medication.\nThe symptoms can be similar to several other conditions, so they&#8217;re not necessarily caused by MS.\nMS is an autoimmune condition. This means your immune system mistakes part of your body for a foreign substance and attacks it.\nIn the case of MS, it attacks the myelin sheath in the brain and/or spinal cord. This is the layer that surrounds your nerves, protecting them and helping electrical signals travel from the brain to the rest of the body.\nThe attacks cause the myelin sheath to become inflamed in small patches (plaques or lesions). This can be seen on a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.\nThese patches of inflammation can disrupt the messages travelling along the nerves. It can slow them down, jumble them, send them the wrong way, or stop them from getting through completely. This disruption leads to the symptoms and signs of MS.\nWhen the inflammation goes away, it can leave behind scarring of the myelin sheath (sclerosis). These attacks, particularly if frequent and repeated, can lead to permanent damage.\nExactly why someone develops multiple sclerosis (MS) isn&#8217;t known. It&#8217;s not caused by anything you&#8217;ve done and it&#8217;s not clear if you can prevent it.\nIt&#8217;s likely to be partly caused by genes you inherit from your parents and partly by outside factors that may trigger the condition.\nSome of the factors that might cause MS include:\nMS isn&#8217;t directly inherited, but if you&#8217;re related to someone with&nbsp;the condition you&#8217;re more likely to develop it. The chance of a sibling or child of someone with MS also developing it is around 2-3%.\nMS is more common in countries far from the equator. This could&nbsp;mean that a lack of sunlight and low vitamin D levels may play a role in the condition. It&#8217;s not clear whether vitamin D supplements can help prevent MS.\nPeople who smoke are about twice as likely to develop MS compared to&nbsp;those who don&#8217;t smoke.\nInfections, particularly those caused by the Epstein-Barr virus, (responsible for glandular fever), might trigger the immune system, leading to MS in some people.\nMore research will help us understand&nbsp;why MS occurs and whether it can be prevented or not.\nIt can be hard to tell if you have multiple sclerosis (MS) because some of the symptoms are like other conditions. You may need to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms first.\nIf your GP thinks you could have MS, you should see a neurologist&nbsp;(a specialist in conditions of the nervous system) for a specialist assessment.\nSome of the tests you may need to confirm MS are:\n- neurological examination\n- magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan\n- lumbar puncture\n- blood test\nOnce you have a diagnosis of MS, your neurologist might be able to identify which type of MS you have &#8211; either relapsing remitting MS or primary progressive MS.\nThis will largely be based on:\n- the pattern of your symptoms &#8211; like whether you experience periods when your symptoms get worse (relapses) then improve (remissions), or whether they get steadily worse (progress)\n- the results of an MRI scan\nIt can take some time to find out which type of MS you have because the symptoms are so varied. It can take a few years to make an accurate diagnosis of progressive MS, as the condition usually worsens slowly.\nAlthough there isn&#8217;t a cure for MS, there are medicines that can help to reduce the number and severity of relapses in some people. These are called disease-modifying therapies or disease modifying drugs.\nThese reduce the amount of damage and scarring to the myelin sheath (layer surrounding your nerves), associated with MS relapses.\nThese treatments reduce the chances of developing progressive symptoms of MS. They might also help to slow worsening disability in MS.\nDisease-modifying therapies are not suitable for everyone with MS. They&#8217;re only prescribed to those with either:\n- relapsing remitting MS\n- secondary progressive MS who meet certain criteria, like the number of relapses they&#8217;ve had\n- primary progressive MS who meet certain criteria like new lesions found by an MRI scan\nPeople without relapses are less likely to benefit from the treatments and could still experience side effects from them.\nSometimes an infection can cause a flare up of symptoms rather than a relapse, so your nurse or GP will check for other possible causes.\nTreatment for a relapse might involve a five-day course of steroid tablets taken at home.\nSteroids can help speed up your recovery from a relapse. They don&#8217;t prevent further relapses or stop MS getting worse over time.\nSteroids are only given for a short period of time to avoid possible steroid side effects. The side effects could include infection, mood disturbance, stomach ulceration, osteoporosis (weak bones), weight gain and diabetes.\nNot using steroids more than three times a year (if possible) will help to reduce the risk of side effects.\nThere are different treatments available for MS symptoms.\nYour healthcare professional should give you advice about ways to manage fatigue. This might include exercise, keeping healthy sleep patterns and energy-saving techniques. Your healthcare professional might suggest avoiding medications that can worsen fatigue.\nSpecialist fatigue management courses or therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), might also help.\nMS-related visual problems will often improve on their own, usually within a few weeks. If your symptoms are particularly severe, your healthcare professional might prescribe steroids.\nIf you have problems with involuntary eye movements, medication like gabapentin can sometimes help. Some people with double vision need help from ophthalmologists (eye specialists).\nPhysiotherapy can help improve muscle spasms and stiffness.\nTechniques&nbsp;such as stretching exercises can help if your movement is restricted.\nIf your muscle spasms are more severe, you may be prescribed a medicine that can relax your muscles. This will usually be either baclofen, gabapentin or tizanidine.\nThese medicines all have side effects. You might experience dizziness, weakness, nausea and diarrhoea. Discuss which of these would be best for you with your&nbsp;specialist MS nurse.\nMobility problems are often the result of muscle spasms and spasticity. Muscle weakness, or problems with balance or dizziness can also cause mobility problems.\nIf you have problems with mobility, your healthcare professional might suggest:\n- an exercise programme&nbsp;supervised by a physiotherapist\n- special exercises called vestibular rehabilitation, if you have problems with balance\n- medication for dizziness or tremors\n- mobility aids, such as a walking stick, or a wheelchair\n- home adaptations such as stair lifts or railings\nAn occupational therapist can carry out an assessment of your home and suggest adaptations.\nLiving with MS can cause stresses and strains to the muscles and joints in your body.\nA physiotherapist might be able to help with&nbsp;this pain by suggesting exercises or better seating positions.\nIf your pain is more severe, you may be prescribed painkillers. Or, you might have a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) machine that stimulates your nerves.\nNeuropathic pain is caused by damage to your nerves and is usually sharp and stabbing. It can also occur in the form of extreme skin sensitivity, or a burning sensation.\nThis type of pain can be treated using neuropathic painkillers.\nYour MS healthcare professionals can assess your thinking, learning and memory problems and suggest ways to manage them.\nPeople with MS who have depression or anxiety can be treated with antidepressants or therapy, such as CBT.\nIf you have emotional outbursts, such as laughing or crying for no clear reason, you should be assessed by a specialist. They may suggest treatment with an antidepressant.\nMedication might help if you have an overactive bladder or need to pee frequently during the night.\nIf you find it difficult to empty your bladder, advice from a continence nurse or physiotherapist can help. Hand-held external stimulators can help some people to start peeing or to empty the bladder.\nSometimes a catheter can empty the bladder when needed. You might be taught how to do intermittent self catheterisation (ISC).\nIn rare cases, people with MS may need a long-term catheter to keep the bladder emptying safely.\nYou might be referred to a continence adviser or urologist, for specialist treatment and advice. Read more about treating urinary incontinence.\nIt might be possible to treat mild to moderate constipation by changing your diet or taking laxatives.\nMore severe constipation may need to be treated with suppositories, which are inserted into your bottom, or an enema. During an enema, liquid medication is rinsed through your bottom and large bowel, which softens and flushes out your stools.\nAnti diarrhoea medication or pelvic floor exercises might help bowel incontinence.\nIf you experience problems with less interest in sex or difficulty reaching orgasm, relationship counselling or seeing a sex therapist might help.\nIf you have MS and find it hard to get or maintain an erection (erectile dysfunction) you may be prescribed medication to increase the blood flow to the penis.\nA&nbsp;speech and language therapist can help you find ways to overcome problems with speech and swallowing.\nFor example, they can offer advice about foods that are easy to swallow. They might recommend exercises to strengthen the muscles used in speech and swallowing.\nSome people with MS find that complementary therapies help them feel better. Complementary treatments and therapies claim to ease symptoms, although scientific evidence is often not clear about how effective they are.\nMany people think that complementary treatments have no harmful effects. However, people can experience problems. It’s not a good idea to use them as an alternative to medicines prescribed by your doctor. If you&#8217;re considering an alternative treatment, it&#8217;s important to let your doctor know.\nClinical trials have helped to improve the treatments available for MS.\nSpeak to your care team if you&#8217;re interested in taking part in a clinical trial.\nComing to terms with a long-term condition like MS can put a strain on you, your family and your friends. Be honest about how you feel and let your family and friends know what they can do to help.\nIf you have any questions, your&nbsp;MS nurse or GP can help and will let you know what support is available.\nIf you find it difficult to look after yourself, your local authority may be able to provide you with some help.&nbsp;Ask for a care and support needs assessment. For more information, read about assessing your care and support needs.\nBeing diagnosed with MS shouldn&#8217;t affect your ability to have children. Women with MS can have a normal pregnancy, deliver a healthy baby and breastfeed.\nSome of the medications prescribed for MS aren&#8217;t suitable for taking during pregnancy or breastfeeding and might affect fertility in&nbsp;males and females.&nbsp;If you&#8217;re considering starting a family, discuss it with your healthcare team.\nHaving a baby doesn&#8217;t affect the long-term course of MS. Relapses can be less common in pregnancy, but they can be more common in the months after giving birth.\nIf you have to stop work or work part-time because of your MS, you may find it hard to cope financially. You might be able to get financial support.\nIf you have MS, you must tell the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and inform your insurance company.\nYou might be able to continue driving, but you’ll be asked to complete a form providing more information about your condition. You&#8217;ll be asked for details of your doctors and specialists. The DVLA will use this to decide whether you&#8217;re fit to drive."

        "disease": "Multiple system atrophy (MSA)",
        "description": "Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a neurological condition that affects adults. It&#8217;s caused by the degeneration (damage) or atrophy (shrinking) of nerve cells in different parts of the brain.\nEveryone with MSA will experience different symptoms. Symptoms often start between the ages of 50 and 60, but they can begin anytime from the age of 30.\nYou&#8217;re likely to experience muscle control or balance problems, like those of&nbsp;Parkinson&#8217;s disease&nbsp;or&nbsp;Ataxia. It&#8217;s a progressive disease which means symptoms will worsen over a period of time.\nMSA can cause symptoms including:\n- bladder problems like a constant need to pee, loss of bladder control (urinary incontinence) or being unable to pee\n- low blood pressure when standing up which might cause&nbsp;dizziness&nbsp;or fainting (postural hypotension)\n- erection problems like&nbsp;erectile dysfunction\n- problems with co-ordination, balance and speech (cerebellar ataxia)\n- tremor, slowness and muscle stiffness\n- constipation\nSomeone with MSA might also have:\n- uncontrollable laughing or crying\n- problems with sleep like&nbsp;insomnia, restless legs or nightmares\n- noisy breathing\n- unintentional sighing\n- weak, quiet voice\n- shoulder and neck pain\n- problems controlling sweating\n- swallowing problems including difficult chewing and choking episodes\n- blurred vision\n- cold hands and feet\nThe cause of MSA is not clear. It&#8217;s not thought to be inherited.\nHaving MSA appears to be random. It&#8217;s not because of something the person with MSA has done. It has no connection to multiple sclerosis (MS).\nThere&#8217;s ongoing research into the possible causes of MSA.\nThere are many neurological conditions that look similar in the early stages. It might take some time to get a diagnosis of MSA.\nThere isn&#8217;t a specific test for MSA. Your doctor will look at your symptoms and rule out other conditions, like Parkinson&#8217;s disease.\nIt&#8217;s more likely you have MSA if:\n- your symptoms have progressed quickly\n- you&#8217;ve had falls in the early stages of the condition\n- you don&#8217;t respond well to the medicine levodopa\n- your speech has been severely affected\n- you gasp and breathe noisily\nIf your doctor thinks you might have MSA, they&#8217;ll test your reflexes and bodily functions like bladder control and blood pressure.\nYou might have a brain scan, like an MRI scan, to detect if there&#8217;s been a loss of brain cells.\nThere isn&#8217;t a cure for MSA and there isn&#8217;t a way of slowing its progress.\nAs symptoms worsen, you might need help managing day to day life.\nVisit the&nbsp;MSA Trust website&nbsp;for information and support about living with MSA. They have a dedicated MSA charity nurses who can help to support you.\nTreatment of MSA involves a combination of medication, specialist equipment and the involvement of therapists to manage specific symptoms. It might take time to find the right combination of treatments which work best for you.\nYou might be prescribed medication to help with the stiffness and slowness caused by MSA. Their benefits are limited and they can make blood pressure problems worse.\nA physiotherapist can give you regular exercises to do. This can help strengthen your muscles and prevent your joints from stiffening.\nThey&#8217;ll also consider if there&#8217;s any equipment that would help you like a walking frame or shoes that can help reduce your risk of falls.\nYou might be taught breathing exercises to reduce the chance of developing aspiration pneumonia (a chest infection caused by inhaling particles of food into your lungs) when you eat.\nPhysiotherapists and occupational therapists can provide advice and equipment to help you live safely. For example, they might suggest you have handrails fitted to help you keep your balance. They can teach you exercises and strategies to help you avoid falls.\nUrology and continence specialists can recommend treatment to help manage bladder problems.\nIf you&#8217;re having problems emptying your bladder, you might have intermittent catheterisation. This involves putting a tube into the bladder to drain the pee.\nThis can be done intermittently then removed. Or it can be placed permanently either through the urethra or abdominal (stomach) wall.\nPeople with MSA who have postural hypotension produce less pee during the day and more at night. There are medications that can help manage this if it becomes disruptive during the night and affects your sleep.\nYou might want to use a commode or urinal at your bedside for during the night. This might be useful if you have low blood pressure or are prone to falls.\nYou should try to drink plenty fluids and eat a well balanced diet to try to avoid becoming constipated.\nIf you do experience constipation you&#8217;ll be offered medication to take regularly. Suppositories can be helpful to avoid straining.\nIf you have episodes of diarrhoea (loose stools) this is likely to be caused by severe constipation. Speak to your doctor if this happens to you.\nLess commonly, someone with MSA might have regular diarrhoea. Speak to your doctor if this happens to you.\nErectile dysfunction (inability to get or maintain an erection) is often the first symptom of MSA. There&#8217;s medication available to help with erectile dysfunction but it can cause problems with your blood pressure.\nYou might experience problems with your libido and sexual function.\nThe MSA Trust have more information about&nbsp;relationships and sex for people with MSA.\nYou might feel dizzy when you stand up or change position because your blood pressure falls quickly.\nSometimes this can be helped by drinking more fluids and eating more salt. Leg exercises that increase blood flow in your calves can help too. You should avoid sudden changes in position like standing up quickly.\nIf your blood pressure can&#8217;t be controlled by these practical methods, you might be offered medication to help with this.\nRead more about&nbsp;living with postural hypotension (dizziness)\nYou might see a speech and language therapist who&#8217;ll try to help with your problems with speech and swallowing (dysphagia).\nTogether with a dietitian they might suggest changing the consistency of your food to make it easier to swallow.\nThey might be able to give you techniques you can use to make your voice clearer. They&#8217;ll suggest communication aids or devices if they think they might help you.\nYou might be offered a feeding tube if you:\n- experience coughing or choking when eating or drinking\n- struggle to eat and drink enough to stay well\nA dietitian will help advise you how to eat a healthy balanced diet including more food and liquids that are easy to swallow.\nIf there&#8217;s a risk of malnutrition and dehydration, you might be offered a feeding tube.\nYou might be referred to a respiratory team if you have breathing problems like sleep apnoea or stridor.\nThey might recommend overnight non invasive ventilation, like CPAP.\nYou can choose to have palliative care at any stage of&nbsp;MSA in addition to other treatments.\nThe aim of palliative care is to relieve pain and other symptoms alongside psychological, spiritual and social support.\nYou might receive palliative care:\n- at home\n- in a hospice or care home\n- as an outpatient in a hospital\n- in a hospital\nYou might want to consider making plans for the future to help your family and health professionals plan your medical care.\nThis will be useful if you&#8217;re unable to communicate later on because you&#8217;re too ill.\nYou don&#8217;t have to make these plans if you don&#8217;t want to.\nRead more about future care planning"

        "disease": "Mumps",
        "description": "Mumps is an infection that spreads easily. It used to be common in children before the introduction of the&nbsp;measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.\nMumps usually clears within 1 or 2 weeks.\nThe symptoms of mumps usually develop 14 to 25 days after you&#8217;re infected.\nMumps causes painful swellings at the side of the face under the ears (the parotid glands). It gives a distinctive &#8216;hamster face&#8217; appearance.\nOther symptoms of mumps can include:\n- headaches\n- joint pain\n- feeling sick\n- dry mouth\n- mild stomach (abdominal) pain\n- feeling tired\n- loss of appetite\n- a high temperature (fever) of 38°C (100.4°F), or above\nThese may develop a few days before the swelling of the parotid glands.\nSometimes, mumps doesn&#8217;t cause any noticeable symptoms.\nMumps is not usually serious, but it has similar symptoms to more serious types of infection, such as&nbsp;glandular fever&nbsp;and&nbsp;tonsillitis.\nYou should phone your GP first before visiting. They can make arrangements to reduce the risk of spreading the infection to others.\nYour GP can usually make a diagnosis after:\n- seeing and feeling the swelling\n- looking at the position of the tonsils in the mouth\n- checking your temperature to see if it&#8217;s higher than normal\nIf your GP suspects mumps, they should notify your local health protection team (HPT).\nMost cases of mumps occur in people aged between 17 and 34 who have not received 2 doses of the&nbsp;MMR vaccine.\nOnce you&#8217;ve had mumps, your body builds up resistance (immunity) to the virus. It&#8217;s highly unlikely you&#8217;ll get it again.\nThe mumps virus is contained in tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when an infected person coughs or sneezes.\nYou can easily catch mumps by breathing in these droplets. Or, if the droplets have settled on a surface, by touching the surface and then placing your hands near your nose or mouth.\nA person is most contagious a few days before the symptoms develop and for a few days afterwards.\nIf you have mumps:\n- stay off school or work for at least 5 days after your symptoms first develop\n- regularly wash your hands with soap\n- use and dispose of tissues when you sneeze\n- avoid close contact with anyone who isn&#8217;t fully vaccinated\nMumps can be prevented by having the&nbsp;MMR vaccine.\nThis is given in 2 doses as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme.\nYou can be vaccinated at any age if you haven&#8217;t been fully vaccinated before.\nThere are things you can do to help relieve your symptoms.\nMumps usually passes without causing serious damage to a person&#8217;s health. Serious complications are rare.\nHowever, mumps can lead to viral&nbsp;meningitis&nbsp;if the virus moves into the outer layer of the brain. Other complications include swelling of the testicles in males or the ovaries in females if the affected person has gone through puberty.\nAbout 1 in 20 cases of mumps lead to&nbsp;acute pancreatitis. This is usually mild, but you may be admitted to hospital so your body functions can be supported until your pancreas recovers.\nAbout 1 in 20 people with mumps experience some temporary&nbsp;hearing loss, but permanent loss of hearing is rare."

        "disease": "Munchausen’s syndrome",
        "description": "Munchausen&#8217;s syndrome is a rare psychological and behavioural condition in which somebody fabricates or induces symptoms of illness in themselves.\nMunchausen&#8217;s syndrome is named after a German aristocrat, Baron Munchausen, who became famous for telling wild, unbelievable tales about his exploits and past.\nPeople with Munchausen&#8217;s syndrome typically display a set pattern of behaviour. This pattern includes:\n- lying about their symptoms and typically also lying about other aspects of their life, such as their past or level of education\n- manipulating test results to suggest the presence of symptoms, such as adding blood to urine samples\n- actually inflicting symptoms on themselves, such as poisoning themselves with an overdose of medication, and\n- travelling from hospital to hospital in different parts of the country, and seeing many different doctors\nMunchausen&#8217;s syndrome differs from two, more common, types of feigned illness, hypochondria and malingering. People who have hypochondria actually believe they are ill, but do not manipulate test results. People who malinger pretend to be ill to gain some sort of benefit, such as avoiding military duty or trying to obtain compensation.\nPeople with Munchausen&#8217;s syndrome know they&#8217;re making their symptoms up and can be highly manipulative, but their behaviour brings them no obvious benefit. Instead, they often undergo painful and sometimes life-threatening surgery, even though they know it is unnecessary.\nIt is hard to estimate how many people are affected by Munchausen&#8217;s syndrome. They tend to be highly secretive and often use a number of false identities. Once their deception is uncovered they discharge themselves from hospital and move to another area.\nThe condition is thought to be most common in white men aged between 30 and 50. It is unclear why this is the case.\nThe causes of Munchausen&#8217;s syndrome are largely unknown. Most people who have been diagnosed with the condition refuse to accept any sort of psychiatric treatment so little is known about their motives or thought processes.\nThere is a variant of Munchausen&#8217;s syndrome, called Munchausen&#8217;s syndrome by proxy, in which an individual fabricates or induces illness in a person under their care, typically a child.\nWarning signs that somebody may have Munchausen&#8217;s syndrome include:\n- frequent visits to hospitals in different areas\n- claiming to have a history of complex and serious medical conditions, yet there is little documentary evidence to support this; a common ruse is for people to claim they have spent a long time out of the country\n- symptoms that do not correspond to the results of tests\n- symptoms that get worse for no apparent reason\n- the person has a extremely good medical knowledge\n- the person receives very few, or no, visitors in hospital; many people with Munchausen&#8217;s syndrome adopt a solitary lifestyle and have little contact with any friends of family\n- a willingness to undergo often painful or dangerous tests and procedures\n- if confronted about their behaviour, they can become aggressive and will try to leave the hospital\nThere are four main ways in which people with Munchausen&#8217;s syndrome can feign or induce illnesses, which are outlined below:\n- lying about symptoms &#8211; often they choose symptoms that are hard to disprove, such as having severe headaches or they may pretend to have a seizure or pass out\n- tampering with test results &#8211; such as heating thermometers to suggest fever or adding blood to urine samples\n- self-infliction &#8211; they may cut or burn themselves, poison themselves with drugs or an overdose of medication, or eat food that has been contaminated with bacteria\n- aggravate pre-existing conditions &#8211; such as rubbing dirt or dog faeces into wounds to cause an infection, or reopen previously healed wounds\nAs most people with Munchausen&#8217;s syndrome refuse to co-operate with any sort of psychiatric treatment or psychological profiling, there is little available evidence on the possible causes of the condition.\nThere is a consensus of opinion that Munchausen&#8217;s syndrome is a type of personality disorder. Personality disorders are a class of mental health conditions in which an individual has a distorted pattern of thoughts and beliefs about themselves and others which lead them to behave in ways most people would regard as disturbed and abnormal.\nOne theory is that people with Munchausen&#8217;s syndrome have an anti-social personality disorder which causes them to take pleasure in manipulating and deceiving doctors. They may see a doctor as a figure of authority, so tricking these figures of authority, gives them a sense of power and control.\nAnother theory is that Munchausen&#8217;s syndrome is an attempt to form relationships and become more socially acceptable. Many people with Munchausen&#8217;s syndrome are &#8216;loners&#8217;, have little contact with their family, and have few friends. So they then take comfort in adopting the role of a patient, and find the doctor/patient relationship provides a much needed source of human contact and emotional warmth.\nMany people with Munchausen&#8217;s syndrome have claimed to have experienced physical and sexual abuse during childhood. Though due to their tendency to lie about their past, it is hard to say whether this is actually true in all cases.\nDiagnosing Munchausen&#8217;s syndrome can be very challenging for medical professionals. People with the condition are often accomplished liars and are skilled at manipulating and exploiting a doctor&#8217;s concern for their patient, and the doctor&#8217;s natural curiosity in investigating unusual medical conditions.\nIf a health professional does suspect a person may have Munchausen&#8217;s syndrome they will usually make a detailed study of that person&#8217;s health records to look for any inconsistencies between their claimed and actual medical history. They may also attempt to talk to their family and friends to see if their claims about their past are true.\nHealth professionals can also run a number of clinical tests to check for evidence of self-inflicted illness or tampering of clinical test. For example, the person&#8217;s blood can be checked for traces of medication that the person should not be taking, but which could explain their symptoms.\nDoctors will also want to rule out other possible motivations for their behaviour, such as faking illness for financial gain, or because they want access to strong painkillers.\nA diagnosis of Munchausen&#8217;s syndrome can usually be confidently made if there is:\n- clear evidence of fabricating or inducing symptoms\n- the person prime motivation is to be seen as sick\n- there is no other likely reason or explanation for their behaviour\nAs mentioned, treating Munchausen&#8217;s syndrome can be very difficult as most people with the condition will refuse to admit they have a problem and will not co-operate with suggested treatment plans.\nBecause of this, some experts have suggested that health professionals adopt a gentle, non-confrontational approach. So rather than directly accuse a person of lying, they may gently suggest that they have complex health needs that may benefit from a referral to a psychiatrist. Still, even with this approach, many people refuse, or simply move to another area.\nFor people who do admit they have a problem, and co-operate with treatment, it may be possible to help them control the symptoms of Munchausen&#8217;s syndrome.\nThere is no standard treatment for the condition, but a combination of psychoanalysis and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)&nbsp;has proved relatively successful in helping people control their symptoms.\nPsychoanalysis is a type of psychotherapy that is based on the theories of Sigmund Freud. Freud suggested that unconscious beliefs or motivations, often formed during early childhood, can lay at the root of many psychological conditions. Psychoanalysis attempts to uncover and then resolve these unconscious beliefs and motivations.\nCBT works by helping people to identify any unhelpful and unrealistic beliefs and behavioural patterns they may have. The therapist then shows them ways in which they can replace these beliefs with more realistic and balanced ones."

        "disease": "Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) or chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)",
        "description": "Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) or chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a long term (chronic) neurological condition that affects the nervous and immune systems.\nPeople with ME/CFS experience severe pain and fatigue associated with post-exertional malaise (PEM). This is when the body is not able to recover after using even small amounts of energy. This fatigue feels very different from ordinary tiredness. It might take a day or 2 to kick in after physical, mental, or emotional exertion.\nME/CFS affects more women than men, can affect children and adults of all ages and from all social and ethnic groups. It doesn&#8217;t go away with sleep or rest and affects everyday life. It can&nbsp;sometimes be diagnosed as post viral fatigue syndrome (PVFS).\nThe symptoms of&nbsp;the condition vary from person to person. There may be times when your symptoms improve and you&#8217;ll be able to do some normal everyday activities. At other times, symptoms may get worse, affecting your daily life.\nIf you experience new symptoms, talk to your GP or specialist as the new symptoms may be unrelated to ME/CFS. Women often find that symptoms worsen at different times in their menstrual cycle. Not everyone will experience all of the symptoms.\nPeople with ME/CFS experience severe pain, fatigue and a range of other symptoms associated with PEM. This is the body and brain’s inability to recover after using even small amounts of energy.\nSimple physical or mental activities, or combinations of activities, can leave people with ME/CFS feeling completely exhausted. It can also lead to an increase in other symptoms.\nOther symptoms of ME/CFS include:\n- feeling generally unwell\n- pain\n- broken sleep\n- problems with concentration, thinking and memory (‘brain fog’)\n- speech and language problems, including word-finding difficulties\n- poor temperature control\n- dizziness\n- being very sensitive to light and sound\n- nausea\n- loss of appetite\n- muscle pain (myalgia)\nRead more about the symptoms of ME/CFS\nFrustration, anxiety, low mood and depression are sometimes experienced by people with ME/CFS because of the impact of the condition and its symptoms on their lives. This does not mean that ME/CFS is a mental health condition.\nFurther research is needed to confirm what causes ME/CFS. There might be various factors involved and there may be a number of different types of the illness. These different sub-groups still need more research to be identified, including how they lead to different experiences of the condition and how it develops.\nME/CFS may appear suddenly or more slowly over time. It may follow an infection, typically, but not always, viral.\nOther possible triggers can be:\n- trauma\n- surgery\n- stressful major life events\nIn some cases, there may be no identifiable trigger.\nThere&#8217;s no single test to detect ME/CFS. A diagnosis is made after other possible known causes for symptoms have been excluded.\nThe earlier the illness is recognised, the sooner you can get help to manage your symptoms. Many people with ME/CFS find it helps to keep a diary of their symptoms so that they can take this to their GP or specialist.\nYour GP will usually:\n- do a physical and mental examination to rule out other conditions\n- ask about recent travel, tick or insect bites, unusual infections, and drug and alcohol use\n- review current medication\n- arrange tests\nThey may be able to make a diagnosis after 3 or 4 months of seeing a pattern of symptoms. Anyone suspected of having ME/CFS should be considered for routine blood tests to identify other possible illnesses. More investigation may be needed if the diagnosis remains in doubt.\nSome people with ME/CFS also have another long-term condition and it&#8217;s important that you talk to your GP about how to manage the symptoms of the 2 conditions.\nAlthough there&#8217;s no cure for ME/CFS, there are ways to help manage your symptoms.\nBecause of the complexity of the illness different things work for different people. Your GP may be able to support you through managing your individual symptoms.\nTo decide what treatment is right for you, you should look at the evidence, including published research and patient surveys. Make sure you fully understand what the treatment involves before you make a decision. You have the right to decline any treatment option you do not feel comfortable with.\nYour GP may suggest some of the following treatment options.\nYour GP may suggest reviewing and changing the medicines you take. They&#8217;ll consider other conditions you may already be receiving treatment for alongside the most important ME/CFS symptoms that need to be treated.\nYour GP may also need to consider the combined impact of medication for symptoms and possibly for managing other conditions, especially as sensitivity to medicine is a feature of ME/CFS. This could mean there may be issues around polypharmacy (use of many medications) for your healthcare professional to consider.\nYour illness might make it more difficult for you to eat the right balance of nutrients in your diet due to loss of appetite and food intolerances. Your GP may be able to advise you on how you can alter and adjust your diet.\nYour GP may work with you or refer you to another therapist to suggest aids, activities or support that can help you to recover or adjust.\nBalancing periods of activity and rest and noticing what activities demand most from you, can allow you to reduce the number of episodes of PEM.\nPacing yourself involves stopping activities before you feel the impact so that you have energy in reserve. It’s easy to do too much on a good day and then feel the impact later. It can take time to change your habits and stop doing something even while things are going well. However, doing this is key to managing your condition in the long term.\nCounselling can support you to adjust to the impact ME/CFS can have on your life. This does not mean that the condition itself is psychological.\nCBT should only be delivered by a healthcare professional with the right training and experience in CBT for ME/CFS. The 2021 NICE guidelines suggest that CBT might help some people with ME/CFS manage their symptoms.\nCBT can sometimes be used to help changes in mood that can come with having a long-term condition.\nAlternative or holistic therapies may provide some comfort but be cautious of any method that claims to offer a cure for ME/CFS.\nYou should discuss any alternative or holistic therapy with your GP before you try it. Until further research is done, no one can be certain whether someone with ME/CFS might benefit from alternative therapies.\nThere are some things that you can do for yourself to help you manage the condition. Small changes make a difference to your energy and mobility. This is called self-management.\nTo help with this, you might try:\nRecord what you do so that you can build a picture of what uses more energy and what activities you can ask others to do for you. This will show you if there are patterns of symptoms and when they appear during your day.\nThis is very important for managing ME/CFS. You may need some support and advice on what that might mean for you in terms of your physical, mental and emotional activities for resting.\nBeing open with people and asking for help when you need it before you&#8217;re exhausted is a key approach to managing your condition. Talking about how you&#8217;re feeling is important for long term health conditions because of the impact your symptoms have on the way you live your life. Talk to your GP about emotional support available to you.\nNot everyone will experience the same symptoms so it’s important not to compare people with ME/CFS. People with ME/CFS can have very different experiences of the condition and how long their symptoms last.\nThe impact of symptoms can be:\n- mild\n- moderate\n- severe\n- very severe\nAs symptoms change over time so does the impact they have on people’s lives.\nMost people with ME/CFS improve over time, although some people don&#8217;t make a full recovery. It&#8217;s also likely there will be periods when symptoms get better or worse. Children and young people with ME/CFS are more likely to recover fully.\nME/CFS can have a significant emotional and financial impact on your life. A lack of understanding and awareness about ME/CFS means patients can experience disbelief, and even discrimination, from friends, family, health and social care professionals and employers.\nInformation on entitlements to welfare benefits, accessing health and social care and others sources of support for patients and carers are available from Action for M.E. They also offer resources and services for children and young people affected by ME/CFS and their families.\nIn some regions of Scotland there are local support groups providing peer support, information and advice. ALISS and Action for ME can assist with signposting to these groups."

        "disease": "Myasthenia gravis",
        "description": "Myasthenia gravis is a long term (chronic) condition that causes muscle weakness and fatigue.\nIt&#8217;s a rare condition that commonly affects the muscles that control the eyes and eyelids. It can also affect the face, speaking, chewing, swallowing and other parts of the body.\nIt can affect people at any age, but is most often found in women under 40 and men over 60.\nThere are other rarer types of myasthenia which you can read about on myaware.\nIf you drive, you must inform the DVLA that you have myasthenia gravis.\nThe first symptoms of myasthenia gravis are often droopy eyelids or double vision. It usually affects the eyes first and may spread to other parts of the body. It can take weeks, months or years for symptoms to develop in other parts of the body.\nThe severity of the symptoms is different for each person. It&#8217;s likely that your symptoms will tend to get worse when you&#8217;re tired. The symptoms might improve after resting.\nSymptoms can include:\nYou might experience droopy eyelids affecting one or both eyes, and double vision.\nIn some people, only the eye muscles are affected (ocular myasthenia).\nIn most people, the symptoms will spread to affect other parts of the body over time.\nYou might experience:\n- slurred speech\n- difficulty swallowing\n- difficulty making facial expressions like smiling\n- problems with chewing\n- a change in your voice\n- choking or accidentally inhaling food which can cause chest infections\n- shortness of breath\nThe muscle weakness might spread to other parts of the body like your arms, legs and neck.\nYou might experience:\n- weakness in your arms, legs, neck or other parts of your body\n- difficulty holding your head up\n- aching muscles\n- problems with tasks like climbing stairs or washing your hair\nSome people can experience severe breathing and swallowing difficulties, which require immediate hospital treatment. This is called a myasthenic crisis.\nIt&#8217;s possible for patients to experience a myasthenic crisis before they know they have myasthenia gravis.\nYou might need emergency hospital treatment.\nYou should avoid activities that could become dangerous if you experience sudden weakness, like swimming alone.\nIt can be difficult to diagnose myasthenia gravis. Your doctor will ask about your medical history and symptoms.\nYou might need several tests to rule out other causes of your symptoms before you can be diagnosed with myasthenia gravis.\nA blood test will look for a high level of antibodies (made by your immune system) which might be causing myasthenia gravis.\nYou might be offered another blood test at a later date if your initial blood test is normal but you continue to experience worsening symptoms.\nYou might have electromyography (an EMG) to test your nerves and muscles.\nDuring electromyography, you&#8217;ll have small needles inserted into your muscles to measure their electric activity. These are usually inserted around your eyes, forehead or arms.\nThe test will measure the signals from the nerves to the muscles. If the test detects a disruption in the signals, this might be a sign of myasthenia gravis.\nYou might have a computerised tomography (CT) scan to check if the thymus gland in your chest is bigger than expected or has grown abnormally (a thymoma).\nThe thymus gland is part of your immune system. Problems with the thymus gland like inflammation (swelling), can be linked to myasthenia gravis.\nAn magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan might be used to check if your symptoms are being caused by an issue in your brain.\nThere are treatments available that can help reduce the affects of your symptoms.\nIf your symptoms get worse following certain triggers, you should try to avoid those triggers as much as possible.\nTriggers might include:\n- stress\n- tiredness\n- infections\n- medicines\n- surgery\nTreatment might include:&nbsp;\nSometimes myasthenia gravis can be treated with pyridostigmine alone. It works by temporarily improving the nerve to muscle transmission to help muscle strength.\nIt can reduce muscle weakness and for some people this is the only medication they need to control the condition.\nIt&#8217;s effects do not last long and it needs to be taken periodically throughout the day to give the best results.\nSide effects can include stomach upset, diarrhoea and drooling.\nYou might be advised to take steroid tablets like prednisolone if pyridostigmine isn&#8217;t helping.\nSteroid tablets work by reducing the activity of your immune system to stop it attacking the communication between your nerves and muscles.\nIt&#8217;s likely you&#8217;ll be advised to take the tablets every other day. You&#8217;re likely to start at a low dose which will be built up quickly. This might gradually be reduced once your symptoms are under control. It&#8217;s important that you do not stop your steroids suddenly, as this can make you very ill.\nUsing steroids long term can cause side effects including osteoporosis (weak bones), weight gain, infection and diabetes.\nRead more about the side effects of steroids\nImmunosuppressants work by reducing the activity of your immune system. Your healthcare team might suggest taking immunosuppressants if:\n- steroids aren&#8217;t controlling your symptoms\n- you need a high dose of steroids to control your symptoms\nCommonly used immunosuppressants include azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil and methotrexate.\nYou&#8217;ll need to take the tablets every day and it can take at least 9 months to feel the full effect. You&#8217;ll be advised to take steroids at first.\nImmunosuppressants night cause side effects like:\n- loss of appetite and tiredness\n- feeling sick\n- increased risk of infections\nYou&#8217;ll have regular blood tests to check the the medicine isn&#8217;t causing any harm.\nYou might be able to stop taking immunosuppressants if they keep your symptoms under control over a few years.\nYour healthcare team might recommend surgery to remove the thymus gland (thymectomy).\nSymptoms should improve within the first few months after surgery and can continue to improve for up to 2 years.\nSurgery can reduce:\n- the dose of steroids\n- the need to take other immunosuppressants\n- the chances of needing to go to hospital because of worsening symptoms\nSurgery might not help myasthenia symptoms in someone that has a thymoma. Your healthcare team might still recommend having your thymus gland removed because it can cause problems if it keeps growing.\nYour thymectomy will usually be carried out through keyhole surgery. The thymus is removed using surgical instruments inserted through small cuts (incisions) in the chest.\nPlasma exchange and IVIG (intravenous immunoglobulin) can offer a quick improvement (within a few days) for people with myasthenia gravis who are particularly unwell or are having a myasthenic crisis.\nPlasma exchange is an emergency treatment that removes antibodies from your own blood. This treatment is given in hospital and the benefits can last around 6 weeks.\nIVIG treatment involves an injection of normal antibodies from donated blood to temporarily change the way your immune system works.\nThe two treatments are similar and your healthcare team will decide which is the best option for you. Although the benefits only last a few weeks, it can give time for the longer term treatments to take effect and help improve symptoms.\nYou might find that, during pregnancy or after having a baby, your myasthenia gravis worsens. If you&#8217;re planning a pregnancy or become pregnant, you should speak to your healthcare team. Don&#8217;t stop taking your medications without first speaking to your healthcare professional."

        "disease": "Nasal and sinus cancer",
        "description": "Nasal and sinus cancer affects the nasal cavity (the space behind your nose) and the sinuses (small, air-filled cavities inside your nose, cheekbones and forehead).\nIt&#8217;s a rare type of cancer that most often affects men aged 50&nbsp;to 60.\nNasal and sinus cancer is different to cancer in the area where the nose and throat connect. This is called nasopharyngeal cancer.\nThe most common symptoms of nasal and sinus cancer are:\n- a persistent blocked nose, which usually only affects 1 side\n- nosebleeds\n- mucus draining from the nose, which may be blood-stained\n- a decreased sense of smell\nThese symptoms can be similar to more common and less serious conditions, such as&nbsp;a cold or sinusitis.\nAt a later stage, symptoms can include:\n- pain or numbness in the face\n- swollen glands in the neck\n- partial loss of vision or&nbsp;double vision\n- a bulging or persistently watering eye\n- a lump or growth on your&nbsp;face, nose or roof of&nbsp;your mouth\nSpeak to your GP if you notice any unusual or persistent symptoms. They&#8217;re very unlikely to be caused by&nbsp;nasal or sinus cancer, but are worth getting checked out.\nIf your GP thinks you might need some tests to determine what&#8217;s causing your symptoms, you&#8217;ll usually be referred to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) consultant in hospital.\nTests you may have include:\n- a nasal&nbsp;endoscopy –&nbsp;where a long, thin, flexible tube attached to a light source is inserted into your nose to examine the area\n- a computerised tomography (CT) scan&nbsp;and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan\n- a&nbsp;biopsy (where a small sample of tissue is removed and examined) – this may be done during an endoscopy or&nbsp;using a needle\nSeveral factors are known to increase the risk of developing nasal and sinus cancer, including:\n- your gender – men are more likely to develop nasal and sinus cancer than women\n- prolonged exposure to certain substances through your work, including wood dust, leather dust, nickel, chromium and formaldehyde\n- smoking – the more you smoke, the higher your risk of developing several types of cancer, including nasal and sinus cancer\n- human papilloma virus (HPV) – a group of viruses that affect the skin and moist membranes, such as the mouth and throat\nThe best treatment depends on several factors, including how far the cancer has spread and your general health.\nTreatment may include:\n- surgery to remove a tumour –&nbsp;which can be performed using surgical incisions (open surgery) or as keyhole surgery through the nose (endoscopic microsurgery)\n- radiotherapy&nbsp;–&nbsp;where&nbsp;high-energy radiation is used&nbsp;to kill the cancerous cells, shrink a tumour before surgery, or destroy small amounts of a tumour that may be left after surgery\n- chemotherapy&nbsp;–&nbsp;where medicine is used&nbsp;to help shrink or slow down the growth of a tumour, or to reduce the risk of the cancer returning after surgery\nYour treatment&nbsp;will be organised by a head and neck cancer multidisciplinary team (MDT), who will discuss the treatment options with you.&nbsp;A combination of treatments will often be recommended."

        "disease": "Nasopharyngeal cancer",
        "description": "Nasopharyngeal cancer is a rare type of cancer that affects the part of the throat connecting the back of the nose to the back of the mouth (the pharynx).\nNasopharyngeal cancer shouldn’t be confused with other types of cancer that also affect the throat, such as&nbsp;laryngeal cancer&nbsp;and&nbsp;oesophageal cancer.\nIt’s often difficult to recognise nasopharyngeal cancer because the symptoms are similar to other, less serious conditions. Also, many people with nasopharyngeal cancer don’t have any symptoms until the cancer reaches an advanced stage.\nSymptoms of nasopharyngeal cancer can include:\n- a&nbsp;lump in the neck\n- hearing loss&nbsp;– usually only in 1 ear\n- tinnitus&nbsp;– hearing sounds that come&nbsp;from inside the body rather than from an outside source\n- a blocked or stuffy nose\n- nosebleeds\nSpeak to your GP if you develop any worrying symptoms, particularly if they don’t improve after&nbsp;a few weeks. While they’re very unlikely to be caused by nasopharyngeal cancer, it’s best to get them checked out.\nThe exact cause of nasopharyngeal cancer is unknown, but&nbsp;a number of factors can increase your risk of developing the condition. These include:\n- being of south Chinese or north African descent\n- having a diet very high in salt-cured meats and fish\n- being exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a common virus that causes&nbsp;glandular fever\n- having a job where you’re regularly exposed to hardwood dust\n- having a first-degree relative, such as a parent, who’s had the condition\nBeing exposed to the&nbsp;human papilloma virus (HPV)&nbsp;may also increase your risk of developing certain types of nasopharyngeal cancer.\nAbout 3 times as many men as women are affected by nasopharyngeal cancer. The average age at diagnosis is about 50.\nIf you see your GP with symptoms that could indicate nasopharyngeal cancer, they’ll usually ask about your symptoms and carry out some examinations. This may involve examining your throat using a small mirror and a light.\nIf your GP thinks further tests are necessary, they’ll refer you to hospital. At hospital, a number of different tests may be carried out to check for nasopharyngeal cancer and rule out other conditions.\nSome of the tests you may have include:\n- a nasendoscopy –&nbsp;where a thin, flexible telescope (endoscope)&nbsp;is inserted up your nose and passed down your throat to look for any abnormalities; it’s carried out while you’re awake, but&nbsp;local anaesthetic&nbsp;can be used to numb your nose and throat\n- imaging scans –&nbsp;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans&nbsp;or&nbsp;computerised tomography (CT) scans&nbsp;can be used to check for tumours and determine whether the cancer has spread\n- a panendoscopy –&nbsp;a more detailed examination of your nose and throat carried out under&nbsp;general anaesthetic&nbsp;(where you’re unconscious) using a series of small, rigid telescopes connected together\n- a&nbsp;biopsy&nbsp;–&nbsp;where a small tissue sample is removed during a panendoscopy so it can be examined in a laboratory\nOnce these tests are complete, your doctors will be able to confirm whether you have nasopharyngeal cancer. They’ll also be able to ‘stage’ the cancer, which means giving it a score to describe how large it is and how far it has spread.\nThe Cancer Research UK website has more information about&nbsp;the stages of nasopharyngeal cancer.\nIf you’re diagnosed with nasopharyngeal cancer, you’ll be cared for by a team of different specialists who work together called a multidisciplinary team (MDT). Members of your MDT will discuss with you what they think the best treatment option is in your case.\nThe 2 main treatments for nasopharyngeal cancer are:\n- radiotherapy – where&nbsp;radiation&nbsp;is used to kill cancer cells\n- chemotherapy – where medication is used to kill cancer cells\nIn most cases, a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy will be used.\nSurgery isn’t usually used to treat nasopharyngeal cancer as it’s difficult for surgeons to access the affected area.\nRadiotherapy is the most commonly used treatment for nasopharyngeal cancer. It can be used on its own to treat very early-stage cancers, or in combination with chemotherapy for more advanced cancers.\nIn most cases, external radiotherapy is used. This involves using a machine to focus high-energy radiation beams on to the area that requires treatment.\nIn nasopharyngeal cancer, an advanced form of external radiotherapy called intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is used.\nIt&nbsp;involves aiming radiation beams of different strengths at a tumour from several different angles. This helps maximise the dose delivered to the tumour, while minimising the effect on the surrounding healthy tissue.\nStereotactic radiotherapy is another way of giving radiotherapy externally and may be used to target a specific area where the cancer has returned.\nExternal radiotherapy is often given in short sessions, once a day from Monday to Friday, with a break at weekends. This is usually carried out for up to&nbsp;7 weeks. You won’t need to stay in hospital overnight between&nbsp;these appointments.\nIn some cases, internal radiotherapy may be required&nbsp;where nasopharyngeal cancer has returned after initial treatment. A radioactive source is placed into or near the cancerous area and left in place for anywhere from a few minutes to a few days.\nDepending on the type of treatment you have, you may need to stay in hospital for a short period of time.\nRadiotherapy itself is painless, but it can have some significant side effects, such as:\n- red and sore&nbsp;skin in the treatment area\n- feeling sick\n- changes to your sense of taste\n- dry mouth&nbsp;\n- hair loss\nThese side effects are usually temporary, but some can be permanent. Let your care team know if you experience these problems as treatment is often available to help.\nRead more about&nbsp;how radiotherapy is performed&nbsp;and the&nbsp;side effects of radiotherapy\nChemotherapy&nbsp;may be used before or alongside radiotherapy for more advanced nasopharyngeal cancers.\nIt’s usually given through a drip into a vein (intravenous chemotherapy), with sessions every 3 to 4 weeks spread over several months. You won’t usually need to stay in hospital&nbsp;overnight&nbsp;during treatment.\nLike radiotherapy, chemotherapy can cause a number of significant side effects, such as:\n- feeling sick\n- diarrhoea\n- sore mouth\n- tiredness\nThese side effects are usually temporary, but there’s also a risk of longer-term problems, such as infertility.&nbsp;You should discuss any concerns you have about the potential side effects of treatment with your care team before treatment begins.\nRead more about&nbsp;how chemotherapy is performed&nbsp;and the&nbsp;side effects of chemotherapy\nAfter your course of treatment ends, you’ll need to have regular follow-up appointments and scans to monitor your recovery and check for any signs of the cancer returning.\nTo start with, these appointments will be every few weeks or months, but they’ll become gradually less frequent over time."

        "disease": "Neck problems",
        "description": "This information may be useful for those who have a new neck problem. People who have been diagnosed with a neck condition or have had recent neck surgery should follow the advice of their healthcare professional.\nNeck problems can cause a range of symptoms including:\n- pain (which may go down your arm)\n- stiffness\n- pins and needles or numbness in your arm or hand\nIn many cases, new or flare-up of long-standing neck problems should begin to settle within 6 weeks without the need to see a healthcare professional.\nNeck problems are normally caused by an accident or normal age-related changes. They can also start for no obvious reason.\nNeck problems are rarely due to any serious disease or damage.\nOften neck problems can be accompanied by pain in your upper back or arms.\nPain sensations can include hot, burning, shooting, or stabbing pain in your shoulders or into one or both of your arms.\nNeck pain can also cause headaches.\nThere are a number of things you can do to help your neck problem.\nKeeping your neck moving is an essential part of your treatment and recovery.\nAfter a neck problem you should:\n- keep moving, even if you move slowly at first\n- move your neck for short periods every hour\n- change positions regularly where ever you are &#8211; try to find a position that reduces any pains you may have in your neck and/or arm(s)\n- try to stay active but remember not to carry out activities which aggravate any pains you may have in your neck and/or arm(s)\n- do whatever you normally would and stay at, or return to work &#8211; this is important and the best way to get better\n- try to use one supportive pillow as too many can put strain on your neck\nUse of a collar isn&#8217;t recommended.\nKeeping active&#8217;s the single best thing you can do for your general health.\nBeing physically active can:\n- maintain your current levels of fitness – even if you have to modify what you normally do, any activity is better than none\n- keep your other muscles and joints strong and flexible\n- prevent a recurrence of the problem\n- help you aim for a healthy body weight\nAvoid sports or heavy lifting until you have less discomfort and good movement. Remember to warm up before sports.\nIt&#8217;s beneficial to do specific exercises that can help in your recovery. They may be challenging at the beginning so just do what you can and try to build it up over time.\nExercises to help with neck problems\nThe following can help to reduce the pain:\n- pain medication &#8211; this can help you move more comfortably, which can help your recovery\n- heat or ice packs\nMore about taking painkillers.\nRemember to never place ice or heat directly on your skin. Use a barrier, such as a towel, to protect your skin from a burn. How long you use ice as a treatment can depend on the painful area but generally up to 15 minutes leaving a few hours between treatments.\nYou should stop treating the area with ice or heat and seek advice from a medical professional if you notice an increase in redness, discolouration or blistering of the skin.\nIf you have any issues with circulation or sensation, you shouldn&#8217;t use ice or heat as a treatment for neck pain.\nIt’s easy to start worrying about all the possible things that could be wrong, but research has shown that most neck pain settles with time.\nKeeping as active as possible helps you to cope better and get back to your usual activities more quickly.\nIt&#8217;s recommended you stay at or return to work as quickly as possible during your recovery. This is important and usually the best way to get better. You don&#8217;t need to be pain and symptom-free to return to work.\nYou should speak to your employer to see if you need any workplace adjustments.\nFollowing this advice, you should see gradual improvements over time.\nYou should see the biggest change in your symptoms within the first couple of weeks. Most problems should have improved within 6 weeks.\nIf your neck problem hasn’t improved within 6 weeks of following this advice, it’s a good idea to talk to a healthcare professional about your symptoms.\nFind out how to access MSK services in your area."

        "disease": "Neuroblastoma: Children",
        "description": "Most children who have neuroblastoma are younger than 5 years old. It’s&nbsp;the most common solid tumour in children that occurs outside of the brain and makes up 8% of the total number of children’s cancers.\nMore children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.\nIt’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer. At times it can feel overwhelming, but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.\nUnderstanding more about the cancer your child has, and the treatments that may be used, can often help parents to cope. Your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information and, if you have any questions, it’s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.\nNeuroblastoma develops from the cells left behind from a baby’s development in the womb. The cells that it develops from are called neuroblasts.\n- ‘Neuro’ means nerve\n- ‘Blast’ means cells in early development\n- ‘Oma’ means a group of cells, or a tumour\nNeuroblastoma can occur anywhere in the body. The site of origin is either in 1 of the 2 adrenal glands situated in the abdomen (tummy) or in nerve tissue that runs alongside the spinal cord, in the neck, chest, abdomen or pelvis. The adrenal glands are specialised glands that are found above the right and left kidney. The adrenal glands normally release hormones to maintain blood pressure, and enable us to respond to stress. In some cases, neuroblastoma can spread to tissues beyond the original site such as the bone marrow, bone, lymph nodes, liver, and skin.\nAs with most cancers, the cause of neuroblastoma is unknown. It is not infectious and cannot be passed on to other people.\nThe symptoms vary, depending on where your child’s neuroblastoma tumour is:\n- if the tumour is in the abdomen, your child’s tummy may be swollen and they may complain of constipation or have difficulty passing urine (peeing)\n- if the tumour affects the chest area, your child may be breathless and have difficulty swallowing\n- if the tumour occurs in the neck, it’s often visible as a lump and occasionally affects breathing and swallowing\n- occasionally, there are deposits of neuroblastoma in the skin that appear as small, blue-coloured lumps\n- if the tumour is pressing on the spinal cord, children may have weakness in the legs and walk unsteadily – if your child is not yet walking, you may notice reduced leg movements; they may also have constipation or difficulty passing urine (peeing)\n- your child may be found to have high blood pressure\n- very rarely, children may have jerky eye and muscle movements, and general unsteadiness associated with the neuroblastoma\nThere are often symptoms of tiredness, being pale, loss of appetite, weight loss, bone pain and generalised discomfort.\nA variety of tests and investigations will be needed to diagnose neuroblastoma. These include a biopsy of the tumour, blood and bone marrow tests, X-rays, CT or MRI scans, and a special nuclear medicine scan called an MIBG scan. These tests are carried out to confirm the diagnosis of neuroblastoma, and to find the exact position of the original site of neuroblastoma within the body and to see whether it has spread. This process is known as staging.\nA specific type of urine test will also be done. Nearly all children with neuroblastoma (9 out of 10) will have substances called vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), or homovanillic acid (HVA), in their urine. Measuring the VMA and HVA in the urine can help to confirm the diagnosis. Your child will also have their VMA and HVA levels checked during and after treatment. The levels of these substances will fall if the treatment is working. As these chemicals are produced by the tumour cells, and can be used to measure tumour activity, they are sometimes known as tumour markers.\nMost children will have an MIBG (meta-iodo-benzyl guanidine) scan. MIBG is a substance that’s taken up by neuroblastoma cells. It’s given by injection into the blood stream. Attaching a small amount of radioactive iodine to the MIBG enables any neuroblastoma tissue to be seen by a radiation scanner. Sometimes MIBG can be used as a treatment.\nA small sample of cells (a&nbsp;biopsy) is usually taken from the tumour during an operation under a general anaesthetic. These cells are then examined under a microscope. Other tests collectively referred to as tumour biology, look at the chromosomes and ‘biological markers’ in the tumour cells. One of these ‘markers’ is called MYCN. The presence of a certain amount of MYCN in the cells (known as MYCN amplification) can suggest that the neuroblastoma may be a more aggressive type. In this situation, the treatment needs to be more intensive.\nThe ‘stage’ of a cancer is a term used to describe its size and whether it has spread beyond its original site. Knowing the particular type and stage of the cancer helps the doctors to decide on the best treatment for your child.\nThe cancer is contained within 1 area of the body (localised) and there’s no evidence of it having spread. It can be completely removed by surgery, or there may be very small (microscopic) amounts of tumour left.\nThe cancer is localised and has not begun to spread, but cannot be completely removed by surgery.\nThe cancer is localised and has begun to spread into nearby lymph nodes.\nThe cancer has spread into surrounding organs and structures, but has not spread to distant areas of the body.\nThe cancer has spread to distant lymph nodes, bone, bone marrow, liver, skin or other organs.\nThis stage of neuroblastoma is found in children under 1 year old. The cancer is localised (as in stage 1, 2A or 2B) and has begun to spread to the liver, skin or bone marrow.\nA newer staging system has been developed by the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG). This system is now widely used. It looks at whether or not certain ‘image-defined risk factors’ are present in a neuroblastoma tumour before treatment. These risk factors can be detected by scans and help doctors understand the extent of the disease. Your doctor can explain more about this.\nThe tumour is localised and has not spread into important areas (vital structures) nearby. It can be removed by surgery.\nThe tumour is localised but has ‘image-defined risk factors’ and can’t be safely removed by surgery.\nThe tumour has spread to other parts of the body.\nThe tumour has spread to the skin, liver and/or the bone marrow in children younger than 18 months old.\nIf the cancer has spread to distant parts of the body, this is known as secondary or metastatic cancer. If the cancer comes back after initial treatment, this is known as recurrent or relapsed cancer.\nThe treatment of neuroblastoma depends on the age of the child, the size and position of the tumour, the tumour biology (including the MYCN status) and whether the neuroblastoma has spread.\nFor tumours that have not spread (localised tumours), the treatment is usually surgery. If the tumour is at an early stage and there is no evidence that it has spread to the lymph nodes or any other parts of the body, an operation to remove the tumour, or as much of it as possible, will be undertaken. If the tumour is, at first, too large or in too difficult a position to remove safely, chemotherapy will be given to shrink it before surgery. A cure is usually possible for children with localised tumours. However, if a localised tumour is classed as ‘high-risk’, due to the tumour biology results, additional treatment with chemotherapy and usually radiotherapy will be needed.\nIf the tumour has already spread by the time of diagnosis, or is indicated as being high-risk by the tumour biology result, intensive&nbsp;chemotherapy&nbsp;is needed. Chemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer drugs to destroy cancer cells. It’s usually given as an infusion into a vein. Your child will have a semi-permanent cannula called a central venous line inserted under a general anaesthetic to minimise the distress caused by intravenous injections.\nYour child’s specialist will discuss with you the type and amount of chemotherapy needed.\nIf the neuroblastoma has spread to several parts of the body, or is high-risk with MYCN amplification, high dose chemotherapy with peripheral blood stem cell rescue is used after the initial courses of chemotherapy. High-dose chemotherapy will wipe out any remaining neuroblastoma cells but will also wipe out the body’s bone marrow, where blood cells are made. To prevent the problems this causes, stem cells (blood cells at their earliest stages of development) are collected from your child through a drip before the chemotherapy is given. These stem cells are then frozen and stored until required. After the high-dose chemotherapy, the stem cells are given back to your child through a drip. They make their way into the bone marrow, where they grow and develop into mature blood cells over a period of 14 to 21 days.\nMonoclonal antibodies can destroy some types of cancer cells while causing little harm to normal cells. In the UK, patients with high-risk neuroblastoma treated in the (SIOPEN) European high-risk clinical trial receive immunotherapy with a monoclonal antibody called anti-GD2 after their high dose therapy. There is good evidence from a clinical trial (research study) carried out in America, which was first reported on in 2009, that this may be a promising therapy when given alongside standard treatment for neuroblastoma. The anti GD2 is either given on its own or with cytokines. It is not yet a standard treatment for patients with neuroblastoma as it has very unpleasant side effects, the benefits need to be fully proven and the best way to administer it needs to be established. It is therefore currently only available to patients in the UK who are being treated within a clinical trial. Your child’s specialist will be able to tell you much more about this treatment.\nExternal beam&nbsp;radiotherapy&nbsp;may be given if the neuroblastoma is high-risk, or has spread to several parts of the body. This uses high-energy rays to destroy the cancer cells, while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. External beam radiotherapy is given from a machine outside the body. Internal radiotherapy may sometimes be given using radioactive MIBG. Radioactive MIBG is similar to the MIBG used in an investigation to diagnose neuroblastoma, but uses higher doses of radioactivity to kill the cancer cells.\nChildren under 18 months old with neuroblastoma often have ‘low-risk’ tumours, and as long as there is no MYCN amplification, their outlook is excellent. Most children in this age group are cured.\nChildren with Stage 4S disease almost always get better with very little treatment or none at all. These tumours either regress spontaneously or after chemotherapy, which is only given if there are symptoms from the tumour. They disappear completely or develop into a non-cancerous (benign) tumour, called a ganglioneuroma. Many of these children, after their initial diagnostic tests and staging investigations, will just need careful monitoring for some years. Ganglioneuromas are usually harmless and will not cause any problems and do not need any treatment.\nChemotherapy often causes side effects, and your child’s doctor will discuss this with you before the treatment starts. The side effects will depend upon the actual drugs being given. Immediate side effects can include:\n- feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting)\n- diarrhoea\n- weight loss\n- hair loss\n- increased risk of infection\n- bruising and bleeding\n- tiredness\nA small number of children may develop late side effects, sometimes many years after treatment. These include a change in the way the heart and kidneys work, hearing problems, fertility problems, a possible reduction in bone growth if radiotherapy has been given, and a slightly increased risk of developing another cancer in later life. Your child’s doctor or nurse will talk to you about any possible late side effects.\nMany children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. Specialist doctors organise many trials for children’s cancer. Children in the UK with neuroblastoma can take part in national and European studies. The European research group is called SIOPEN. If appropriate, your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial, and will answer any questions you have. Written information is provided to help explain things. Taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide if it’s right for your child.\nSometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child’s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The&nbsp;Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group&nbsp;(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.\nFollow-up after treatment usually involves regular visits to the hospital outpatients department, with scans and urine tests as necessary. For children who have had chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, more specialised tests may also be carried our. For example, hearing tests, kidney and heart function tests, and checking hormone levels. These will be repeated until your child is grown up. If you have specific concerns about your child’s condition and treatment, it’s best to discuss them with your child’s doctor, who knows their situation in detail.\nAs a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time.\nYour child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer.\nFurther information and advice if your child has cancer"

        "disease": "Neuroendocrine tumours",
        "description": "Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are rare tumours that can occur in the cells of the neuroendocrine system.\nThe neuroendocrine system consists of nerve and gland cells. It produces hormones and releases them into the bloodstream.\nNETs are tumours (abnormal growths) that develop in the cells of the neuroendocrine system.\nNETs can be malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) and often&nbsp;–&nbsp;but not always&nbsp;– grow slowly. There are a number of different types of NET, depending on the specific cells affected.\nGastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP NETs) are tumours that develop in the gut or pancreas.\nGastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumours (GI NETs) develop in the digestive system, which includes the bowel, stomach or oesophagus. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (pNETs) develop in the pancreas.\nPulmonary neuroendocrine tumours develop in the lungs. Rarely, NETs can also develop in other parts of the body, including in the liver, gallbladder, bile ducts, kidneys, ovaries, or testicles.\nSome NETs, known as functioning tumours, produce hormones that cause specific symptoms. Tumours that don’t cause symptoms are known as non-functioning tumours.\nThe symptoms of&nbsp;a&nbsp;neuroendocrine tumour&nbsp;can vary depending on where it is and what hormones it produces.\nFor example,&nbsp;a&nbsp;tumour in the digestive system may cause&nbsp;diarrhoea,&nbsp;constipation&nbsp;or tummy pains. A tumour in the lung may cause wheezing or a persistent&nbsp;cough.\nSome tumours (functioning tumours) may cause abnormally large amounts of hormones to be released into the bloodstream.\nThis can&nbsp;cause symptoms such as diarrhoea, flushing, cramps, wheezing,&nbsp;low blood sugar&nbsp;(hypoglycaemia), changes in blood pressure and heart problems.\nWhat causes neuroendocrine tumours isn’t fully understood. However,&nbsp;your chance of developing a NET is increased&nbsp;if you have one of the following rare conditions or syndromes:\n- multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) –&nbsp;a rare inherited condition where tumours in the endocrine system develop, most commonly in the parathyroid glands, pituitary gland and the pancreas\n- neurofibrmatosis type 1&nbsp;–&nbsp;a group of genetic conditions that cause tumours to grow along your nerves\n- Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL) – an inherited condition that causes blood vessels to grow abnormally\nResearch has also shown that your risk of developing a NET is slightly increased if one of your parents has had one in the past.\nThere are many tests that can&nbsp;be used to diagnose NETs, including&nbsp;blood tests, urine tests, scans, and a&nbsp;biopsy&nbsp;(where a small tissue sample is taken for closer examination).\nDifferent types of scans may also be used to identify or examine tumours. These include:\n- ultrasound scans&nbsp;– including echocardiograms and endoscopic ultrasound scans\n- computerised tomography (CT) scans\n- magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans\n- positron emission tomography (PET) scans\n- octreotide scans&nbsp;– where mild radioactive liquid is injected into your veins and&nbsp;a special camera is used to highlight&nbsp;any cancerous cells\nHow a neuroendocrine tumour is treated will depend on your&nbsp;individual circumstances. For example, your treatment will depend on:\n- where the tumour is\n- how advanced your condition is\n- your overall&nbsp;health\nUnfortunately, many people are only diagnosed after other parts of their body are affected. However, it may still be possible to&nbsp;surgically remove the tumour, even if it has spread to other parts of your body.\nIf surgery can’t be used to completely cure your condition, it may be used to help manage and reduce any symptoms that you have.\nIt may also be possible to shrink the tumour or stop further growth using treatments that block the blood supply to the tumour (embolisation),&nbsp;or&nbsp;chemotherapy,&nbsp;radiotherapy&nbsp;or radiofrequency ablation (where heat is used to destroy the cells).\nThe&nbsp;Cancer Research UK&nbsp;website has more information about&nbsp;neuroendocrine tumours (NETs).\nIf you have&nbsp;neuroendocrine tumours, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).\nThis helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition.

        "disease": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)",
        "description": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the term for a range of conditions caused by a build-up of fat in the liver. It&#8217;s usually seen in people who are overweight or obese.\nA healthy liver should contain little or no fat. It&#8217;s estimated that up to 1 in every&nbsp;3 people in the UK has early stages of NAFLD where there are small amounts of fat in their liver.\nEarly-stage NAFLD doesn&#8217;t usually cause any harm, but it can lead to serious liver damage, including&nbsp;cirrhosis, if it gets worse. Having high levels of fat in your liver is also associated with an increased risk of problems such as diabetes,&nbsp;heart attacks and&nbsp;strokes.\nIf detected and managed at an early stage, it&#8217;s possible to stop NAFLD getting worse and reduce the amount of fat in your liver.\nNAFLD develops in 4&nbsp;main stages.\nMost people will only ever&nbsp;develop the first stage, usually without realising it. In small number of cases it&nbsp;can progress and eventually lead to liver damage if not detected and managed.\nThe main stages of NAFLD are:\nIt can take years for fibrosis or cirrhosis&nbsp;to develop. It&#8217;s important to make lifestyle changes to&nbsp;prevent the disease from getting worse.\nYou&#8217;re at an increased risk of NAFLD if you:\n- are&nbsp;obese or overweight&nbsp;– particularly if you have a lot of fat around your waist (an &#8216;apple-like&#8217; body shape)\n- have&nbsp;type 2 diabetes\n- have&nbsp;high blood pressure\n- have&nbsp;high cholesterol\n- are over the age of 50\n- smoke\nHowever, NAFLD has been diagnosed in people without any of these risk factors, including young children.\nAlthough it&#8217;s very similar to alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD), NAFLD isn&#8217;t caused by drinking too much alcohol.\nThere aren&#8217;t usually any symptoms of NAFLD in the early stages. You probably won&#8217;t know you have it unless it&#8217;s diagnosed during tests carried out for another reason.\nOccasionally, people with NASH or fibrosis (more advanced stages of the disease) may experience:\n- a dull or aching pain in the top right of the&nbsp;tummy (over the lower right side of the ribs)\n- fatigue (extreme tiredness)\n- unexplained weight loss\n- weakness\nIf cirrhosis (the most advanced stage) develops, you can get more severe symptoms such as yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice), itchy skin, and swelling in the legs, ankles, feet&nbsp;or tummy.\nRead more about the symptoms of cirrhosis.\nNAFLD is often diagnosed after&nbsp;a blood test&nbsp;called a&nbsp;liver function test produces an abnormal result and other liver conditions, such as hepatitis, are ruled out. However, blood tests don&#8217;t always pick up NAFLD.\nThe condition may also be spotted during an&nbsp;ultrasound scan of your tummy. This is a type of scan where sound waves are used to create an image of the inside of your body.\nIf you&#8217;re diagnosed with NAFLD, further tests may be needed to determine which stage you have. This may involve a special blood test or having another type of ultrasound scan (Fibroscan). Some people may also need a small sample of liver tissue (biopsy) taken using a needle to have it analysed in a laboratory.\nMost people with NAFLD won&#8217;t develop any serious problems, but if you&#8217;re diagnosed with the condition it&#8217;s a good idea to take steps to stop it getting any worse.\nThere&#8217;s currently no specific medication for NAFLD, but making healthy lifestyle choices can help and treatment may be recommended for associated conditions (high blood pressure, diabetes and cholesterol) or complications.\nYou may be advised to have regular appointments with your&nbsp;doctor to check your liver function and&nbsp;look for signs of any new problems.\nAdopting a healthy lifestyle is the main way of managing NAFLD.&nbsp;The following can all&nbsp;help.&nbsp;\nLose weight – you should aim for a&nbsp;BMI of 18.5-24.9. Losing more than 10% of your weight can remove some fat from the liver and improve NASH if you have it.\nEat a healthy diet – try to have a&nbsp;balanced diet&nbsp;high in fruits, vegetables, protein and carbohydrates, but low in fat, sugar and salt. Eating smaller portions of food can help too.\nExercise&nbsp;regularly – aim to do at least 150 minutes of&nbsp;moderate-intensity activity, such as walking or cycling, a week. All types of exercise can help improve NAFLD, even if you don&#8217;t lose weight.\nStop smoking&nbsp;– if you smoke, stopping can help reduce your risk of problems such as heart attacks and strokes.\nNAFLD isn&#8217;t caused by alcohol, but&nbsp;drinking may make the condition worse. It&#8217;s therefore advisable to cut down or stop drinking alcohol. Read some tips on cutting down on alcohol.\nThere isn&#8217;t currently any medication that can treat NAFLD, but&nbsp;various medicines can be useful in managing the problems associated with the condition.\nFor example, your doctor may recommend medication to treat high blood pressure, treat high cholesterol, treat type 2 diabetes&nbsp;and/or treat obesity.\nIf you develop&nbsp;severe cirrhosis and your&nbsp;liver stops working properly, you may need to be put on the waiting list for a liver transplant.\nFor adults,&nbsp;the average waiting time for a liver transplant is 145 days for transplants from recently deceased donors.\nAlternatively, it may be possible to have a transplant using&nbsp;a section of liver&nbsp;removed from a living donor. As&nbsp;the liver can regenerate itself, both the transplanted section and the remaining section of the donor&#8217;s liver are able to regrow to a normal size.\nRead more about&nbsp;liver transplants.&nbsp;"

        "disease": "Non-Hodgkin lymphoma",
        "description": "Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is an uncommon cancer that develops in the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout your body.\nThe lymphatic system is part of your immune system. Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes.\nIn non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the affected lymphocytes start to multiply in an abnormal way and begin to collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes (glands). The affected lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection.\nThe most common symptom of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin.\nRead more about the symptoms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.&nbsp;\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma can occur at any age, but your chances of developing the condition increase as you get older, with most cases diagnosed in people over 65. Slightly more men than women are affected.\nThe exact cause of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is unknown. However, your risk of developing the condition is increased if you:\n- have a medical condition that weakens your immune system\n- take immunosuppressant medication\n- have previously been exposed to a common virus called the Epstein-Barr virus – which causes glandular fever\nYou also have a slightly increased risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma if a first-degree relative (such as a parent or sibling) has had the condition.\nRead more about the causes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nThe only way to confirm a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is by carrying out a biopsy.\nThis is a minor surgical procedure where a sample of affected lymph node tissue is removed and studied in a laboratory.\nRead more about diagnosing non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nThere are many subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but they can generally be put into one of 2 broad categories:\n- high-grade or aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma – where the cancer develops quickly and aggressively\n- low-grade or indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma – where the cancer develops slowly, and you may not experience any symptoms for many years\nThe outlook&nbsp;for non-Hodgkin lymphoma varies greatly, depending on the exact type,&nbsp;grade and extent of the lymphoma, and the person’s age.\nLow-grade tumours don&#8217;t necessarily require immediate medical treatment, but are harder to completely cure. High-grade lymphomas need to be treated straight away, but tend to respond much better to treatment and can often be cured.&nbsp;\nThe main treatments used for non-Hodgkin lymphoma are:\n- chemotherapy\n- radiotherapy&nbsp;\n- a&nbsp;type of targeted treatment called monoclonal antibody therapy\nOverall, most cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma are considered very treatable. You can read more detailed information about&nbsp;the outlook for non-Hodgkin lymphoma on the Cancer Research UK website.\nHowever, there&#8217;s a risk of long-term problems after treatment, including infertility and an increased risk of developing another type of cancer in the future.\nRead more about:&nbsp;\n- treating non-Hodgkin lymphoma&nbsp;\n- complications of non-Hodgkin lymphoma\nIf you have&nbsp;non-Hodgkin lymphoma, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).\nThis helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.\nFind out more about the register.\nThe most common symptom of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin.\nLymph nodes, also known as lymph glands,&nbsp;are pea-sized lumps of tissue found throughout the body. They&nbsp;contain white blood cells that help to fight against infection.\nThe swelling is caused by a certain type of white blood cell,&nbsp;known as&nbsp;lymphocytes,&nbsp;collecting in&nbsp;the lymph node.\nHowever, it&#8217;s highly unlikely you have non-Hodgkin lymphoma if you have swollen lymph nodes, as these glands often swell as a response to infection.\nSome people with non-Hodgkin lymphoma also have other more general symptoms. These can include:\n- night sweats\n- unintentional weight loss&nbsp;\n- a high temperature (fever)\n- a persistent&nbsp;cough or feeling of&nbsp;breathlessness\n- persistent itching of the skin all over the body\nOther symptoms depend on where in the body the enlarged lymph glands are. For example, if the abdomen (tummy) is affected, you may have abdominal pain or indigestion.\nA few people with lymphoma have abnormal cells in their bone marrow when they&#8217;re diagnosed. This may lead to:\n- persistent tiredness or fatigue\n- an increased risk of infections\n- excessive bleeding – such as nosebleeds,&nbsp;heavy periods and spots of blood under the skin\nSpeak to your GP if you have any of these symptoms, particularly if you have persistently swollen glands with no other signs of infection.\nWhile the symptoms are unlikely to be caused by non-Hodgkin lymphoma, it&#8217;s best to get them checked out.\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma is caused by a change (mutation) in the DNA of a type of white blood cell called lymphocytes. The exact reason why this happens isn&#8217;t known.\nDNA gives cells a basic set of instructions, such as when to grow and reproduce. The mutation in the DNA changes these instructions, so the cells keep growing. This causes them to multiply uncontrollably.\nThe abnormal&nbsp;lymphocytes&nbsp;usually begin to multiply in one or more lymph nodes in a particular area of the body, such as your neck or groin. Over time, it&#8217;s possible for the abnormal lymphocytes to spread into other parts of your body, such as your:\n- bone marrow\n- spleen\n- liver\n- skin\n- lungs\nHowever, in some cases, non-Hodgkin lymphoma first develops in an organ or&nbsp;somewhere else outside the lymphatic system (the network of lymph vessels and glands found throughout&nbsp;the body).\nWhile the cause of the initial mutation that triggers non-Hodgkin lymphoma is unknown, a number of factors can increase your risk of developing the condition. These include:\n- having a medical condition that weakens your immune system, such as HIV\n- having medical treatment that weakens your immune system – for example, taking medication to suppress your immune system after an organ transplant\n- having an autoimmune condition (a condition caused by problems with the immune system), such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus or Sjogren&#8217;s syndrome\n- being previously exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus – a common virus that causes glandular fever\n- being previously exposed to the Human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV)\n- having a Helicobacter pylori infection – a common bacterial infection that usually infects the lining of the stomach and small intestine\n- having received chemotherapy or radiotherapy for an earlier cancer\n- having&nbsp;coeliac disease – an adverse reaction to gluten that causes inflammation of the small bowel\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma isn&#8217;t infectious and isn&#8217;t thought to run in families, although your risk may be slightly increased if a first-degree relative (such as a parent or sibling) has had lymphoma.\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma can occur at any age, but most cases are diagnosed in people over 65. The condition is slightly more common in men than women.\nIf you see your GP because you&#8217;re concerned about symptoms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, they&#8217;ll ask about your health and carry out a simple physical examination.\nIf necessary, your GP will refer you to hospital for further tests.\nIn 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and refer people for the right tests faster.\nTo find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected&nbsp;non-Hodgkin lymphoma, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral.\nIf you&#8217;re referred to hospital, a biopsy will usually be carried out, as this is the only way to confirm a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nA biopsy involves removing some or all of an affected lymph node, which is then studied in a laboratory.\nBiopsies are small operations that can often be carried out under a local anaesthetic&nbsp;(where the area is numbed). In some cases,&nbsp;the affected lymph node isn&#8217;t easily accessible and a general anaesthetic may be required (where you&#8217;re asleep).\nA pathologist (an expert in the study of diseased tissue) will then check the tissue sample for the presence of cancerous cells. If they find cancerous cells, they can also identify exactly which type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma you have, which is an important factor in planning your treatment.\nThere are more than 30 types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, including:\n- diffuse large B-cell lymphoma\n- follicular lymphoma\n- extranodal marginal zone B-cell (MALT)\n- mantle cell lymphoma\n- Burkitt lymphoma\n- mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma\n- nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma\n- small lymphocytic lymphoma\n- lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma&nbsp;\n- peripheral T-cell lymphoma\n- skin (cutaneous) lymphomas\n- anaplastic large-cell lymphoma\n- lymphoblastic lymphoma\nThe Macmillan Cancer Support website has more detailed information on the different types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nIf a biopsy confirms a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, further testing will be required to check how far the lymphoma has spread. This allows a doctor to diagnose the stage of your lymphoma.\nFurther tests may include:\n- blood tests – samples of blood will be taken throughout your diagnosis and treatment to check your general health, the levels of red and white cells and platelets in your blood, and how well organs such as your liver and kidney are working\n- bone marrow sample – another biopsy may be carried out to see if the lymphoma has spread to your bone marrow; this involves using a long needle to remove a sample of bone marrow from your pelvis and can be done using a local anaesthetic\n- chest X-ray&nbsp;– this can check whether&nbsp;the cancer&nbsp;has spread to your chest or lungs\n- computerised tomography (CT) scan&nbsp;– this scan takes a series of X-rays that build up a 3D picture of the inside of the body to check the spread of&nbsp;the cancer&nbsp;\n- magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan – this scan uses strong magnetic fields to build up a detailed picture of areas of your body to check the spread of the cancer\n- positron emission tomography (PET) scan –&nbsp;this scan measures the activity of cells in different parts of the body and&nbsp;can check the spread of the cancer and the impact of treatment; it&#8217;s usually taken at the same time as a CT scan to show precisely how the tissues of different sites of the body are working\n- lumbar puncture&nbsp;– using a thin needle, a sample of spinal fluid is taken and examined to see if it contains any lymphoma cells\nWhen the testing is complete, it should be possible to determine the stage of your lymphoma. &#8216;Staging&#8217; means scoring the cancer by how far it&#8217;s spread.\nThe main stages of non-Hodgkin lymphoma are.\n- stage 1&nbsp;– the cancer is limited to 1 group of lymph nodes, such as your neck or groin nodes either above or below your diaphragm (the sheet of muscle underneath the lungs)\n- stage 2 – 2 or more lymph node groups are affected, either above or below&nbsp;the diaphragm\n- stage 3&nbsp;– the&nbsp;cancer has spread to lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm\n- stage 4&nbsp;– the lymphoma has spread through the lymphatic system and is now present in organs or bone marrow\nHealth professionals also add the letter &#8216;A&#8217; or &#8216;B&#8217; to your stage to indicate whether or not you have certain symptoms.\n&#8216;A&#8217;&nbsp;is put after your stage if you have no additional symptoms other than swollen lymph nodes. &#8216;B&#8217; is put after your stage if you have additional symptoms of weight loss, fever or night sweats.\nIn some cases, health professionals also use additional letters to indicate where the cancer first developed. For example, &#8216;E&#8217; (extranodal) means the cancer developed outside the lymphatic system.\nTesting can also help health professionals decide the &#8216;grade&#8217; of the cancer. There are two main grades of non-Hodgkin lymphoma:\n- low-grade or indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma is where the cancer develops slowly, and you may not experience any symptoms for many years\n- high-grade or aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma is where the cancer develops quickly and aggressively\nLow-grade tumours don&#8217;t necessarily require immediate medical treatment, but are harder to completely cure. High-grade lymphomas need to be treated immediately, but tend to respond much better to treatment and can often be cured.\nIn some cases, low-grade lymphomas can develop into high-grade lymphomas over time.\nRead more about treating non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma is usually treated with cancer-killing medication or radiotherapy, although some people may not need treatment straight away.\nIn a few cases,&nbsp;if the initial cancer is&nbsp;very small&nbsp;and can be removed during&nbsp;a&nbsp;biopsy, no further treatment may be needed.\nThe recommended treatment plan will depend on your general health and age,&nbsp;as many of the treatments can put a&nbsp;tremendous strain on the body.\nDiscussions about your treatment plan will usually take place with several doctors and other health professionals who specialise in different aspects of treating lymphoma. This is known as a multidisciplinary team (MDT).\nYour MDT will recommend the best treatment options for you. However, you shouldn&#8217;t be rushed into making a decision about your treatment plan. Before deciding, you may wish to talk to friends, family and your partner.\nYou&#8217;ll be invited back to see your care team for a full discussion about the risks and benefits of any treatments planned before treatment begins.\nYou can ask your&nbsp;care team&nbsp;if a clinical trial&nbsp;is available to take part in.\nIf the disease is low-grade (slow developing) and you&#8217;re well, a period of &#8216;watchful waiting&#8217; is often recommended. This is because some people take many years to develop troublesome symptoms and starting treatment immediately is often felt to be unnecessary.\nIf watchful waiting is recommended, you&#8217;ll be seen regularly for reviews and invited to come back at any stage if you feel your symptoms are getting worse.\nChemotherapy&nbsp;is a widely used treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which involves&nbsp;using medicine to kill cancer cells. It may be used on&nbsp;its own, combined with biological therapy and/or combined with radiotherapy (see below).\nThe medication can be given in a number of different ways, depending on the stage of your cancer.\nIf doctors think your cancer is curable, you&#8217;ll normally receive chemotherapy through a drip directly into a vein (intravenous chemotherapy).&nbsp;If a cure is unlikely, you may only need to take chemotherapy tablets to help relieve your symptoms.\nIf there&#8217;s a risk of the cancer spreading to your brain, you may have chemotherapy injections directly into the cerebrospinal fluid around your spine.\nChemotherapy is usually given over a period of a few months on an outpatient basis, which means you shouldn&#8217;t have to stay in hospital overnight. However, there may be times when your symptoms or the side effects of treatment become particularly troublesome, and a longer hospital stay may be needed.\nChemotherapy can have several side effects, the most significant of which is potential damage to your bone marrow. This can interfere with the production of healthy blood cells and cause the following problems:\n- fatigue\n- breathlessness\n- increased vulnerability to infection\n- bleeding and bruising more easily\nIf you experience these problems, treatment may need to be delayed so you can produce more healthy blood cells. Growth factor medicines can also stimulate the production of blood cells.\nOther possible side effects of chemotherapy include:\n- nausea and vomiting\n- diarrhoea\n- loss of appetite\n- mouth ulcers\n- tiredness\n- skin rashes\n- hair loss\n- infertility, which may be temporary or permanent\nMost side effects should pass once your treatment has finished. Tell your care team if side effects become particularly troublesome, as there are treatments that can help.\nRead more about the side effects of chemotherapy.\nIf non-Hodgkin lymphoma doesn&#8217;t get better with initial treatment (known as &#8216;refractory&#8217; lymphoma), you may have a course of chemotherapy at a stronger dose.\nHowever, this intensive chemotherapy destroys your bone marrow, leading to the problems mentioned above. You&#8217;ll need a stem cell or&nbsp;bone marrow transplants to replace the damaged bone marrow.\nRadiotherapy is&nbsp;most&nbsp;often&nbsp;used to treat early-stage non-Hodgkin lymphoma, where the cancer is only in 1 part of the body.\nTreatment is normally given in short daily sessions, Monday to Friday, over several weeks. You should not have to stay in hospital between appointments.\nRadiotherapy itself is painless, but it can have some significant side effects. These can vary, depending on which part of your body is being treated. For example, treatment to your throat can lead to a sore throat, while treatment to the head can lead to hair loss.\nOther common side effects include:\n- sore and red skin in the treatment area\n- tiredness\n- nausea and vomiting\n- dry mouth\n- loss of appetite\nMost side effects are temporary, but there&#8217;s a risk of long-term problems, including infertility and permanently darkened skin in the treatment area.\nRead more about:\n- side effects of radiotherapy\n- complications of non-Hodgkin lymphoma\nFor some types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, you may have a type of medication called a monoclonal antibody.\nThese medications attach themselves&nbsp;to the surface of cancerous cells and stimulate the immune system to attack and kill the cells. They&#8217;re often given in combination with chemotherapy to make the treatment more effective.\nFor some types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, you may continue having monoclonal antibody treatment regularly for up to 2 years after initial treatment, in combination with&nbsp;chemotherapy. This can reduce the chances of the cancer coming back in the future.\nOne of the main&nbsp;monoclonal antibody medications used to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma is called rituximab.&nbsp;This medication&nbsp;is administered directly into your vein over the course of a few hours.\nSide effects of rituximab can include:\n- flu-like symptoms, such as&nbsp;headaches, fever and chills\n- tiredness\n- nausea\n- an itchy rash\nYou may be given additional medication to prevent or lessen these side effects. Side effects should improve over time, as your body gets used to rituximab.\nAs&nbsp;rituximab has been so successful in treating non-Hodgkin lymphoma, scientists are working hard to make more monoclonal antibody treatments for lymphoma, and some of these are already at an advanced stage in clinical trials. You may be asked if you want to participate in one of these trials during your treatment.\nSteroid medication is commonly&nbsp;used in combination with chemotherapy to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This is because research has shown that using steroids makes the chemotherapy more effective.\nThe steroid medication is normally&nbsp;given as tablets, usually at the same time as your chemotherapy. A short course of steroids, lasting no more than a few months, is usually recommended, as this limits the number of side effects you could have.\nCommon side effects of short-term steroid use include:\n- increased appetite, which can lead to weight gain\n- indigestion\n- problems sleeping\n- feeling agitated\nOn rare occasions, you may have to take steroids on a long-term basis. Side effects of long-term steroid use include weight gain and swelling in your hands, feet and eyelids.\nThe side effects of steroid medication usually start to improve once treatment finishes.\nAfter your course of treatment ends, you may have a repeat scan to see how well the treatment has worked. Following this, you&#8217;ll need regular follow-up appointments to monitor your recovery and check for any signs of the cancer returning (known as a &#8216;relapse&#8217;).\nThese appointments will start off being every few weeks or months, but become less frequent over time.\nRead further&nbsp;information:\n- Cancer Research UK: Treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma\n- Cancer Research UK: Living with non-Hodgkin lymphoma\n- Macmillan Cancer Support: Treating non-Hodgkin lymphoma\n- Macmillan Cancer Support: Non-Hodgkin lymphoma\nSome people treated for non-Hodgkin lymphoma experience long-term problems, even if they&#8217;ve been cured.\nHaving a weakened immune system is a common complication of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and it can become more severe while you&#8217;re being treated.\nHowever, your immune system will usually recover in the months and years after treatment.\nIf you have a weak immune system, you&#8217;re more vulnerable to infections, and there&#8217;s an increased risk of developing serious complications from infections. In some cases, you may be advised to take regular doses of antibiotics to prevent infections occurring.\nIt&#8217;s also important to report any symptoms of an infection to your GP or care team immediately, because prompt treatment may be needed to prevent serious complications.&nbsp;This is particularly important in the first few months after treatment.\nSymptoms of infection include:\n- a high temperature (fever)\n- headache\n- aching muscles\n- diarrhoea\n- tiredness\n- a painful blistering rash\nYou should make sure that all of your vaccinations are up to date.\nHowever, it’s important to speak to your GP or care team about this because it may not be safe for you to have &#8216;live&#8217; vaccines (vaccines containing a weakened form of the virus or organism being vaccinated against) until several months after your treatment finishes.\nExamples of &#8216;live&#8217; vaccines include the:\n- shingles&nbsp;vaccine\n- BCG vaccine (against tuberculosis)\n- MMR vaccine (against measles, mumps and rubella)\nChemotherapy&nbsp;and&nbsp;radiotherapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma can cause infertility. This is sometimes temporary, but it can be permanent.\nYour care team will estimate the risk of infertility in your specific circumstances and let you know your options.\nIn some cases, it may be possible for men to store samples of their sperm and for women to store their eggs before treatment, so these can be used to try for a baby afterwards.\nHaving treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma can increase your risk of developing another type of cancer in the future. This is known as a &#8216;second cancer&#8217;.\nThe risk of getting cancer is particularly increased after cancer treatment because chemotherapy and radiotherapy damage healthy cells, as well as cancer cells. This damage can then cause the affected cells to become cancerous many years after treatment.\nYou can help to reduce your risk of a second cancer by adopting a healthy lifestyle by not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight with a balanced diet, and getting regular exercise.\nYou should report any symptoms that might suggest another cancer to your GP at an early stage and attend any cancer screening appointments you&#8217;re invited to.\nTreatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma can increase your risk of getting certain&nbsp;conditions&nbsp;at a younger age than normal, such as:\n- heart disease\n- lung disease\n- kidney disease\n- thyroid disease\n- diabetes&nbsp;\n- cataracts\nHaving a cancer diagnosis can also increase your risk of depression.\nYou should report unexpected symptoms, such as increased shortness of breath, to your GP."

        "description": "Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of blood cancer. It’s more common in boys than girls.\nMore children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.\nIt’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer. At times it can feel overwhelming and there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.\nUnderstanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. Your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information. If you have any questions it’s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.\nThe lymphatic system is part of the immune system, the body’s natural defence against infection and disease. This is a complex system made up of the bone marrow, thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes throughout the body. The lymph nodes are connected by a network of tiny lymphatic vessels.\nLymph nodes are also known as lymph glands, and the ones that you’re most likely to notice are those in the neck, armpit and groin.\nThe number of lymph nodes varies from one part of the body to another. In some parts there are very few, whereas under your arm there may be 20 to 50 nodes.\nCancers that start in the lymphatic system are called lymphomas. There are 2 main types of lymphoma:\n- Hodgkin lymphoma&nbsp;\n- non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)\nAlthough they’re both types of lymphoma, there are differences between them, which means they need different treatment.\nThere are 2 main types of NHL. B-cell NHL usually involves the lymph nodes in the abdomen and intestines, but may involve nodes in the head and neck. T-cell NHL usually affects lymph nodes in the chest.\nOccasionally, NHL can develop in unusual places outside the lymph nodes. This is called extranodal lymphoma.\nWe don’t know what causes NHL but there is research going on all the time to try to find out. It’s important to remember that nothing you have done has caused the cancer.\nThe first sign of NHL is usually a lump somewhere in the body, which is caused by swollen lymph nodes. This can cause different symptoms, depending on where the swollen lymph nodes are. If glands in the abdomen are affected, this may cause a feeling of being full after meals and some stomach pain. Other symptoms of NHL include a high temperature (fever), tiredness, weight loss, and loss of appetite. In a few children, lymphoma cells may be found in the bone marrow or in the fluid around the spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid).\nA variety of tests and investigations may be needed to diagnose NHL. Part, or all, of a swollen lymph gland, may be removed so that the cells can be examined in the laboratory (biopsy). This involves a small operation that is usually done under a general anaesthetic. Tests such as X-rays, ultrasound scans, MRI scans, CT scans, blood tests and bone marrow samples may be carried out to find out the extent of the disease. This is known as staging.\nAny tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group&nbsp;(CCLG) has more information about what the tests and scans involve.\nThe stage of a cancer is a term used to describe its size and whether it has spread beyond its original site. The type of treatment your child receives depends on the stage of the disease.&nbsp;\nOne group of lymph nodes is affected, or there’s a single extranodal tumour.\nTwo or more groups of nodes are affected, or there is a single extranodal tumour that has spread to nearby lymph nodes, or there are two single extranodal tumours, but only on one side of the diaphragm (the sheet of muscle under the lungs, which plays a large part in our breathing).\nThere’s lymphoma on both sides of the diaphragm (either in two or more groups of nodes) or there are two single extranodal tumours or the lymphoma is affecting the chest.\nThe lymphoma has spread beyond the lymph nodes to other organs of the body such as the bone marrow or nervous system.\nTreatment for NHL has a very good success rate and many people are cured.&nbsp;Chemotherapy&nbsp;is the most important treatment for children with NHL. Chemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells.\nIt’s common for a combination of drugs to be used and treatment may last a number of months or years. The treatment will be planned according to your child’s particular type of NHL and the stage of the disease. B-cell NHL is treated with 4&nbsp;to 8 courses of intensive chemotherapy. T-cell NHL is treated for about 2 years. Your child’s doctor will discuss the treatment options with you.\nNHL can sometimes affect the brain and spinal cord. To stop this, chemotherapy may be injected directly into the fluid around the spinal cord. This is called intrathecal chemotherapy.\nVery rarely,&nbsp;radiotherapy&nbsp;is also necessary. Radiotherapy treats cancer by using high-energy rays to destroy the cancer cells, while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells.\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with a bone marrow transplant is sometimes used (again very rarely) if the NHL comes back (recurs) after initial treatment.\nTreatment for NHL can cause different side effects, and your child’s doctor will discuss these with you before the treatment starts. Any possible side effects will depend on the part of the body that’s being treated and what treatment is being used. Some children have just a few side effects, while others experience more.\nSide effects can include:\n- feeling sick (nausea) and vomiting\n- a sore mouth\n- temporary&nbsp;hair loss\n- a low blood count leading to an increased risk of infection, bruising and bleeding (sometimes blood and/or platelet transfusions are needed)\n- tiredness\n- diarrhoea\nMonths or years later some children will develop late side effects from the treatment they have had. These include a possible reduction in bone growth, a change in the way the heart, lungs and kidneys work, and a small increase in the risk of developing another cancer in later life.\nAfter treatment with chemotherapy, some children – particularly boys – may become infertile. Older boys, and their parents, should be aware of the option of sperm banking. In this situation, sperm can be stored for possible use in later years.\nYour child’s doctor or nurse will talk to you about any possible late side effects and will keep a close eye on possible long-term side effects in follow-up clinics.\nMany children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Cancer research trials are carried out\nto try to find new and better treatments for cancer. Clinical trials mean there are now better results for curing children’s cancers compared with just a few years ago. Your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial and will answer any questions you have. Written information is provided to help explain things.\nTaking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide if it’s right for your child.\nSometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child’s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The&nbsp;Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group&nbsp;(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.\nOnce treatment has finished, the doctors will monitor your child closely with regular appointments in the hospital outpatient department.\nIf you have specific concerns about your child’s condition and treatment, it’s best to discuss them with your child’s doctor, who knows the situation in detail.\nAs a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time.\nYour child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer.\nFurther information and advice if your child has cancer"

        "disease": "Norovirus",
        "description": "Norovirus causes&nbsp;diarrhoea&nbsp;and&nbsp;vomiting&nbsp;and is one of the most common stomach bugs in the UK. It&#8217;s also called the &#8216;winter vomiting bug&#8217; because it&#8217;s more common in winter, but you can catch it at any time of the year.\nNorovirus can be very unpleasant but usually clears up by itself in a few days.\nYou can normally look after yourself or your child at home.\nAvoid going to your GP, as norovirus can spread to others very easily. Phone your GP practice or NHS 24 on&nbsp;111&nbsp;if you&#8217;re concerned or need advice.\nFind your nearest A&amp;E\nYou&#8217;re likely to have norovirus if you experience:\n- suddenly feeling sick\n- projectile vomiting\n- watery&nbsp;diarrhoea\nSome people also have a slight fever,&nbsp;headaches, painful stomach cramps and aching limbs.\nThe symptoms appear 1 to 2 days after you become infected and typically last for up to 2 or 3 days.\nNorovirus spreads very easily in public places such as hospitals, nursing homes and schools.\nYou can catch it if small particles of vomit or stools (poo) from an infected person get into your mouth through:\n- close contact with someone with norovirus who may breathe out small particles of the virus that you then inhale\n- touching contaminated surfaces or objects, as the virus can survive outside the body for several days\n- eating contaminated food, which can happen if an infected person doesn&#8217;t wash their hands before preparing or handling food\nNorovirus is most infectious from the start of symptoms until 48 hours after all symptoms have stopped. You may also be infectious for a short time before and after this.\nYou can get norovirus more than once because the virus is always changing and your body is unable to build up long-term resistance to it.\nIt&#8217;s not always possible to avoid getting norovirus, but following the advice can help stop the virus spreading. You should:\n- stay off work or school until at least 48 hours after the norovirus symptoms have stopped\n- avoid visiting anyone in hospital during this time\n- wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water particularly after using the toilet and before preparing or handling food\n- be aware alcohol-based hand gels don&#8217;t kill the virus\nMaintain basic hygiene and cleaning to help stop the spread of norovirus by:\n- disinfecting any surfaces or objects that could be contaminated, using a bleach-based household cleaner.\n- washing any items of clothing or bedding that could have become contaminated separately on a hot wash (60°C) to ensure the virus is killed.\n- not sharing towels and flannels\n- flushing any poo or vomit in the toilet and cleaning the surrounding area with a bleach-based household cleaner\n- avoiding eating raw, unwashed food\n- only eating oysters from a reliable source as they can carry norovirus\nIf you experience sudden diarrhoea and/or vomiting, the best thing to do is to stay at home until you&#8217;re feeling better.\nThere&#8217;s no treatment for norovirus, so you have to let it run its course.\nYou don&#8217;t usually need to get medical advice unless there&#8217;s a risk of a more serious problem.\nTo help ease your own or your child’s symptoms drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration.\nYou need to drink more than usual to replace the fluids lost from vomiting and diarrhoea – as well as water, adults could also try fruit juice and soup.\nAvoid giving fizzy drinks or fruit juice to children as it can make their diarrhoea worse. Babies should continue to feed as usual, either with breast milk or other milk feeds.\nYou can also:\n- take paracetamol for any fever or aches and pains\n- get plenty of rest\n- use special rehydration drinks, available from community pharmacies if you have signs of&nbsp;dehydration, such as a dry mouth or dark urine\nIf you feel like eating, try plain foods, such as soup, rice, pasta and bread.\nBabies and young children, especially under a year old, have a greater risk of becoming dehydrated.\nYou don&#8217;t normally need to see your GP if you think you or your child has norovirus, as there&#8217;s no specific treatment for it.\nAntibiotics&nbsp;won&#8217;t help because norovirus is caused by a virus."

        "disease": "Nosebleed",
        "description": "Nosebleeds are not usually a sign of anything serious. You can often treat them at home.\nDuring a nosebleed, blood flows from one or both nostrils. It can be heavy or light. It can last from a few seconds to 15 minutes or more.\nTo stop a nosebleed:\nIf the bleeding eventually stops, you won’t usually need to seek medical advice. But in some cases you may need further treatment from your GP or in hospital.\nIf your GP practice is closed, phone 111.\nThere are delicate blood vessels in your nose that can become damaged and bleed quite easily.\nCommon causes of nosebleeds include:\n- picking your nose\n- blowing your nose very hard\n- recently drinking alcohol\n- a minor injury to your nose\n- changes in humidity or temperature causing the inside of the nose to become dry and cracked\nOccasionally, bleeding can come from the blood vessels deeper within the nose. This can be caused by a blow to the head, recent nasal surgery or hardened arteries (atherosclerosis).\nNosebleeds are fairly common. Most people will get them every now and again. Anyone can get a nosebleed, but they most often affect:\n- children aged between 2 and 10\n- elderly people\n- pregnant women\n- people who take blood thinning medication such as aspirin or anticoagulants, such as warfarin\n- people with blood clotting disorders, such as haemophilia\nThere are things you can do to prevent nosebleeds.\nTalk to your GP if you often get nosebleeds and aren’t able to prevent them.\nIf you see your GP or go to hospital with a nosebleed, you’ll be assessed to find out how serious your condition is and what’s likely to have caused it. This may involve:\n- looking inside your nose\n- measuring your pulse and blood pressure\n- carrying out blood tests\n- asking about any other symptoms you have\nIf needed, your doctor will discuss additional treatments with you. For example, ointments for your nose, cautery to seal blood vessels in your nose or nasal packing may be required."

        "disease": "Obesity",
        "description": "The term &#8216;obese&#8217; describes a person who&#8217;s very overweight, with a lot of body fat.\nIt&#8217;s a common problem in the UK that&#8217;s estimated to affect&nbsp;around one in every four adults and around one in every five children aged 10 to 11.\nThere are many ways in which a person&#8217;s health in relation to their weight can be classified, but the most widely used method is body mass index (BMI).\nBMI is a measure of whether you&#8217;re a healthy weight for your height. You can use the BMI healthy weight chart to work out your score.\nFor most adults, a BMI of:\n- 18.5 to 24.9 means you&#8217;re a healthy weight\n- 25 to 29.9 means you&#8217;re overweight\n- 30 to 39.9 means you&#8217;re obese\n- 40 or above means you&#8217;re severely obese\nBMI isn&#8217;t used to definitively diagnose obesity, because people who are very muscular sometimes have a high BMI without excess fat.&nbsp;But for most people, BMI is a useful indication of whether they&#8217;re a healthy weight, overweight or obese.\nA better measure of excess fat is waist circumference, which can be used as an additional measure in people who are overweight (with a BMI of 25 to 29.9) or moderately obese (with a BMI of 30 to 34.9).\nGenerally, men with a waist circumference of 94cm (37in) or more and women with a waist circumference of 80cm (about 31.5in) or more are more likely to develop obesity-related health problems.\nRead more about diagnosing obesity\nIt&#8217;s very important to take steps to tackle obesity because, as well as causing&nbsp;obvious physical changes, it&nbsp;can lead to a number of serious and potentially life-threatening conditions, such as:\n- type 2 diabetes&nbsp;\n- coronary heart disease\n- some types of cancer, such as&nbsp;breast cancer and&nbsp;bowel cancer\n- stroke\nObesity can also affect your quality of life and lead to psychological problems, such as depression&nbsp;and&nbsp;low self-esteem (see below for more information about the health problems associated with obesity).\nObesity is generally caused by consuming more calories – particularly those in fatty and sugary foods – than you burn off through physical activity.&nbsp;The excess energy is stored by the body as fat.\nObesity is an increasingly common problem because for many people modern living involves eating excessive amounts of cheap, high-calorie food and spending a lot of time sitting down, at desks, on sofas or in cars.\nThere are also some underlying health conditions that can occasionally contribute to weight gain, such as an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism), although these type of conditions don’t usually cause weight problems if they&#8217;re effectively controlled with medication.\nRead more about the causes of obesity\nThe best way to treat obesity is to eat a healthy, reduced-calorie diet and exercise regularly. To do this you should:\n- eat a balanced, calorie-controlled diet as recommended by your GP or weight loss management health professional (such as a dietitian)\n- join a local weight loss group\n- take up activities such as fast walking, jogging, swimming or tennis for 150 to 300 minutes (two-and-a-half to five hours) a week\n- eat slowly and avoid situations where you know you could be tempted to overeat\nYou may also benefit from receiving psychological support from a trained healthcare professional to help change the way you think about food and eating.\nIf lifestyle changes alone don&#8217;t help you lose weight, a medication called orlistat may be recommended. If taken correctly, this medication works by reducing the amount of fat you absorb during digestion. Your GP will know whether orlistat is suitable for you.\nIn rare cases, weight loss surgery&nbsp;may be recommended.\nRead more about&nbsp;how obesity is treated\nObesity can&nbsp;cause a&nbsp;number of further problems, including difficulties with daily activities and serious health conditions.\nDay-to-day problems related to obesity include:\n- breathlessness\n- increased sweating\n- snoring\n- difficulty&nbsp;doing&nbsp;physical activity\n- often feeling very tired\n- joint and&nbsp;back pain\n- low confidence and self-esteem\n- feeling isolated\nThe psychological problems associated with being obese can also affect your relationships with family and friends, and may lead to depression.\nBeing obese can also increase your risk of developing many potentially serious&nbsp;health conditions, including:\n- type 2 diabetes&nbsp;–&nbsp;a condition that causes a person&#8217;s blood sugar level to become too high\n- high blood pressure\n- high cholesterol and atherosclerosis (where fatty deposits narrow your arteries), which can lead to coronary heart disease and stroke\n- asthma\n- metabolic syndrome –&nbsp;a combination of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity\n- several types of cancer, including bowel cancer, breast cancer&nbsp;and womb cancer\n- gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)&nbsp;–&nbsp;where stomach acid leaks out of the stomach and into the oesophagus (gullet)\n- gallstones&nbsp;–&nbsp;small stones, usually made of cholesterol, that form in the gallbladder\n- reduced fertility\n- osteoarthritis – a condition involving pain and stiffness in your joints\n- sleep apnoea&nbsp;–&nbsp;a condition that causes interrupted breathing during sleep, which can lead to daytime sleepiness with an increased risk of road traffic accidents, as well as a greater risk of diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease\n- liver disease and kidney disease\n- pregnancy complications,&nbsp;such as&nbsp;gestational diabetes or&nbsp;pre-eclampsia (when a woman experiences a potentially dangerous rise in blood pressure during pregnancy)\nObesity reduces life expectancy by an average of&nbsp;3 to&nbsp;10 years, depending on how severe it is. It&#8217;s estimated that obesity and being overweight contribute to at least&nbsp;1 in every 13 deaths in Europe.\nThere&#8217;s no &#8220;quick fix&#8221; for obesity. Weight loss programmes take time and commitment, and work best when fully completed. The healthcare professionals involved with your care should provide encouragement and advice about how to maintain the weight loss achieved.\nRegularly monitoring your weight, setting realistic goals and involving your friends and family with your attempts to lose weight&nbsp;can also help.\nRemember that even losing what seems like a small amount of weight, such as 3% or more of your original body weight, and maintaining this for life, can significantly reduce your risk of developing obesity-related complications like diabetes and heart disease.\nObesity is generally caused by eating too much and moving too little.\nIf you consume high amounts of energy, particularly fat and sugars, but don&#8217;t burn off the energy through exercise and physical activity, much of the surplus energy will be stored by the body as fat.\nThe energy value of food is measured in units called calories. The average physically active man needs about 2,500 calories a day to maintain a healthy weight, and the average physically active woman needs about 2,000 calories a day.\nThis amount of calories may sound high, but it can be easy to reach if you eat certain types of food. For example, eating a large takeaway hamburger, fries and a milkshake can total 1,500 calories – and that&#8217;s just one meal.&nbsp;\nAnother problem is that many people aren&#8217;t physically active, so lots of the calories they consume end up being stored in their body as fat.\nObesity doesn&#8217;t happen overnight. It develops gradually over time, as a result of poor diet and lifestyle choices, such as:\n- eating large amounts of processed or fast food – that&#8217;s high in fat and sugar\n- drinking too much&nbsp;alcohol –&nbsp;alcohol contains a lot of calories, and people who drink heavily are often overweight\n- eating out a lot –&nbsp;you may be tempted to also have a starter or dessert in a restaurant, and the food can be higher in fat and sugar\n- eating larger portions than you need –&nbsp;you may be encouraged to eat too much if your friends or relatives are also eating large portions\n- drinking too many sugary drinks – including soft drinks and fruit juice\n- comfort eating –&nbsp;if you have low self-esteem or feel depressed, you may eat to make yourself feel better\nUnhealthy eating habits tend to run in families. You may learn bad eating habits from your parents when you&#8217;re young and continue them into adulthood.\nRead more about eating well\nLack of physical activity is another important factor related to obesity. Many people have jobs that involve sitting at a desk for most of the day. They also rely on their cars, rather than walking or cycling.\nFor&nbsp;relaxation, many people tend to watch TV, browse the internet or play computer games, and rarely take regular exercise.\nIf you&#8217;re not active enough, you don&#8217;t use the energy provided by the food you eat, and the extra energy you consume is stored by the body as fat.\nThe Department of Health recommends that adults do at least 150 minutes (two-and-a-half hours) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, such as cycling or fast walking, every week. This doesn’t need to be done all&nbsp;in one go, but can be broken down into smaller periods. For example, you could exercise for 30 minutes a day for five days a week.\nIf you&#8217;re obese and trying to lose weight, you may need to do more exercise than this. It may help to start off slowly and gradually increase the amount of exercise you do each week.\nRead more about the physical activity guidelines for adults\nSome people claim&nbsp;there&#8217;s no point trying to lose weight because &#8220;it runs in my family&#8221; or &#8220;it&#8217;s in my genes&#8221;.\nWhile there are some rare genetic conditions that can cause obesity, such as&nbsp;Prader-Willi syndrome, there&#8217;s no reason why most people can&#8217;t lose weight.\nIt may be true that certain genetic traits inherited from your parents&nbsp;–&nbsp;such as having a large appetite&nbsp;–&nbsp;may make losing weight more difficult, but it certainly doesn&#8217;t make it impossible.\nIn many cases, obesity is more to do with environmental factors, such as poor eating habits learned during childhood.\nIn some cases, underlying medical conditions may contribute to weight gain. These include:\n- an&nbsp;underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)&nbsp;–&nbsp;where your thyroid gland doesn&#8217;t produce enough hormones\n- Cushing&#8217;s syndrome&nbsp;–&nbsp;a rare disorder that causes the over-production of steroid hormones\nHowever, if conditions such as these are properly diagnosed and treated, they should pose less of a barrier to weight loss.\nCertain medicines, including some corticosteroids, medications for epilepsy and diabetes, and some medications used to treat mental illness – including antidepressants and medicines for schizophrenia – can contribute to weight gain.\nWeight gain can sometimes be a side effect of stopping smoking.\nBody mass index (BMI) is widely used as a simple and reliable way of finding out whether a person is a healthy weight for their height.\nFor most adults, having a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 means you&#8217;re considered to be a healthy weight. A person with a BMI of 25 to 29.9 is considered to be overweight, and someone with a BMI over 30 is considered to be obese.\nWhile BMI is a useful measurement for most people, it&#8217;s not accurate for everyone.\nFor example, the normal BMI scores may not be accurate if you&#8217;re very muscular because muscle can add extra pounds, resulting in&nbsp;a high BMI when you&#8217;re not an unhealthy weight. In such cases, your waist circumference may be a better guide (see below).\nWhat&#8217;s considered a healthy BMI is also influenced by your ethnic background. The scores mentioned above generally apply to people with a white Caucasian background. If you have an ethnic minority background, the threshold for being considered overweight or obese may be lower.\nBMI shouldn&#8217;t be used to work out whether a child is a healthy weight, because&nbsp;their bodies are still developing.&nbsp;Speak to your GP if you want to find out whether your child is overweight.\nIf you&#8217;re overweight or obese, visit your GP for advice about losing weight safely and to find out whether you have an increased risk of health problems.\nYour GP&nbsp;may ask about:\n- your lifestyle – particularly your diet and how much physical activity you do; they&#8217;ll also ask you whether you smoke and how much&nbsp;alcohol you drink\n- any possible underlying causes for your obesity – for example, if you&#8217;re taking medication or have a medical condition that may contribute to&nbsp;weight gain\n- how you feel about being overweight – for example, if it makes you feel depressed\n- how motivated you are to lose weight\n- your family history – as obesity and other health conditions, such as diabetes, are often more common in families\nAs well as calculating your BMI, your GP may also carry out tests to determine whether you&#8217;re at increased risk of developing health complications because of your weight.\nThese could include&nbsp;measuring your:\n- blood pressure\n- glucose (sugar) and cholesterol levels in a blood sample\n- waist circumference (the distance around your waist)\nPeople with very large waists – generally, 94cm (37in) or more in men and 80cm (about 31.5in) or more in women – are more likely to develop obesity-related health problems.\nYour GP may also take your ethnicity into account because it can affect your risk of developing certain conditions. For example, some people of Asian, African or Afro-Caribbean ethnicity may be at increased risk of high blood pressure (hypertension). Healthy waist measurements can also be different for people from different ethnic backgrounds.\nAfter your assessment, you&#8217;ll be offered an appointment to discuss the results in more detail, ask any questions that you have, and fully explore the treatment options available to you.\nIf you&#8217;re obese, speak to your GP for advice about losing weight safely.\nYour GP can advise you about losing weight safely by eating a&nbsp;healthy, balanced diet and regular physical activity.\nThey can also let you know about&nbsp;other useful services, such as:\n- local weight loss groups – these could be provided by your local authority, the NHS, or commercial services you may have to pay for\n- exercise on prescription – where you&#8217;re referred to a local active health team for a number of sessions under the supervision of a qualified trainer\nIf you have underlying problems associated with obesity, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), high blood pressure, diabetes or obstructive sleep apnoea, your GP may recommend further tests or specific treatment. In some cases, they may refer you to a specialist.\nRead more about how your GP can help you lose weight\nThere&#8217;s no single rule that applies to everyone, but to lose weight at a safe and sustainable rate of 0.5 to 1kg (1lb to 2lbs) a week, most people are advised to reduce their energy intake by 600 calories a day.\nFor most men, this will mean consuming no more than 1,900 calories a day, and for most women, no more than 1,400 calories a day.\nThe best way to achieve this&nbsp;is to swap unhealthy and high-energy food choices – such as fast food, processed food and sugary drinks (including alcohol) – for healthier choices.\nA healthy diet should consist of:\n- plenty of fruit and vegetables\n- plenty of potatoes, bread, rice, pasta and other starchy foods (ideally you should choose wholegrain varieties)\n- some&nbsp;milk and dairy foods\n- some meat, fish, aggs,&nbsp;beans&nbsp;and other non-dairy sources of protein\n- just small amounts of food and drinks that are high in&nbsp;fat&nbsp;and&nbsp;suagr\nTry to avoid&nbsp;foods containing high levels of salt because they can raise your blood pressure, which can be dangerous&nbsp;for people who are already obese.\nYou&#8217;ll also need to check&nbsp;calorie information for each type of food and drink you consume to make sure you don&#8217;t go over your daily limit.\nSome restaurants,&nbsp;cafés and fast food outlets provide calorie information per portion, although providing this information isn&#8217;t compulsory. Be careful&nbsp;when eating out because some foods can quickly take you over the limit, such as burgers, fried chicken, and some curries or Chinese dishes.\nAvoid&nbsp;fad diets that recommend unsafe practices, such as fasting (going without food for long periods of time) or cutting out entire food groups. These types of diets&nbsp;don&#8217;t work, can make you feel ill, and aren&#8217;t sustainable because they don’t teach you long-term healthy eating habits.\nThis isn&#8217;t to say that all commercial diet programmes are unsafe. Many are based on sound medical and scientific principles and can work well for some people.\nA responsible diet programme should:\n- educate you about issues such as portion size, making behavioural changes&nbsp;and healthy eating&nbsp;\n- not be overly restrictive in terms of the type of foods you can eat&nbsp;\n- be based on achieving gradual, sustainable weight loss rather than short-term rapid weight loss, which is unlikely to last\nA&nbsp;very low calorie diet (VLCD) is where you consume less than 800 calories a day.\nThese diets can lead to rapid weight loss, but&nbsp;they aren&#8217;t a suitable or safe method for everyone, and they aren&#8217;t routinely recommended for managing obesity.\nVLCDs are usually only recommended if you have an obesity-related complication that would benefit from rapid weight loss.\nVLCDs&nbsp;shouldn&#8217;t usually be followed for longer than 12 weeks at a time, and they should only be used under the supervision of a suitably qualified healthcare professional.\nSpeak to your GP first if&nbsp;you&#8217;re considering this type of diet.\nReducing the amount of calories in your diet will help you lose weight, but maintaining a healthy weight requires physical activity to burn energy.\nAs well as helping you maintain a healthy weight, physical activity also has wider health benefits. For example, it can help prevent and manage more than&nbsp;20 conditions, such as reducing the risk of&nbsp;type 2 diabetes by 40%.\nThe Chief Medical Officers recommend that adults should do at least 150 minutes (two-and-a-half hours) of at least moderate-intensity activity a week – for example, five 30-minute bouts a week. Something is better than nothing, and doing just 10 minutes of exercise at a time is beneficial.\nModerate-intensity activity is any activity that increases your heart and breathing rate, such as:\n- brisk walking\n- cycling\n- recreational swimming\n- dancing\nAlternatively, you could do 75 minutes (one hour, fifteen minutes) of vigorous-intensity activity&nbsp;a week, or a combination of moderate and vigorous activity.\nDuring vigorous activity, breathing is very hard, your heart beats rapidly and you may be unable to hold a conversation. Examples include:\n- running\n- most competitive sports\n- circuit training\nYou should also do strength and balance training two days a week. This could be in the form of a gym workout, carrying shopping bags, or doing an activity such as tai chi. It&#8217;s also critical that you break up sitting (sedentary) time by getting up and moving around.\nRead more about&nbsp;strength&nbsp;and&nbsp;balance exercises.\nYour GP, weight loss adviser or staff at&nbsp;your local sports centre can help you create a plan suited to your own personal needs and circumstances, with achievable and motivating goals. Start small and build up gradually.\nIt&#8217;s also&nbsp;important to find activities you enjoy and want to keep doing. Activities with a social element or exercising with friends or family can help keep you motivated. Make a start today – it’s never too late.\nRead more about the physical activity guidelines for adults.\nEvidence has shown that weight loss can be more successful if it involves other strategies, alongside diet and lifestyle changes. This could include things like:\n- setting realistic weight loss goals – if you&#8217;re obese, losing just 3% of your original body weight can significantly reduce your risk of developing obesity-related complications\n- eating more slowly and being mindful of what and when you&#8217;re eating – for example, not being distracted by watching TV\n- avoiding situations where you know you may be tempted to overeat\n- involving your family and friends with your weight loss efforts –they can help to motivate you\n- monitoring your progress – for example, weigh yourself regularly and make a note of your weight in a diary\nGetting psychological support from a trained healthcare professional may also&nbsp;help you change the way you think about food and eating. Techniques such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)&nbsp;can be useful.\nIt&#8217;s important to remember that as you lose weight your body needs less food (calories), so after a few months, weight loss slows and levels off, even if you continue to follow a diet.\nIf you go back to your previous calorie intake once you&#8217;ve lost weight, it&#8217;s very likely you&#8217;ll put the weight back on. Increasing physical activity to up to 60 minutes a day and continuing to watch what you eat may help you keep the weight off.\nMany&nbsp;different types of anti-obesity medicines have been tested in clinical trials, but only one has proved to be safe and effective: orlistat.\nYou can only use orlistat if a doctor or pharmacist thinks it&#8217;s the right medicine for you. In most cases, orlistat is only available on prescription. Only one product (Alli) is available over the counter directly from pharmacies, under the supervision of a pharmacist.\nOrlistat works by preventing&nbsp;around a third of the fat from the food you eat being absorbed. The undigested fat isn&#8217;t absorbed into your body and is passed out with your faeces (stools). This will help you avoid gaining weight, but won&#8217;t necessarily cause you to lose weight.\nA balanced diet and exercise programme should be started before beginning treatment with orlistat, and you should continue this programme during treatment and after you stop&nbsp;taking orlistat.\nOrlistat will usually only be recommended if you&#8217;ve made a significant effort to lose weight through diet, exercise or changing your lifestyle.\nEven then, orlistat is only prescribed if you have a:\n- body mass index (BMI) of 28 or more, and other weight-related conditions,&nbsp;such as high blood pressure or type 2 diabetes\n- BMI of 30 or more\nBefore prescribing orlistat, your doctor will discuss the benefits and potential limitations with you, including any potential side effects (see below).&nbsp;\nTreatment with orlistat must be combined with a balanced low-fat diet and other weight loss strategies, such as doing more exercise.&nbsp;It&#8217;s important that the diet is nutritionally balanced over three main meals.\nIf you&#8217;re prescribed orlistat, you&#8217;ll also be offered advice and support about diet, exercise and making lifestyle changes.\nOrlistat isn&#8217;t usually recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women.\nOne orlistat capsule is taken with water immediately before, during or up to one hour after, each main meal (up to a maximum of three capsules a day).\nIf you miss a meal, or the meal doesn&#8217;t contain any fat, you shouldn&#8217;t need to take the orlistat capsule. Your doctor should explain this to you, or you can check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine.\nTreatment with orlistat should only continue beyond three months if you&#8217;ve lost 5% of your body weight. It usually starts to affect how you digest fat within&nbsp;one to two&nbsp;days.\nIf you haven&#8217;t lost weight after taking orlistat for&nbsp;three months, it&#8217;s unlikely to be an effective treatment for you. Consult your doctor or pharmacist, as it may be necessary to stop your treatment.\nSee your GP before starting treatment with orlistat if you have another serious health condition, such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney disease, which you&#8217;re taking medication for. It may be necessary to change the dose of your medicine.\nIf you have&nbsp;type 2 diabetes, it may take you longer to lose weight using orlistat, so your target weight loss after three months may therefore be slightly lower.\nIf orlistat has helped you lose weight after three months, your prescription may be continued for up to a year. After that, your GP will carry out a review and decide whether you should continue taking it.\nCommon side effects of orlistat include:\n- fatty or oily stools\n- needing the toilet urgently\n- passing stools more frequently\n- an oily discharge from your rectum (you may have oily spots on your underwear)\n- flatulence (wind)\n- stomach pain\n- headaches\n- upper respiratory tract infections, such as a cold\nThese side effects are much less likely to occur if you stick to a low-fat diet.\nWomen taking&nbsp;the&nbsp;oral contraceptive pill&nbsp;should use an additional method of contraception, such as a&nbsp;condom, if they experience severe diarrhoea while taking orlistat. This is because the contraceptive pill may not be absorbed by your body if you have diarrhoea, so it may not be effective.\nWeight loss surgery, also called bariatric surgery, is sometimes used to treat people who are severely obese.\nBariatric surgery is usually only available on the NHS to treat people with severe obesity who fulfil all of the following criteria:\n- they have a BMI of 40 or more, or between 35 and 40 and another serious health condition that could be improved with weight loss, such as type 2 diabetes&nbsp;or&nbsp;high blood pressure\n- all appropriate non-surgical measures have been tried, but the person hasn&#8217;t achieved or maintained adequate, clinically beneficial weight loss\n- the person is fit enough to have anaesthesia and surgery\n- the person has been receiving, or will receive, intensive management as part of their treatment\n- the person commits to the need for long-term follow-up\nBariatric surgery may also be considered as a possible treatment option for people with a BMI of 30 to 35 who have recently (in the last 10 years) been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.\nIn rare cases, surgery may be recommended as the first treatment (instead of lifestyle treatments and medication) if a person&#8217;s BMI is 50 or above.\nTreating obesity in children usually involves improvements to diet and increasing physical activity using behaviour change strategies.\nThe amount of calories your child should eat each day will depend on their age and height. Your GP should be able to advise you about a recommended daily limit, and they may also be able to refer you to your local family healthy lifestyle programme.\nChildren over the age of five should ideally get at least one hour (60 minutes) of vigorous-intensity exercise a day, such as running or playing football or netball. Sedentary activities, such as watching television and playing computer games, should be restricted.\nRead more about the physical activity guidelines for children and young people\nReferral to a specialist in treating childhood obesity may be recommended if your child develops an obesity-related complication, or there&#8217;s thought to be an underlying medical condition causing obesity.\nThe use of orlistat in children is only recommended in exceptional circumstances, such as if a child is severely obese and has an obesity-related complication.\nBariatric surgery isn&#8217;t generally recommended for children, but may be considered for young people in exceptional circumstances, and if they&#8217;ve achieved, or nearly achieved, physiological maturity."

        "disease": "Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)",
        "description": "Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition. It causes a person to have obsessive thoughts and carry out compulsive activity.\nThis can be distressing and can have a big impact on your life. Treatment can help you keep it under control.\nOCD affects people differently. It usually causes a particular pattern of thought and behaviour.\nThis pattern has 4 main steps:\nAlmost everyone has unpleasant or unwanted thoughts at some point in their life. This might be a concern that you&#8217;ve forgotten to lock the door of the house or that you might get a disease from touching other people. It could be sudden unwelcome violent or offensive mental images.\nMost people are able to put these types of thoughts and concerns into context. They can then carry on with their day-to-day life. They do not repeatedly think about worries they know have little substance.\nIf you have persistent and unwanted thoughts that dominates your thinking, you may have developed an obsession.\nSome common obsessions that affect people with OCD include:\n- fear of deliberately harming yourself or others – for example, fear you may attack someone else, even though this type of behaviour disgusts you\n- fear of harming yourself or others by mistake or accident – for example, fear you may set the house on fire by accidentally leaving the cooker on\n- fear of contamination by disease, infection or an unpleasant substance\n- a need for symmetry or orderliness – for example, you may feel the need to ensure all the tins in your cupboard face the same way\nCompulsions happen as a way of trying to reduce or prevent the harm of the obsessive thought. However, this behaviour is either excessive or not connected at all.\nFor example, a person who fears becoming contaminated with dirt and germs may wash their hands repeatedly. Or someone with a fear of causing harm to their family may have the urge to repeat an action multiple times to try to &#8216;neutralise&#8217; the thought of harm. This type of compulsive behaviour is particularly common in children with OCD.\nMost people with OCD realise that such compulsive behaviour is irrational. They might know it makes no logical sense, but they cannot stop acting on their compulsion.\nNot all compulsive behaviours will be obvious to other people.\nSome people with OCD may also have or develop other mental health problems, including:\n- depression\n- eating disorders\n- generalised anxiety disorder\n- a hoarding disorder\nPeople with OCD and severe depression might also have suicidal feelings.\nThe exact cause of OCD is not known. There are some factors that could make a person more likely to have OCD.\nThese factors might include:\n- genetics\n- life events\n- personality traits\n- chemical differences in the brain\nDiagnosis and treatment can help to reduce the impact of OCD on your day-to-day life.\nMany people do not tell their GP about their symptoms because they feel ashamed or embarrassed. They may also try to disguise their symptoms from family and friends.\nIf you have OCD, you should not feel ashamed or embarrassed. Like diabetes or asthma, it&#8217;s a long-term health condition, and it&#8217;s not your fault you have it.\nYour GP will probably ask you a series of questions to see if it&#8217;s likely you have OCD.\nIf the results of the initial screening questions suggest you have OCD, the severity of your symptoms will be assessed. Either your GP or a mental health professional will carry out the assessment.\nIt&#8217;s important you&#8217;re open and honest. Accurate and truthful responses will ensure you receive the most appropriate treatment.\nIf you think someone you know may have OCD, it&#8217;s a good idea to:\n- talk to them carefully about your concerns\n- suggest they speak to their GP\nTreatment for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) depends on the how much the condition is affecting your daily life.\nThe 2 main treatments are:\n- cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)\n- medication\nIf your OCD has a severe impact on your daily life, you&#8217;ll usually be referred to a specialist mental health service. Here you&#8217;ll likely receive a combination of intensive CBT and a course of antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).\nChildren with OCD are usually referred to a healthcare professional with experience of treating OCD in children.\nIt can take several months before a treatment has a noticeable effect.\nYou might be offered specialist treatment if you&#8217;ve tried other treatments and your OCD is still not under control.\nMost people improve after receiving treatment.\nOCD Action have online support groups where you can connect with other people with similar experiences."

        "disease": "Obstructive sleep apnoea",
        "description": "Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a relatively common condition where the walls of the throat relax and narrow or close during sleep. This interrupts normal breathing. It may lead to regularly broken sleep which can:\n- impact your quality of life – mainly by making you very sleepy during the day\n- increase the risk of developing certain conditions\nOSA can be 2 types of breathing interruption:\n- apnoea – a total blockage of the airway for 10 seconds or more\n- hypopnoea – a partial blockage of the airway that causes airflow to reduce by more than 50% for 10 seconds or more\nPeople with OSA may have apnoea and hypopnoea throughout the night. Episodes may occur around once every 1 or 2 minutes in severe cases.\nOSA is sometimes called obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS). This is where people have apnoeas and hypopnoeas throughout the night, as well as impacted quality of life due to sleepiness during the day and other symptoms. OSA and OSAHS are the same thing.\nSigns of OSA can include:\n- being very sleepy during the day\n- breathing pauses through the night – this may be noticed by a partner, friend or relative\n- loud snoring\n- noisy and/or laboured breathing\n- repeated periods where breathing stops or is interrupted by gasping or snorting\nSome people with OSA may also experience night sweats and may wake up often during the night to pee.\nDuring an episode, the lack of oxygen triggers your brain to pull you out of deep sleep either to a lighter sleep or to wakefulness. Your airway then reopens and you can breathe normally. These repeated sleep interruptions can make you feel very tired and more likely to fall asleep during the day. You&#8217;ll usually have no memory of your interrupted breathing, so you may be unaware you have a problem.\nThey can check for other possible reasons for your symptoms and may refer you to a sleep specialist.\nBefore seeing your GP it may be helpful to ask a partner, friend or relative to watch you while you&#8217;re asleep, if possible. If you have OSA, they may be able to spot breathing pauses.\nIt may also help to fill out an Epworth Sleepiness Scale questionnaire. This asks how likely it is for you to doze off in different situations. For example, watching TV, sitting in a meeting or while driving. The final score will help your doctor determine whether you may have a sleep disorder.\nYour GP will usually ask questions about your symptoms. They may also take your blood pressure and a blood sample. This can help to rule out other conditions that may explain your tiredness. For example, an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) or anaemia.\nThe next step will usually be an assessment through the night (sleep study). Your sleeping pattern will be checked to find whether or not you have a high number of breathing pauses through the night. It&#8217;s common to have breathing pauses through the night but a high number is abnormal. Your GP can refer you to specialist clinics or hospital departments that help investigate and treat people with sleep disorders.\nThe sleep specialists at the sleep centre may ask you about your symptoms and medical history, and carry out a physical examination.\nThis may include measuring your height and weight to work out your body mass index (BMI), as well as measuring your neck circumference. This is because being overweight and having a large neck can increase your risk of OSA.\nThe sleep specialists will then arrange for your sleep to be assessed overnight. This can be done either by:\n- taking some monitoring equipment home with you and bringing it back the next day for them to analyse – this is common\n- spending the night at the clinic – this is rare\nIn many cases the sleep centre will teach you how to use portable recording equipment while you sleep at home.\nThe equipment you are given may include:\n- a breathing sensor at your nose or mouth\n- sensors to monitor your heart rate\n- bands that are placed around your chest\n- oxygen sensors that are put on your finger\n- a small sensor that sticks on your chin\nThe equipment records oxygen levels, breathing movements, heart rate, snoring, and body sleeping position through the night.\nIf more information is needed, you may be asked to spend the night at the sleep centre.\nThe main test carried out to analyse your sleep at a sleep centre is known as polysomnography.\nDuring the night, several different parts of your body will be carefully monitored while you sleep.\nBands and small metallic discs called electrodes are placed on the surface of your skin and different parts of your body. Sensors are also placed on your legs and an oxygen sensor will be attached to your finger.\nDifferent tests will be carried out during polysomnography, including:\n- electroencephalography (EEG) – this monitors brain waves\n- electromyography (EMG) – this monitors muscle tone\n- recordings of movements in your chest and abdomen\n- recordings of airflow through your mouth and nose\n- pulse oximetry – this measures your heart rate and blood oxygen levels\n- electrocardiography (ECG) – this monitors your heart\nSound recording and video equipment may also be used.\nIf OSA is diagnosed during the early part of the night, you may be given continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment. CPAP involves using a mask that delivers constant compressed air to the airway and stops it closing, which prevents OSA.\nOnce the tests have been completed, staff at the sleep centre should have a good idea about whether or not you have OSA. If you do, they can determine how much it is interrupting your sleep and recommend the right treatment.\nThe severity of OSA is determined by how many breathing pauses you have per hour of sleep. These episodes are measured using the apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI).\nSeverity is measured using the following criteria:\n- mild – an AHI reading of 5 to 14 episodes an hour\n- moderate – an AHI reading of 15 to 30 episodes an hour\n- severe – an AHI reading of more than 30 episodes an hour\nTreatment is most likely to be beneficial in people with moderate or severe OSA. Treatment is also most likely to help people who are very sleepy during the day. However, treatment may also help some people with mild OSA.\nThere are treatments that can reduce the symptoms of OSA.\nLifestyle changes include:\n- losing weight\n- stopping smoking\n- cutting down on alcohol\n- sleeping on your side\n- avoiding sedative medications and sleeping tablets\nPeople with moderate to severe OSA usually need to use a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device. It delivers a continuous supply of compressed air through a mask. This prevents your airway closing while you sleep.\nCPAP can feel peculiar to start with and you may be tempted to stop using it. But people who persevere usually soon get used to it and their symptoms improve significantly.\nCPAP is available on the NHS and is the most effective therapy for treating severe cases of OSA. Telemonitoring may be used to check how well CPAP is working for you. Telemonitoring means healthcare professionals can check your use of CPAP therapy. They can see if there are any issues that they can help with and make adjustments where needed.\nAs well as reducing symptoms such as snoring and tiredness, it can also reduce the risk of complications of OSA in people who have symptoms, such as high blood pressure.\nPossible side effects of using a CPAP device can include:\n- mask discomfort\n- nasal congestion, runny nose or irritation\n- difficulty breathing through your nose\n- headaches and ear pain\n- stomach pain and flatulence (wind)\n- claustrophobia\nA mandibular advancement device (MAD) is a dental appliance, like a gum shield, sometimes used to treat mild OSA.\nThey&#8217;re not generally recommended for more severe OSA. But they may be an option if a CPAP device isn&#8217;t right for you.\nA MAD is worn over your teeth when you&#8217;re asleep. It holds your jaw and tongue forward to increase the space at the back of your throat and reduce the narrowing of your airway that causes snoring.\nIt&#8217;s recommended you have a MAD made for you by a dentist with training and experience in treating sleep apnoea. MADs aren&#8217;t always available on the NHS, so you may need to pay for the device privately through a dentist or orthodontist.\nA MAD may not be a suitable treatment for you if you don&#8217;t have many – or any – teeth. If you have dental caps, crowns or bridgework, speak to your dentist to make sure they won&#8217;t be stressed or damaged by a MAD.\nSurgery may also be an option if OSA is thought to be the result of a physical problem that can be corrected surgically. For example, an enlarged tonsillar tissue. For most people surgery isn&#8217;t appropriate. It may only be considered as a last resort if other treatments haven&#8217;t helped.\nOSA can have a significant impact on the quality of life for someone with the condition, as well as their friends and families.\nIt can cause physical problems tiredness and headaches. It can also have a significant emotional impact and affect your relationships with others.\nAsthma + Lung UK and Sleep Apnoea Trust provide support and advice about living with OSA.\nTreatments can often help control the symptoms of OSA, but they&#8217;ll need to be lifelong in most cases.\nIf OSA is left untreated, it can cause problems such as poor performance at work and school, and placing a strain on your relationships.\nPoorly controlled OSA may also increase your risk of:\n- developing high blood pressure (hypertension)\n- having a stroke or heart attack\n- developing an irregular heartbeat – such as atrial fibrillation\n- developing type 2 diabetes – although it&#8217;s unclear if this is the result of an underlying cause, such as obesity\nSomeone who has been deprived of sleep because of OSA may be more likely to be involved in a car accident. If you&#8217;re diagnosed with OSA, it may mean your ability to drive is affected. You must inform the DVLA about a medical condition that could impact your driving ability.\nOnce a diagnosis of OSA has been made, you shouldn&#8217;t drive until your symptoms are well controlled.\nGOV.UK has advice about how to tell the DVLA about a medical condition."

        "disease": "Oesophageal cancer",
        "description": "Oesophageal cancer is a type of cancer affecting the oesophagus (gullet) – the long tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach.\nIt mainly affects people in their 60s and 70s and is more common in men than women.\nOesophageal cancer doesn&#8217;t usually cause any symptoms in the early stages when the tumour is small. It&#8217;s only when it gets bigger that symptoms tend to develop.\nSymptoms of oesophageal cancer can include:\n- difficulty swallowing\n- persistent&nbsp;indigestion or&nbsp;heartburn\n- bringing up food soon after eating\n- loss of appetite and&nbsp;weight loss\n- pain or discomfort in&nbsp;your upper tummy, chest or back\nRead more about the symptoms of oesophageal cancer\nSpeak to your GP if you experience:\n- swallowing difficulties\n- heartburn on most days for three weeks or more\n- any other unusual or persistent symptoms\nThe symptoms can be caused by&nbsp;several conditions and in many cases won&#8217;t be caused by cancer&nbsp;– but it&#8217;s a good idea to get them checked out.\nIf your GP thinks you need to have some tests, they can refer you to a hospital specialist.\nRead about&nbsp;how oesophageal cancer is diagnosed\nThe exact cause of oesophageal cancer is unknown, but the following things can increase your risk:\n- persistent&nbsp;gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)\n- smoking\n- drinking too much alcohol over a long period of time\n- being overweight or obese\n- having an unhealthy diet that&#8217;s low in fruit and vegetables\nStopping smoking, cutting down on alcohol, losing weight and having a healthy diet may help reduce your risk of developing oesophageal cancer.\nRead more about the&nbsp;causes of oesophageal cancer\nIf oesophageal cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, it may be possible to cure it with:\n- surgery to remove the affected section of oesophagus\n- chemotherapy, with or without&nbsp;radiotherapy (chemoradiation), to kill the cancerous cells and shrink the tumour\nIf oesophageal cancer is diagnosed at a later stage, a&nbsp;cure may not be achievable.\nBut in these cases, surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy can be used to help keep the cancer under control and relieve any symptoms you have.\nRead more about how oesophageal cancer is treated&nbsp;and living with oesophageal cancer\nOesophageal cancer doesn&#8217;t usually have any symptoms at first. But as the cancer grows, it can cause swallowing problems and other symptoms.\nDifficulty swallowing is the most common symptom of oesophageal cancer.\nThe cancer can narrow the oesophagus, making it difficult for food to pass down. It may feel as though food is getting stuck and sometimes swallowing may be uncomfortable or painful.\nYou may have to chew your food more thoroughly, or you can only eat soft foods. If the tumour continues to grow, even liquids may become difficult to swallow.\nOther symptoms of oesophageal cancer can include:\n- persistent&nbsp;indigestion or&nbsp;heartburn\n- bringing up food soon after eating\n- loss of appetite and weight loss\n- persistent&nbsp;vomiting\n- pain or discomfort in&nbsp;your upper tummy, chest or back\n- a persistent&nbsp;cough\n- hoarseness\n- tiredness,&nbsp;shortness of breath&nbsp;and pale skin\n- vomiting blood&nbsp;or&nbsp;coughing up blood&nbsp;– although this is uncommon\nSpeak to your GP if you experience:\n- swallowing difficulties\n- heartburn on most days for three weeks or more\n- any other unusual or persistent symptoms\nThe symptoms can be caused by&nbsp;several conditions and in many cases won&#8217;t be caused by cancer&nbsp;– but it&#8217;s a good idea to get them checked out.\nRead about&nbsp;how oesophageal cancer is diagnosed\nThe exact cause of oesophageal cancer is unknown, but certain things can increase the risk of it developing.\nGastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)&nbsp;is a condition in which a weakness in the muscles above the stomach means stomach acid can travel up into the oesophagus.\nIn around 1 in 10 people with GORD,&nbsp;repeated damage from stomach acid over many years can eventually cause changes in the cells lining the oesophagus. This is called Barrett&#8217;s oesophagus.\nThese abnormal cells are at an increased risk of becoming cancerous in the future, although the risk is still small.&nbsp;It&#8217;s estimated that 1 in every 10&nbsp;to 20 people with Barrett&#8217;s oesophagus will develop cancer within 10 to 20 years.\nDrinking too much alcohol&nbsp;causes irritation and inflammation in the lining of the oesophagus.\nIf the cells in the lining of your gullet become inflamed,&nbsp;they&#8217;re more likely to become cancerous.\nRead more about&nbsp;alcohol and drinking, including tips on cutting down\nTobacco smoke contains many harmful toxins and chemicals. These substances irritate the cells that make up the lining of the oesophagus, which increases the likelihood that they will become cancerous.\nThe longer you smoke, the greater your risk of developing oesophageal cancer.\nRead more about getting help to stop smoking\nIf you&#8217;re overweight or&nbsp;obese, your risk of developing cancer of the oesophagus is higher than&nbsp;people&nbsp;of a healthy weight.&nbsp;The more overweight you are, the higher the risk.\nThis may be partly because obese people are more at risk of developing GORD and Barrett&#8217;s oesophagus (see above).\nRead more information and advice about losing weight\nNot eating enough fruit and vegetables may increase your risk of getting oesophageal cancer.\nYou should aim to eat at least 5 portions of fresh fruit and vegetables every day.\nRead more about having&nbsp;a healthy diet\nCertain rare medical conditions can also increase your chances of developing cancer of the oesophagus, including:\n- achalasia&nbsp;– where&nbsp;the&nbsp;oesophagus loses the ability to move food along, causing vomiting and acid reflux\n- Paterson-Brown Kelly syndrome (also called Plummer Vinson syndrome) –&nbsp;a condition that can cause&nbsp;iron deficiency anaemia and small growths in the throat&nbsp;\n- tylosis – an inherited skin condition\nSpeak to your GP if you experience symptoms of oesophageal cancer. They will carry out an initial assessment and decide whether you need to have any further tests.\nYour GP may:\n- ask about the symptoms you&#8217;re experiencing\n- carry out a physical examination\n- take a look at your medical history\nIf&nbsp;your GP&nbsp;thinks you need to have some tests, they can refer you to a hospital specialist. This will usually be a gastroenterologist (specialist in conditions affecting the digestive system).\nThe 2 main tests used to&nbsp;diagnose oesophageal cancer are:\n- an&nbsp;endoscopy&nbsp;– this is the most common test\n- a barium swallow or barium meal\nAn endoscopy is a procedure that allows your doctor to see inside your oesophagus so they can check for&nbsp;cancer.\nA&nbsp;thin, flexible&nbsp;tube with a&nbsp;light and camera at the end&nbsp;(an endoscope) is passed into your mouth and down towards your stomach.\nSmall samples of tissue are also removed from&nbsp;your oesophagus so they can be checked for cancer under a microscope. This is called a biopsy.\nYou&#8217;ll be awake while&nbsp;an endoscopy is carried out. It shouldn&#8217;t be painful, but may be a bit uncomfortable.\nYou&#8217;ll normally be given local anaesthetic&nbsp;to numb your throat&nbsp;and possibly a&nbsp;sedative to help you relax.\nA barium swallow or barium meal involves drinking a harmless white liquid called barium before several&nbsp;X-rays&nbsp;are taken.\nThe barium coats the lining of your oesophagus so it shows up on the X-ray. This can show whether there&#8217;s anything blocking&nbsp;your oesophagus, which may be a sign of cancer.\nThis test isn&#8217;t used to diagnose oesophageal cancer very often nowadays because the best way to confirm a diagnosis is to use tissue samples taken during an endoscopy.\nIf&nbsp;you have oesophageal cancer, further tests will&nbsp;be&nbsp;recommended to determine how far the cancer has spread&nbsp;– known as called the &#8216;stage&#8217;.&nbsp;\nThese tests may include:\n- a computerised tomography (CT) scan&nbsp;– where a series of X-rays are taken and put together by a computer to create a detailed picture of the inside of your body\n- an endoscopic ultrasound scan&nbsp;– where a small probe&nbsp;that produces sound waves is passed down your throat to create an image of your oesophagus and the surrounding area\n- a positron emission tomography (PET) scan&nbsp;– a scan that can help show how far the cancer has spread\n- a&nbsp;laparoscopy&nbsp;– a type of keyhole surgery performed under general anaesthetic&nbsp;(where you&#8217;re asleep), in which a thin tube with a camera at the end is inserted through a cut in your skin to examine the area around your oesophagus\nThe most widely used system for staging oesophageal cancer is the TNM system. This involves scoring the cancer in 3 categories:\n- T (tumour) – the location and size of the tumour\n- N (node) – whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes (a network of glands throughout the body)\n- M (metastasis) – whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs, liver or bones\nScores for each&nbsp;category are then often used in a simpler number system, ranging from stage 1 (early cancer) to stage 4 (advanced cancer).\nKnowing the stage of your cancer will help your&nbsp;care team&nbsp;work out the best treatment for you.\nRead more about treatments for oesophageal cancer\nRead further information:\n- Cancer Research UK: Getting diagnosed with oesophageal cancer\n- Cancer Research UK: Stages, types and grades of oesophageal cancer\n- Macmillan Cancer Support: Oesophageal cancer\n- Macmillan Cancer Support: Staging and grading of oesophageal cancer\nThe main treatments for oesophageal cancer are surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.\nYou&#8217;ll be cared for by a group of different healthcare professionals and your team will recommend a treatment plan they feel is most suitable for you,&nbsp;although final treatment decisions will be yours.\nYour plan will largely depend on how far your cancer has spread&nbsp;– known as the &#8216;stage&#8217;.\n- stage 1 to 3 oesophageal cancer is usually treated&nbsp;with surgery to remove the affected section of oesophagus&nbsp;(oesophagectomy) – chemotherapy and sometimes radiotherapy may be given before surgery to make it more effective or is sometimes used instead of surgery\n- stage 4 oesophageal cancer has usually spread too far for a cure to be possible, but chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other treatments can slow the spread of the cancer and relieve symptoms\nThere are 3 main types of surgery for oesophageal cancer.\nAn oesophagectomy is the&nbsp;main treatment for early-stage oesophageal cancer.\nDuring the procedure, your surgeon will remove the section of your oesophagus that contains the tumour and, if necessary, the nearby lymph nodes.&nbsp;A small portion of your stomach may also need to be removed.\nThe remaining section of your oesophagus&nbsp;is then&nbsp;reconnected to your stomach.\nTo access your oesophagus, your surgeon will either make incisions (cuts) in your&nbsp;tummy and chest, or in your&nbsp;tummy and neck.\nA procedure called&nbsp;endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR)&nbsp;may sometimes be an option instead of&nbsp;an oesophagectomy if oesophageal cancer is diagnosed very early on.\nIt involves&nbsp;cutting out&nbsp;the tumour using a loop of wire at the end of a thin flexible tube (endoscope). The endoscope is passed down your throat so no incisions are made in your skin.\nSometimes radiowaves may also be used to destroy the cancerous tissue (called radiofrequency ablation or RFA).\nFor more advanced cases of oesophageal cancer that are causing swallowing difficulties,&nbsp;a procedure to insert a hollow tube called a stent into the oesophagus may be recommended.\nThe stent expands once in place and holds the oesophagus open.\nChemotherapy&nbsp;involves taking medicines that kill the cancer cells or stop them multiplying.\nIt may be used:\n- before and sometimes after surgery, either&nbsp;with or without radiotherapy&nbsp;– to shrink the cancer and reduce the&nbsp;risk of it coming back\n- instead of surgery&nbsp;– in&nbsp;combination with radiotherapy (called chemoradiation)\n- to relieve your symptoms if&nbsp;curative treatment&nbsp;isn&#8217;t possible\nThe medicines can be&nbsp;given into a vein&nbsp;or taken as tablets. You&#8217;ll usually have the treatment&nbsp;every 3 weeks&nbsp;over a&nbsp;period of&nbsp;6&nbsp;to 18 weeks.\nCommon side effects of chemotherapy include:\n- feeling sick\n- loss of appetite\n- losing weight\n- diarrhoea\n- feeling very tired\n- increased risk of&nbsp;infections\n- bleeding and bruising easily\nThese side effects should improve gradually after treatment stops.&nbsp;\nRead more about the side effects of chemotherapy\nRadiotherapy&nbsp;involves using&nbsp;radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumours.\nIt may be used:\n- in combination with chemotherapy before surgery&nbsp;– to shrink the cancer and reduce the&nbsp;risk of it coming back\n- instead of surgery&nbsp;– usually in combination with chemotherapy (called chemoradiation)\n- to relieve&nbsp;your symptoms if curative treatment isn&#8217;t possible\nRadiotherapy is most often given using an external machine that directs beams of radiation at your oesophagus, or sometimes by temporarily placing a small piece of radioactive material in your oesophagus (brachytherapy).\nCommon side effects of radiotherapy include:\n- tiredness\n- temporary soreness when swallowing\n- temporary worsening of swallowing difficulties\n- a dry throat\n- feeling or being sick\n- reddening of the skin and loss of body hair in the treatment area\nThese side effects should improve gradually after treatment stops.&nbsp;\nRead more about the side effects of radiotherapy\nRead further information:\n- Cancer Research UK: Treatment for oesophageal cancer\n- Macmillan Cancer Support: Treatment for oesophageal cancer\nHaving oesophageal cancer can have a big impact on your life, but support is available to help you cope.\nYou may have&nbsp;swallowing difficulties&nbsp;during and after treatment for oesophageal cancer.\nThere are treatments that can help – including surgery to place a hollow tube (stent) in your oesophagus,&nbsp;or a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy&nbsp;– although they may not work immediately.\nYou might need to have a temporary feeding tube placed or fluids given through a drip inserted in a vein to begin with, before moving onto fluids by mouth and soft foods.

        "description": "Oral thrush is a fungal infection of the mouth. It&#8217;s not contagious and is usually successfully treated with antifungal medication.\nIt&#8217;s also called oral candidosis (or candiasis) because it&#8217;s caused by a group of yeasts called Candida.\nYou develop symptoms of oral thrush, which can include:\nIn some cases, the symptoms of oral thrush can make eating and drinking difficult.\nIf left untreated, the symptoms will often persist and your mouth will continue to feel uncomfortable.\nIn severe cases that are left untreated, there is also a risk of the infection spreading further into your body, which can be serious.\nYour GP will usually&nbsp;be able to diagnose oral thrush simply by examining your mouth. Sometimes they may also recommend blood tests to look for certain conditions associated with oral thrush, such as&nbsp;diabetes and nutritional deficiencies.\nLow numbers of the fungus Candida are naturally found in the mouth and digestive system of most people. They don&#8217;t usually cause any problems, but can lead to oral thrush if they multiply.\nThere are a number of reasons why this may happen, including:\n- taking a course of antibiotics, particularly over a long period or at a high dose\n- taking&nbsp;inhaled corticosteroid medication&nbsp;for asthma\n- wearing&nbsp;dentures (false teeth), particularly if they don&#8217;t fit properly\n- having poor&nbsp;oral hygiene\n- having a dry mouth, either because of a medical&nbsp;condition or a medication you are taking\n- smoking\n- having&nbsp;chemotherapy or&nbsp;radiotherapy to treat cancer\nBabies, young children and elderly people are at a particularly high risk of developing oral thrush, as are people with certain underlying conditions, including diabetes, an iron deficiency or vitamin B12 deficiency, an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) and&nbsp;HIV.\nAs most people already have Candida fungi living in their mouth, oral thrush is not contagious. This means it cannot be passed to others.\nOral thrush can usually be successfully treated with antifungal medicines. These usually come in the form of gels or liquid that you apply directly inside your mouth (topical medication), although tablets or capsules are sometimes used.\nTopical medication will usually need to be used several times a day for around&nbsp;7 to 14 days. Tablet or capsules are usually taken once daily.\nThese medications don&#8217;t often&nbsp;have side effects, although some can cause&nbsp;nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, bloating, abdominal (tummy) pain and diarrhoea.\nIf antibiotics or corticosteroids are thought to be causing your oral thrush, the medicine&nbsp;– or the way it is delivered&nbsp;– may need to be changed or the dosage reduced.\nThere are a number of things you can do to reduce your chances of developing oral thrush.\nIf you have a condition or are receiving treatment that could put you at a high risk of developing oral thrush, your doctor&nbsp;may recommend taking a course of antifungal medication to prevent this happening."

        "description": "Osteoarthritis is a condition that causes the joints to become painful and stiff. It is the most common type of arthritis in the UK.\nThe main symptoms of osteoarthritis are pain and stiffness in your joints. This can make it difficult to move the affected joints and do certain activities.\nThe symptoms may come and go, which can be related to things&nbsp;like your activity levels and even the weather. In more severe cases, the symptoms can be continuous.\nOther symptoms you or your&nbsp;healthcare professional may notice include:\n- joint tenderness\n- increased pain and stiffness when you have not moved your joints for a while\n- joints appearing slightly larger or more &#8216;knobbly&#8217; than usual\n- a grating or crackling sound or sensation in your joints\n- limited range of movement in your joints\n- weakness and loss of muscle bulk\nOsteoarthritis can affect any joint in the body. The most common areas affected are the knees, hips, and small joints in the hands. Often, you will only experience symptoms in one joint or a few joints at any one time.\nAs you age the tissues around your joints age too. This natural aging can sometimes develop into osteoarthritis.\nWith osteoarthritis, some of the cartilage (the protective surface that allows your joints to move smoothly) in the joint can be lost. Bony growths can develop, and the area can become slightly inflamed (red and swollen).\nThese changes are what cause the typical symptoms of pain, stiffness and swelling.\nThe exact causes are not known&nbsp;There are several factors thought to increase your risk of developing the condition.\nThese include:\n- joint injury\n- other conditions such as&nbsp;rheumatoid arthritis&nbsp;or&nbsp;gout\n- age &#8211; most cases affect adults who are 45 or older\n- family history\n- obesity\nAlthough it&#8217;s not possible to prevent, making some lifestyle changes can reduce your risk of osteoarthritis. Maintaining a healthy weight may lower your chances of developing the condition.\nThere&#8217;s no definitive test to diagnose osteoarthritis. Your GP or healthcare professional will ask about your symptoms. They&#8217;ll also examine your joints to help determine whether you have the condition.\nThey may suspect osteoarthritis if you:\nIf your symptoms are different from those listed above, this may&nbsp;mean that you have another joint condition.\nAn X-ray can help doctors to assess the level of damage to your joints. An X-ray is not currently recommended for diagnosis of osteoarthritis.\nExercise is one of the most important ways of managing osteoarthritis, whatever your age or level of fitness. Specific exercises that help strengthen the muscles and joints are recommended.\nSome people worry that exercising will increase their pain and cause further joint damage. This is not the case. Exercise can improve osteoarthritis, benefit the joints and reduce pain.\nRead about exercises for the hip\nRead about exercises for the knee\nRead about exercises for the thumb\nExercise can also help ease symptoms because it can:\n- help you lose weight\n- improve your posture\n- relieve stress\nRead more about keeping active\nMaintaining a healthy weight can be important part of treatment.

They also come with potentially harmful side affects. If your pain remains at a high level you should discuss your options with a healthcare professional.\nCorticosteroids are medicines that help reduce pain and inflammation. They may also be given with a&nbsp;local anaesthetic.\nInjections will not cure your condition but can occasionally be used to help with short term pain relief when other treatments have been ineffective. There are risks associated with having this procedure, it can contribute to a deterioration in arthritis.\nRead more about corticosteroids\nManual therapy is a treatment provided by a healthcare professional. It uses stretching techniques to keep your joints supple and flexible.\nThis should only be used alongside exercise, not as a replacement for it.\nIf your osteoarthritis causes mobility problems or difficulty performing everyday tasks, supportive&nbsp;devices could help.\nThere are a variety of tools and aids to assist you in your everyday activities. If you feel these would help you, you should speak to your healthcare professional.\nThere is limited benefit to other therapies and devices that are often promoted or sold online.

It&#8217;s often only diagnosed when a minor fall or sudden impact causes a bone to fracture or break.\nThe most common fractures in people with osteoporosis are:\n- wrist fractures\n- hip fractures\n- fractures of the spinal bones (vertebrae)\nFractures can also occur in other bones, like in the arm or pelvis. Rarely, a cough or sneeze can cause a rib fracture, or partial collapse or fracture of one of the bones of the spine.\nOsteoporosis isn’t usually painful until a fracture occurs. But, spinal fractures can be a common cause of long-term (chronic) pain.\nA fracture is normally the first sign of osteoporosis. But, some older people might develop a stooped (bent forward) posture. This happens when several bones in the spine have fractured. That makes it difficult for your spine to support the weight of your body.\nOsteoporosis affects over 3 million people in the UK. Half of women over 50 years and 1 third of men over 60 years of age will have a low trauma fracture due to osteoporosis.\nA low trauma fracture is a fracture that happens from minimal force like:\n- falling onto your wrist\n- picking up a bag of shopping\n- falling from a standing height\nOver 500,000 people need hospital treatment every year for fragility fractures. These are caused by osteoporosis. Fragility fractures are fractures that occur from standing height or less.\nLosing bone density is a normal part of the ageing process. Some people lose bone density much faster than normal. This can lead to osteoporosis and an increased risk of fractures.\nWomen lose bone quickly in the first few years after the menopause. Women are more at risk of osteoporosis than men, particularly if the menopause begins early (before the age of 45).\nIn most cases, the cause of osteoporosis in men is unknown. The risk of osteoporosis is higher in men with low levels of the male hormone testosterone.\nOther hormone-related conditions that can trigger osteoporosis include:\n- hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid gland)\n- disorders of the adrenal glands, such as Cushing’s syndrome\n- disorders of the pituitary gland\n- hyperparathyroidism (overactivity of the parathyroid glands)\nOther factors thought to increase the risk of osteoporosis and broken bones include:\n- a family history of osteoporosis\n- a parental history of hip fracture\n- a body mass index (BMI) of 19 or less\n- long-term use of oral corticosteroids which can affect bone strength\n- having an eating disorder, such as anorexia or bulimia\n- heavy drinking and smoking\n- rheumatoid arthritis\n- Coeliac disease and Crohn’s disease which means people have difficulty digesting or absorbing nutrients from food\n- some medications used to treat breast cancer and prostate cancer which affect hormone levels\n- long periods of inactivity, such as long-term bed rest\nYou can read more about who’s at risk of osteoporosis and broken bones on the Royal Osteoporosis Society website.\nIf your doctor suspects you have osteoporosis, they can make an assessment using an online programme, like FRAX or Q-Fracture.\nIf you&#8217;re between 40 and 90, these tools help to predict your risk of fracture in the hip, spine, shoulder or forearm.\nBoth the public and healthcare professionals can use the FRAX tool.\nYour doctor may also refer you for a DXA (DEXA) scan to measure your bone mineral density. It&#8217;s a painless procedure that takes 5 to 10 minutes, depending on the part of the body being scanned.\nYour bone density can be compared to that of a healthy young adult. The difference is calculated as a standard deviation (SD) and is called a T score.\nYour score will tell you if your bone density is normal, if you have osteopenia or if you have osteoporosis. Your doctor can explain this with your results.\nIf your bone density is lower, but not by enough to classed as osteoporosis, you might be diagnosed with osteopenia.\nTreatment for osteoporosis includes:\n- treating and preventing fractures\n- taking medication to strengthen bones\nThe decision about whether you need treatment depends on your risk of fracture.\nIf you need treatment, your doctor can suggest the safest and most effective treatment plan for you.\nA number of different medications are used to treat osteoporosis. Your doctor will discuss the treatments available and make sure the medicines are right for you.\nBisphosphonates slow down the rate at which bone is broken down in your body. This maintains bone density and reduces the risk of fracture.\nThere are a number of different bisphosphonates, including\n- alendronate\n- ibandronate\n- risedronate\n- zolendronic acid\nThey’re given as a tablet or injection.\nRead the leaflet that comes with your medicine for information about dosage and possible side effects.\nStrontium ranelate appears to have an effect on both the cells that break down bone and the cells that create new bone (osteoblasts).\nIt can be used as an alternative treatment if bisphosphonates are unsuitable. Strontium ranelate is taken as a powder dissolved in water.\nThe main side effects of strontium ranelate are nausea and diarrhoea. A few people have reported a rare severe allergic reaction to the treatment. If you develop a skin rash while taking strontium ralenate, stop taking it and speak to your doctor immediately.\nSERMs are medications that have a similar effect on bone as the hormone oestrogen. They help to maintain bone density and reduce the risk of fracture, particularly of the spine.\nRaloxifene is the only type of SERM that’s available for treating osteoporosis. It’s taken as a tablet every day.\nSide effects associated with raloxifene include:\n- hot flushes\n- leg cramps\n- a potential increased risk of blood clots\nParathyroid hormone is produced naturally in the body. It regulates the amount of calcium in bone.\nParathyroid hormone treatments (human recombinant parathyroid hormone or teriparatide) are used to stimulate cells that create new bone (osteoblasts). You inject it yourself daily.\nWhile other medication can only slow down the rate of bone thinning, parathyroid hormone can increase bone density. However, it’s only used in a small number of people whose bone density is very low and when other treatments aren’t working.\nNausea and vomiting are common side effects of the treatment. Parathyroid hormone treatments should only be prescribed by a specialist.\nRomosozumab is a type of medication called a monoclonal antibody. You inject it yourself every month for 12 months. It helps the cells that build bone whilst slowing the cells that breakdown bone.\nIt&#8217;s suitable for you if you have severe osteoporosis with a high risk of further fractures.\nCalcium is the main mineral found in bone. Having enough calcium as part of a healthy, balanced diet helps keep bones healthy.\nFor most healthy adults, the recommended amount of calcium is 700 milligrams (mg) of calcium a day. Most people should be able to get this from a varied diet that contains good sources of calcium.\nHowever, if you have osteoporosis you may need more calcium, which will usually be in the form of supplements. Ask your GP for advice about taking calcium supplements.\nYou need vitamin D to help your body absorb calcium. There aren&#8217;t many foods that contain vitamin D, so it&#8217;s difficult to get enough from diet alone. A main source of vitamin D is sunlight.\nMore information on Vitamin D\nHormone replacement therapy (HRT) is a treatment used to relieve symptoms of the menopause.\nHRT can also help to maintain bone density and reduce the risk of fracture during treatment.\nHowever, HRT isn’t specifically recommended for treating osteoporosis and it isn’t often used for this purpose. When prescribed for this purpose, it is used around the time of the menopause for up to 5 years.\nRead the leaflet that comes with your medicine for information about dosage and possible side effects.\nIn men, testosterone treatment can be useful when osteoporosis is caused by low levels of testosterone.\nYour genes are responsible for determining your height and the strength of your skeleton, but lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise influence how healthy your bones are.\nIf you’re at risk of developing osteoporosis, you should take steps to help keep your bones healthy. This includes:\n- taking regular exercise\n- healthy eating – including foods rich in calcium and vitamin D\n- making lifestyle changes – like stopping smoking and reducing how much alcohol you drink\nRead more about healthy bones on the Royal Osteoporosis Society website.\nIf you’re diagnosed with osteoporosis, there are things you can do to reduce your chances of a fall like:\n- removing hazards from your home `\n- having regular eye examinations and hearing tests\nMore information on preventing falls\nTo help you recover from a fracture, you can try using:\n- hot and cold treatments like warm baths and cold packs\n- TENS unit – where a small battery-operated device is used to reduce pain by stimulating the nerves\n- relaxation techniques\nSpeak to your GP or nurse if you’re worried about living with a long-term condition. They can help to answer any questions you have.\nYou may also find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor or psychologist, or other people with the condition.\nThe Royal Osteoporosis Society can put you in touch with local support groups."

        "disease": "Osteosarcoma",
        "description": "Osteosarcoma is a type of bone cancer. Osteosarcomas occur more commonly in older children and teenagers and are very rarely seen in children under 5.\nMore children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments. But it remains devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming. There are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.\nUnderstanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. Your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information. If you have any questions it’s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.\nOsteosarcoma often starts at the end of the long bones, where new bone tissue forms as a young person grows. Any bone in the body can be affected. The most common sites are in the arms and legs, particularly around the knee and shoulder joints.\nThere are several different types of osteosarcoma. Most occur in the centre of the bone. There are also rare subtypes, such as parosteal, periosteal, telangiectatic, and small cell osteosarcoma.\nThere has been a lot of research into the causes of osteosarcoma but, like most childhood cancers, a definite cause is unknown. There are a few risk factors that have been associated with osteosarcoma. Children who have hereditary&nbsp;retinoblastoma&nbsp;(a rare tumour of the eye) have an increased risk of developing osteosarcoma. Children who have previously had radiotherapy and chemotherapy also have an increased risk of developing osteosarcoma. It is not caused by injuries or damage to the bone, although an injury may draw attention to a bone tumour.\nPain in the affected bone is the most common symptom. This pain may initially come and go, and then gradually become more severe and constant especially at night. There may also be swelling around the affected bone. Osteosarcoma is sometimes discovered when a bone that has been weakened by cancer breaks after the person has had a minor fall or accident. Some patients may develop a limp if the tumour is in the leg or pelvis.\nThese symptoms can be caused by many things other than cancer. However, any persistent bone pain should be checked by your child’s doctor. Symptoms are often attributed to a sporting injury.\nUsually you begin by seeing your GP, who will examine your child and may arrange tests or X-rays.&nbsp;If a bone tumour is suspected, the doctor will refer your child directly to a specialist hospital or bone tumour centre for further tests.\nThe doctor at the hospital will take your child’s full medical history. They will then do a physical examination. This will include an examination of the painful bone to check for any swelling or tenderness. Your child will probably have a blood test to check their general health.\nA variety of tests and investigations may be needed to diagnose osteosarcoma. An X-ray of the painful part of the bone will usually identify a tumour, although sometimes they can be difficult to see.\nA small piece of the tumour will be removed and looked at under a microscope. This is called a biopsy. It’s a small operation, performed under a general anaesthetic.\nOther tests are done to check whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. These include a chest&nbsp;X-ray,&nbsp;blood tests, a bone scan and an&nbsp;MRI&nbsp;or&nbsp;CT scan.\nAny tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you.\nGrading refers to the appearance of the cancer cells under the microscope, and gives an idea of how quickly the cancer may develop. Low-grade cancer cells are usually slow-growing and less likely to spread.\nIn high-grade tumours the cells are likely to grow quickly and are more likely to spread.\nMost osteosarcomas are high-grade, but a type known as parosteal osteosarcoma is usually low-grade.\nThe ‘stage’ of a cancer is a term used to describe its size and whether it has spread beyond its original site. Knowing the particular type and stage of the cancer helps the doctors to decide on the most appropriate treatment.\nMost patients are grouped depending on whether cancer is found in only one part of the body (localised disease), or whether the cancer has spread from one part of the body to another (metastatic disease).\nA staging system commonly used for osteosarcomas is described below:\nThe cancer is low-grade and is only found within the hard coating of the bone.\nThe cancer is low-grade, extending outside the bone and into the soft tissue spaces that contain nerves and blood vessels.\nThe cancer is high-grade and is completely contained within the hard coating of the bone.\nThe cancer is high-grade and has spread outside the bone and into surrounding soft tissue spaces that contain nerves and blood vessels. Most osteosarcomas are stage 2B.\nThe cancer can be low or high-grade and is either found within the bone or extends outside the bone. The cancer has spread to other parts of the body, or to other bones not directly connected to the bone where the tumour started.\nIf the cancer comes back after initial treatment, this is known as recurrent or relapsed cancer.\nTreatment will depend on a number of factors including the size, position, and stage of the tumour.\nChemotherapy&nbsp;is a very important part of treatment for osteosarcoma. Chemotherapy uses anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells, and is usually given to shrink the main tumour before surgery. It’s also given after the tumour has been removed by surgery, to help reduce the risk of the cancer coming back (recurring). It’s common for a combination of drugs to be used.\nRadiotherapy&nbsp;may occasionally be given. This treats cancer by using high energy rays to destroy the cancer cells, while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells.\nThe type and extent of surgery depends on the position and size of the tumour in the body. This surgery will need to be carried out at a specialist orthopaedic centre, and your child should be referred to one.\nSurgery may include removing the whole limb (amputation) or part of the affected bone, which is then replaced by some form of false limb (prosthesis). If only part of the affected bone is removed, this is known as limb-sparing surgery. Most children will be considered for limb-sparing surgery.\nSometimes amputation of the limb is unavoidable if the cancer is affecting the surrounding blood vessels and nerves.\nAfter amputation, a false limb will be fitted and will be regularly adjusted as your child grows. False limbs can work very well. It should be possible for your child to join in with normal activities and even sports.\nThere are 2 ways that limb-sparing surgery may be done:\n- replacing the bone with a prosthesis (a specially designed artificial part)\n- replacing the affected bone with bone taken from another part of the body (bone graft)\nAfter this type of surgery, children will usually be able to use their limbs almost normally. However, they are advised not to participate in any contact sports. This is because any damage to the bone graft or prosthesis may require another major operation to repair or replace it.\nIf your child is growing, the limb prosthesis will need to be lengthened as the bone grows. This may mean there are extra short stays in hospital, although some prostheses can be lengthened as an outpatient procedure.\nMifamurtide, also called Mepact®, is a new type of biological therapy treatment. It may be offered to your child if they have had a surgical resection to remove the osteosarcoma and the tumour has not spread. It will be given along with chemotherapy after surgery to try and stop the osteosarcoma coming back. Mifamurtide is a relatively new drug and so more research needs to be done to fully understand its side effects and how to use it best.\nTreatment often causes side effects, and your child’s doctor will discuss these with you before the treatment starts. Any possible side effects will depend upon the treatment being given and the part of the body that’s being treated.\nSome general side effects of chemotherapy can include:\n- feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting)\n- hair loss\n- increased risk of infection bruising and bleeding tiredness\n- diarrhoea\nRadiotherapy can cause irritation or soreness of the skin in the area being treated and general tiredness.\nIf your child is having surgery, the surgeon will explain the possible complications of the surgery that your child is having.\nA small number of children may develop late side effects, sometimes many years later. These include a reduction in bone growth, reduced fertility, a change in heart function, and a slight increase in the risk of developing another cancer in later life.\nYour child’s doctor or nurse will talk to you and monitor your child for any potential late effects.\nMany children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial, if there is a suitable one open. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. Specialist doctors carry out trials for children’s cancer. If appropriate, your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial, and will answer any questions you have. Written information will be provided to help explain things.\nTaking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide if it’s right for your child. Your child’s doctor can tell you if there are any trials available that might be suitable for your child.\nSometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child’s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The&nbsp;Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group&nbsp;(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.\nMany children with osteosarcoma are cured. However, your child may need to have surgery to lengthen the affected limb as they grow. Your child will have regular check-ups and X-rays in the paediatric or adolescent oncology clinic, and at the orthopaedic centre.\nIf you have specific concerns about your child’s condition and treatment, it’s best to discuss them with your child’s doctor, who knows the situation in detail."

        "disease": "Outer ear infection (otitis externa)",
        "description": "Otitis externa is an infection that causes inflammation (redness and swelling) of the ear canal, which is the tube between the outer ear and the eardrum.\nOtitis externa is often called &#8216;swimmer’s ear&#8217; because regularly getting water in your ear can make inflammation more likely.\nSymptoms of otitis externa include:\n- ear pain\n- itching and irritation in and around your ear canal\n- redness and swelling of your outer ear and ear canal\n- a feeling of pressure and fullness inside your ear\n- scaly skin in and around your ear canal, which may peel off\n- discharge from your ear, which can be either thin and watery or thick and pus-like\n- tenderness when you move your ear or jaw\n- swollen and sore glands in your throat\n- some hearing loss\nUsually, only one ear is affected.\nWith treatment, these symptoms should clear up within a few days. Some cases can persist for several months or longer.\nPharmacists can give advice and treatment about outer ear infections.\nYour pharmacist may advise you to speak to your GP practice if needed.\nYour pharmacist or GP will ask about your symptoms and whether you regularly put things into your ears, such as hearing aids or ear plugs. They may also examine inside your ear using an instrument called an otoscope.\nIf you have otitis externa often, and treatment doesn&#8217;t help, your GP may take a swab of the inside of your ear. This will be tested to help check what type of infection you have, if any, so the right medication can be prescribed.\nMost cases of otitis externa are caused by a bacterial infection. It can also be caused by:\n- irritation\n- fungal infections\n- allergies\nThere are a things that can make you more likely to develop otitis externa, including:\n- damaging the skin inside your ear – for example by scratching or picking your ear\n- regularly getting water in your ear – for example by swimming\nGetting water in your ear can cause you to scratch inside your ear, and the moisture also provides an ideal environment for bacteria to grow.\nOtitis externa is quite common. It’s estimated that around 1 in 10 people will be affected by it at some point in their lives.\nThe condition is slightly more common in women than men and is most often diagnosed in adults 45 to 75 years of age.\nPeople with certain long-term (chronic) conditions are at greater risk of developing the condition. These include:\n- eczema\n- dermatitis\nOtitis externa sometimes gets better without treatment, but it can take several weeks.\nTo help your symptoms and help prevent complications, you should:\n- avoid getting your affected ear wet – wearing a shower cap while showering and bathing if you aren&#8217;t washing your hair can help\n- avoid swimming until the condition has fully cleared\n- remove any discharge by gently swabbing your outer ear with cotton wool – do not stick cotton wool or a cotton bud inside your ear\n- remove anything from your affected ear that may cause an allergic reaction, such as hearing aids, ear plugs and earrings\n- use pain relief such as paracetamol or ibuprofen to relieve ear pain – these aren’t suitable for everyone, so make sure you check the information leaflet that comes with the medication first and if you’re still unsure, check with your GP, practice nurse or pharmacist\n- if your condition is caused by a boil in your ear, placing a warm flannel or cloth over the affected ear can help it heal faster\nYour pharmacist or GP can prescribe ear drops that usually improve symptoms within a few days.\nThere are different types of ear drops that may be used to treat otitis externa. You usually use them several times a day for about a week.\nYour GP may refer you to a specialist for further treatment and advice if your symptoms are severe, or treatment does not help.\nThere are things you can do to reduce your chances of developing otitis externa.\nYou should also try to avoid getting water, soap or shampoo into your ears when you have a shower or bath."

        "disease": "Ovarian cancer",
        "description": "Ovarian cancer is most common in women and anyone with ovaries who has&nbsp;been through&nbsp;the&nbsp;menopause&nbsp;(usually over the age of 50). It can affect women and anyone with ovaries of any age.\nAs the&nbsp;symptoms of ovarian cancer can be similar to those of other conditions, it can be difficult to recognise. However, there are early symptoms to look out for, such as&nbsp;persistent bloating, pain in the pelvis and lower stomach, and difficulty eating.\nIt&#8217;s important to speak to your GP if you experience these symptoms, particularly over a&nbsp;long period of time. Read more about how ovarian cancer is diagnosed.\nThe ovaries are a pair of small organs in the female reproductive system that contain and release an egg once a month. This is known as ovulation.\nDifferent types of ovarian cancer affect different parts of the ovaries. Epithelial ovarian cancer, which affects the surface layers of the ovary, is the most common type. This topic focuses on epithelial ovarian cancer.\nThe exact cause of ovarian cancer is unknown, but certain things are thought to increase a woman&#8217;s risk of developing the condition, such as age, the number of eggs the ovaries release and whether someone in your family has had ovarian or breast cancer in the past.&nbsp;However, only 1 in 10 cases of ovarian cancer has a genetic link.\nRead more about the causes of ovarian cancer\nThe treatment you receive for ovarian cancer will depend on several things, including the stage of your&nbsp;cancer and your general health. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for ovarian cancer, but your treatment will usually involve a combination of surgery and chemotherapy.\nRead more about how ovarian cancer is treated\nAs with most types of cancer, the outlook for ovarian cancer will depend on the stage it&#8217;s at when diagnosed – that is, how far the cancer has advanced.\nBeing diagnosed with&nbsp;ovarian cancer can affect daily life in many ways. However, support is available for many aspects of&nbsp;living with&nbsp;ovarian cancer, including emotional, financial and long-term health issues.\nThere are methods of screening for ovarian cancer but, currently, they haven&#8217;t been fully tested. Screening&nbsp;is only available for women and anyone with ovaries who are at high risk of developing the condition due to a strong family history or inheritance of a particular faulty gene.&nbsp;Clinical trials in the UK are currently being carried out to assess the effectiveness of screening in high-risk groups and in the general population. A cervical screening test, which used to be called a smear test, can&#8217;t detect ovarian cancer.\nRead more about preventing ovarian cancer\nThe symptoms of ovarian cancer can be difficult to recognise, particularly in its early stages.\nThis is because they are often the same as symptoms of other less serious conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS).\nHowever, 3 main symptoms are more frequent:\n- increased abdominal size and persistent bloating (not bloating that comes and goes)\n- persistent pelvic and abdominal pain\n- difficulty eating and feeling full quickly, or feeling nauseous\nOther symptoms, such as back pain,&nbsp;needing to pass urine more frequently than usual, and pain during sex may be the result of other conditions in the pelvic area. However, they may be&nbsp;a sign of ovarian cancer.\nIf you have these types of symptoms, try keeping a diary to record how many of these symptoms you have over a longer period. Bear in mind&nbsp;that ovarian cancer is rare in women and anyone with ovaries under 40 years of age.\nSpeak to your GP if you have these symptoms regularly (on most days for 3 weeks or more). Although it&#8217;s unlikely they&#8217;re being caused by a serious problem, it&#8217;s best to check.\nIf you&#8217;ve already seen your GP and the symptoms continue or get worse, you should go back and explain this. You know your body better than anyone.\nSeveral possible causes of ovarian cancer have been identified, along with risks that may make developing the condition more likely.\nCancer begins with a change (mutation) in the structure of the DNA in cells, which can affect how they grow. This means that cells grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour.\nIn ovarian cancer, cells in the ovary start to change and grow abnormally. If the cancer isn&#8217;t identified at an early stage, it can spread to the abdomen and pelvis, including other parts of the female reproductive system.\nThe exact cause of epithelial ovarian cancer (the main type) isn&#8217;t known, but certain things may increase your risk of developing it.\nYour risk of ovarian cancer increases with age, with most cases occurring after the menopause. Most cases of ovarian cancer occur in women and anyone with ovaries who are over 50 years of age.\nIf you have 2 or more close relatives (mother, sister or daughter) who developed ovarian cancer or breast cancer, your risk of also developing the condition may be increased.\nIf your relatives developed cancer before the age of 50, it&#8217;s more likely it was the result of an inherited faulty gene. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are faulty genes that are linked to ovarian cancer. They&#8217;re also known to increase the risk of breast cancer.\nHaving relatives with ovarian cancer doesn&#8217;t mean you definitely have a faulty gene in the family – the cancer could have happened by chance. Only&nbsp;1 in 10 (10%) of ovarian cancers are thought to be caused by a faulty gene.\nYou may be at high risk of having a faulty gene if you have:\n- 1 relative diagnosed with ovarian cancer at any age and at least 2 close relatives with breast cancer whose average age is under 60; all of these relatives should be on the same side of your family (either your mother&#8217;s&nbsp;or father&#8217;s side)\n- 1 relative diagnosed with ovarian cancer at any age and at least 1 close relative diagnosed with breast cancer under the age of 50; both of these relatives should come from the same side of your family\n- 2 relatives from the same side of the family diagnosed with ovarian cancer at any age&nbsp;\nIf you&#8217;re at a higher risk of having a faulty gene, your GP can refer you for tests to check for faulty BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.\nEvery time an egg is released into the reproductive system, the surface of the ovary breaks to let it out. The surface of the ovary is damaged during this process and needs to be repaired. Each time this happens, there&#8217;s a greater chance of abnormal cell growth during the repair.&nbsp;\nThis may be why the risk of ovarian cancer decreases if you take the contraceptive pill, or have multiple pregnancies or periods of breastfeeding. At these times, eggs aren&#8217;t released.\nThere&#8217;s no strong evidence to show that those who have infertility treatment have an increased risk of developing ovarian cancer. However, it&#8217;s thought that&nbsp;infertility itself may increase ovarian cancer&nbsp;risk and research into this area is being carried out.&nbsp;\nWomen and anyone with ovaries who take&nbsp;hormone replacement therapy (HRT) have been shown to have a small increased risk of developing ovarian cancer. However, if HRT is stopped, after 5 years the risk is reduced to the same level as those who&#8217;ve never taken HRT.\nEndometriosis may also increase your risk of ovarian cancer. In endometriosis, the cells that usually line the womb grow elsewhere in the body.\nThese endometrial cells behave as if they were in the womb, so thickening and bleeding that usually occurs during menstruation,&nbsp;occurs in other parts of the body. There&#8217;s no way for this endometrial tissue to leave the body so it becomes trapped, leading to pain, swelling and bleeding in that area.\nRead further information:\n- Cancer Research UK: Ovarian cancer risks and causes\nSpeak to your GP as soon as possible if you have any symptoms of ovarian cancer.\nYour GP will gently feel your tummy (abdomen) and ask you about your symptoms, general health and whether there&#8217;s a history of ovarian or&nbsp;breast cancer in your family.\nThey may carry out an internal examination and may take a blood sample or refer you for an&nbsp;ultrasound scan.\nIf needed, you may also be referred to a specialist (a gynaecologist or gynaecological oncologist) at a hospital.\nIn 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected ovarian cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral.\nYou may have a blood test to look for a protein called CA125 in your blood. CA125 is produced by some ovarian cancer cells.&nbsp;A very high level of CA125 may indicate that you have ovarian cancer.\nHowever, CA125 isn&#8217;t specific to ovarian cancer and it can be raised in conditions including endometriosis,&nbsp;fibroids, pelvic inflammatory disease&nbsp;and pregnancy, so&nbsp;a raised CA125 level doesn&#8217;t definitely mean you have ovarian cancer.\nThe Lab Tests Online UK website has more information&nbsp;on the CA125 test.\nThe&nbsp;National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has produced&nbsp;guidance that recommends testing for CA125 if you frequently experience:&nbsp;\n- bloating\n- feeling full quickly and/or loss of appetite&nbsp;\n- pelvic or abdominal pain&nbsp;\n- needing to urinate urgently and/or frequently&nbsp;&nbsp;\nRead the full&nbsp;NICE guidance about the recognition and initial management of ovarian cancer (PDF, 179kb).\nIf you experience unexplained weight loss, fatigue or changes in your bowel habits, such as&nbsp;diarrhoea or constipation, you may also be tested for CA125.\nIf you&#8217;re 50 or over and you&#8217;ve experienced symptoms that could suggest&nbsp;irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in the last 12 months, such as bloating, abdominal pain or changes in your bowel habits, your GP should test your CA125 level.\nAround half&nbsp;of all women and anyone with ovaries with early-stage ovarian cancer&nbsp;have a raised level of CA125 in their blood. If your CA125 level is raised,&nbsp;you&#8217;ll be referred for an ultrasound scan.\nAn ultrasound scan uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of your ovaries. You may have an internal ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is inserted into your vagina, or you may have an external ultrasound, where the probe is put next to your stomach.\nThe image produced can show the size and texture of your ovaries, plus any cysts or other swellings that are present.\nIf you&#8217;ve been diagnosed with ovarian cancer, you may have further tests to see how large the cancer is and&nbsp;if it&#8217;s spread. This is called staging.\nOther tests you may have include:\n- a chest X-ray\n- a CT scan&nbsp;or MRI scan\n- abdominal fluid aspiration – a thin needle&nbsp;is passed into your abdomen, so that a fluid sample can be taken and tested for cancerous cells&nbsp;\n- laparoscopy – a thin tube with a camera on the end&nbsp;is&nbsp;inserted through a small incision in your lower abdomen, so that your ovaries can be examined; a small tissue sample may also be taken from your ovaries for testing (a biopsy)\nStaging helps your doctors to decide on the best kind of treatment for your condition. However, it&#8217;s important to remember that the stage of your ovarian cancer alone cannot predict how your condition will progress.\nThe Cancer Research UK website has more information on further tests for ovarian cancer.\nIf your test results indicate that you have ovarian cancer,&nbsp;it will be given a stage. The stage describes the size of the cancer and how far it has spread. The 4 commonly used stages of ovarian cancer are:\n- stage 1 – where the cancer only affects one or both of the ovaries\n- stage 2 – where the cancer has spread from the ovary and into the pelvis or&nbsp;womb\n- stage 3 – where the cancer has spread to the lining of the abdomen, the surface of the bowel and the lymph nodes in the pelvis\n- stage 4 – where the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the&nbsp;liver, spleen or lungs&nbsp;\nThis is a simplified guide. Each stage is further divided into categories A, B and C.&nbsp;Ask your doctor if you&#8217;re not sure what stage you have.\nThe grade of cancer refers to the appearance of&nbsp;cells under a microscope. The grades are as follows:\n- low grade – although abnormal, cells appear to be slow-growing\n- moderate grade – cells look more abnormal than low-grade cells\n- high grade – cells look very abnormal and are likely to be fast-growing\nThe Cancer Research UK website has more information on the stages and grading of ovarian cancer.\nMost people with ovarian cancer will&nbsp;be considered for&nbsp;surgery. It sometimes isn&#8217;t possible to confirm the stage of the cancer until surgery is carried out.\nYour doctor will discuss what will happen during surgery. It will probably involve removing:\n- both ovaries and the fallopian tubes (a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy)\n- the womb&nbsp;(a total abdominal hysterectomy)\n- the omentum – a fatty layer of tissue within the abdomen (an omentectomy)\nThe surgeon may also remove the lymph nodes from your pelvis and abdomen, and samples of nearby tissue, to find out whether the cancer has spread.\nIf it has spread, the surgeon will try to remove as much of it as possible. This is known as &#8216;debulking surgery&#8217;.\nIf the cancer is confined to 1 or both ovaries, you may only need to have the ovary or ovaries removed, leaving your womb intact. This means you may still be able to carry a pregnancy.\nYou will probably be ready to go home 3 to 7 days after your operation, but it can take many weeks to fully recover.\nWhen you go home, you&#8217;ll need to exercise gently to build up your strength and fitness. Walking and swimming are good exercises that are suitable for most people after treatment for ovarian cancer. Discuss the types of exercise that are suitable for you with your doctor or physiotherapist.\nRead further information:\n- Cancer Research UK: Surgery for ovarian cancer\n- Macmillan Cancer Support: Ovarian cancer surgery\nChemotherapy&nbsp;involves using anti-cancer (cytotoxic) medication to kill cancer cells. It&#8217;s often given after surgery for ovarian cancer. In some cases, it can be given before surgery to help shrink the tumour and make it easier to remove. This is called &#8216;neoadjuvant chemotherapy&#8217;.\nSeveral different medicines can be used in chemotherapy. A combination is often given. The choice of medicine and how and when it&#8217;s given depends on the&nbsp;stage of your cancer and how much it has spread. The most common treatment for ovarian cancer is a platinum-containing medicine (carboplatin), which is used alone or in combination with another medicine called paclitaxel.\nChemotherapy is usually given as&nbsp;a drip&nbsp;into the vein, but is sometimes given as tablets. Some studies have looked at giving chemotherapy directly into the abdomen – called &#8216;intraperitoneal chemotherapy&#8217;. It is not currently established routine practice in the UK, but it&#8217;s being assessed in clinical trials.\nYou&#8217;ll usually have chemotherapy as an outpatient, but you may sometimes need a short stay in hospital. It&#8217;s usually given in cycles, with a period of treatment followed by a period of rest, to allow the body to recover. Most women and anyone with ovaries have 6 cycles of chemotherapy.\nOver the course of your chemotherapy, you&#8217;ll have tests to monitor how the cancer is responding to treatment. This can be done in a number of ways. For example:\n- if you had higher than normal levels of the&nbsp;protein CA125 in your blood when diagnosed, you may have blood tests to see whether the levels are falling\n- if you had a tumour visible on a&nbsp;CT scan&nbsp;or ultrasound scan when&nbsp;diagnosed, you may have repeated scans to see whether it has shrunk\n- you may have another small operation, known as &#8216;second-look surgery&#8217;, which is carried out in the same way as a laparoscopy\nAfter your chemotherapy treatment, if all of your tests are clear of cancer, you&#8217;ll be in remission. This means the cancer is under control.\nSide effects&nbsp;of chemotherapy&nbsp;include:\n- infections\n- loss of appetite\n- nausea and vomiting\n- tiredness\n- hair loss&nbsp;\n- sore mouth\nMany side effects can be prevented or controlled with medicines your doctor can prescribe.\nOvarian cancer can come back (relapse) after treatment. If this happens, you may have another course of chemotherapy. This is called &#8216;second-line treatment&#8217;.\nRead further information:\n- Cancer Research UK: Chemotherapy for ovarian cancer\n- Macmillan Cancer Support: Chemotherapy for ovarian cancer\nRadiotherapy&nbsp;uses high energy X-rays. Like chemotherapy, it works by targeting rapidly growing cancer cells.\nRadiotherapy isn&#8217;t usually used to treat ovarian cancer. However, the multidisciplinary team may occasionally recommend&nbsp;it to treat&nbsp;ovarian cancer under very specific circumstances, such as treating pain and bleeding from a localised tumour mass.\nRead further information:\n- Cancer Research UK: Radiotherapy for ovarian cancer\n- Macmillan Cancer Support: Ovarian cancer treatment\nIn recent years,&nbsp;much progress has been made in ovarian cancer treatment. More women and anyone with ovaries are living longer and experiencing fewer side effects. These advances were discovered through&nbsp;clinical trials,&nbsp;where new medicines and combinations of medicines are compared with standard treatment.\nAll cancer trials in the UK are subject to careful monitoring,&nbsp;to ensure the trial is worthwhile and safely conducted. Participants in clinical trials can&nbsp;often do better overall than in routine care.\nIf you&#8217;re asked about taking part in a trial, you&#8217;ll be offered an information sheet. If you wish to take part, you&#8217;ll be asked to give your consent (permission)&nbsp;by signing a form. You&#8217;re always free to refuse or withdraw from a clinical trial without it affecting your care.\nRead further information:\n- Cancer Research: Ovarian cancer research\nDealing with cancer can be a huge challenge for patients and their families. It can bring emotional and practical difficulties.\nIt often helps to talk about your feelings or other difficulties with a trained counsellor or therapist. You can ask for this kind of help at any stage of your illness. There are various ways to find help and support. For example:\n- your hospital doctor, specialist nurse or GP can refer you to a counsellor;&nbsp;talk to your GP if&nbsp;you&#8217;re feeling depressed;&nbsp;a course of&nbsp;antidepressants may help, or your GP can arrange for you to see a counsellor or psychotherapist\n- it can help to talk to someone who&#8217;s been through the same thing as you; many organisations have helplines and online forums; they can also put you in touch with other people who have had cancer treatment\nRead further information:\n- Macmillan Cancer Support\nMany women and anyone with ovaries with ovarian cancer have a hysterectomy. This is a major operation and takes around 6 to 12 weeks to recover from.\nDuring this time, you&#8217;ll have to avoid lifting things, such as children and heavy shopping bags, and doing heavy housework. You won&#8217;t be able to drive for 3 to 8&nbsp;weeks after the operation. You&#8217;ll usually need 4 to 12 weeks off work after a hysterectomy.\nIf your ovaries have been removed and you haven&#8217;t already been through the menopause, you&#8217;ll experience the&nbsp;menopause after your treatment. You may decide to take hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to control your symptoms. Your GP will&nbsp;help you decide what&#8217;s best for you.\nSome treatments for ovarian cancer, particularly chemotherapy, can make you feel very tired. You may need a break from your normal activities for a while. Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask for practical help from family and friends if you need it.\nPractical help may also&nbsp;be available from your local authority. Ask your doctor or nurse who to contact.\nAfter your treatment has finished, you&#8217;ll be invited for regular check-ups to see how well you are responding to treatments. These are usually every 2 to 3 months to begin with.\nHaving cancer isn&#8217;t always easy to talk about, either for you or&nbsp;your family and friends. You may sense that some people avoid you or feel awkward around you.\nBeing open about how you feel and what your family and friends can do to help&nbsp;may put them at ease. However, don&#8217;t feel shy about telling them you need some time to yourself.\nRead further information:\n- Talking to your kids about cancer\n- Macmillan Cancer Support: Talking about cancer\nOvarian cancer and its treatment can affect your sex life in several ways.\nIf you haven&#8217;t already been through the menopause, removing your ovaries means you&#8217;ll have an early menopause. You&#8217;re likely to have symptoms of the menopause, which can include vaginal dryness and loss of sexual desire.\nIt&#8217;s common to lose interest in sex after treatment for ovarian cancer. Your treatment may leave you feeling very tired, and&nbsp;you may feel shocked, confused or depressed about being diagnosed with cancer.\nYou may also feel grief about the loss of your fertility. It&#8217;s understandable that you may not feel like having sex while coping with all this. Share your feelings with your partner. If your feelings about sex aren&#8217;t improving with time, you may want to consider speaking to a counsellor or sex therapist.\nIf you have to reduce or stop working due to your cancer, you may find it difficult to cope financially. If you have cancer or you&#8217;re caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to financial support. For example:\n- if you have a job but can&#8217;t work because of your illness, you&#8217;re entitled to statutory sick pay (SSP) from your employer&nbsp;\n- if you don&#8217;t have a job and can&#8217;t work because of your illness, you may be entitled to employment and support allowance (ESR)\n- if you&#8217;re caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to carer&#8217;s allowance\n- you may be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home, or have a low household income\nIt&#8217;s a good idea to find out&nbsp;as soon as possible&nbsp;what help is available to you. You could ask to speak to the social worker at your hospital, who&nbsp;can&nbsp;give you the information you need.\nRead further information:\n- Money Helper\n- Target Ovarian Cancer: Ovarian cancer and your finances\nIf you&#8217;re told&nbsp;that nothing more can be done to treat your ovarian cancer,&nbsp;care will focus on controlling your symptoms and helping you feel as comfortable as possible. This is called palliative care. It also includes psychological, social and spiritual support for you and your family or carers.\nRead further information:\n- Marie Curie\nThere&#8217;s currently no reliable screening test for ovarian cancer. However, there are a number of things that may help to prevent ovarian cancer.\nEach time you ovulate, your ovaries are damaged by the egg as it breaks through the surface of the ovary and is&nbsp;released into your reproductive system.\nThe cells that make up the surface of your ovaries divide and multiply rapidly to repair the damage caused by the egg. It&#8217;s this rapid cell growth that can occasionally go wrong and result in ovarian cancer.\nAnything that stops the process of ovulation can help to minimise your chances of developing ovarian cancer. This includes:\n- pregnancy&nbsp;and breastfeeding\n- the contraceptive pill\n- hysterectomy surgery (removal of the ovaries)\nOvarian cancer may be linked to being overweight or obese. Losing weight through regular exercise and a healthy, balanced diet may help lower your risk of getting ovarian cancer. Aside from this, regular exercise and a healthy, low-fat diet are extremely beneficial to your overall health, and can help to prevent all forms of cancer and heart disease.\nAt present, there&#8217;s no screening method&nbsp;for ovarian cancer that is reliable enough to be used by all women and anyone with ovaries in the UK.&nbsp;Clinical trials into this are continuing.\nYou may be eligible for screening if you&#8217;re at high risk of developing the condition due to a strong family history, or if you&#8217;ve&nbsp;inherited a&nbsp;specific abnormal gene.\nIf you&#8217;re at high risk, your GP can refer you to your local genetics service or family cancer clinic. You may be screened for ovarian cancer when you&#8217;re&nbsp;over the age of 35, or when you&#8217;re 5 years away from the age at which your youngest relative was diagnosed with the condition. From this point, you&#8217;ll be screened again once a year.\nThe screening tests for ovarian cancer are the same as those routinely used to diagnose it. The tests are:\n- a&nbsp;blood test for higher-than-normal levels of CA125 (a protein produced by cancer cells)\n- a transvaginal ultrasound – where an&nbsp;ultrasound probe is inserted into your vagina so that the size and texture of your ovaries can be seen, as well as any&nbsp;ovarian cysts that may be present\nThe tests are used together to produce results that are as accurate as possible. However, as these screening methods are still in the process of being tested, there&#8217;s no guarantee&nbsp;they&#8217;ll identify every case of ovarian cancer.\nA cervical screening test, previously known as a smear test, can&#8217;t detect ovarian cancer."

        "disease": "Ovarian cancer: Teenagers and young adults",
        "description": "This section is for teenagers and young adults. It’s about a type of cancer called ovarian cancer.\nWe have more info for young people about:\n- germ cell tumours of the ovary – causes and symptoms\n- having tests for ovarian cancer&nbsp;\n- treating ovarian cancer\nFor more information about ovarian cancer in women of all ages, read our general&nbsp;ovarian cancer&nbsp;section.\nOvarian cancer starts in the ovaries, which are part of the reproductive system. This is in the lower part of your tummy (abdomen), in the area between your hips (called the pelvis). Your reproductive system is made up of your vagina and the organs involved in getting pregnant and having a baby.\nYour reproductive system is made up of the:\n- vagina&nbsp;– the passage from the cervix to outside your body\n- cervix&nbsp;– the opening from the womb to the vagina\n- womb (also called uterus)&nbsp;– where a baby grows during pregnancy\n- fallopian tubes&nbsp;– which connect your ovaries to the womb\n- ovaries&nbsp;– which store all your eggs and release one every month after puberty\nYou have&nbsp;2 ovaries&nbsp;– 1 on each side of your womb. They’re about 4cm long.\nAt puberty your ovaries start making hormones called oestrogen and progesterone. These cause your breasts to grow and your periods to start.\nEvery month after puberty, your ovaries release an egg, which travels down the fallopian tubes to the womb. The womb’s lining gets thicker, ready for an egg to be fertilised by a man’s sperm. If this doesn’t happen, the womb’s lining comes out of your vagina as blood. This is a period.\nWhen a woman is about 50 her periods stop because her ovaries have run out of eggs so they stop making hormones. This is called the menopause.\nThere are 3 types of ovarian cancer: epithelial tumours, germ cell tumours and stromal cell tumours.\nTeenagers are mostly affected by the germ cell tumour type. You may hear your type of germ cell tumour being called:\n- dysgerminoma\n- teratoma\n- yolk sac tumour\nGerm cell tumours of the ovary are rare. They start in the egg-producing cells of the ovary. Treatment will usually cure germ cell tumours.\nYour specialist will explain more about the type of germ cell tumour that you have.\nThis section is for teenagers and young adults.\nGerm cell tumours of the ovary are the most common type of ovarian cancer in teenagers and young women.\nGerm cell tumours are a rare type of ovarian cancer. They start in the egg-producing cells of the ovary in girls and young women (aged 10 to 30). Tumours are often only in&nbsp;1 ovary. They can usually be successfully treated, even if they’ve spread to other places in the body.\nGerm cell tumours can also develop in teenage boys’ or men’s testicles, or rarely in other parts of the body. This page is about germ cell tumours that start in the ovary, but we have more information about&nbsp;testicular cancer.\nThe cause of germ cell tumours is unknown. Research into possible causes is going on all the time.\nGerm cells are a normal part of the ovary, but something causes them to change. This makes them grow too quickly and make a tumour.\n- pain or swelling in your tummy (abdomen)&nbsp;\n- a&nbsp;feeling of fullness or bloating in your tummy\n- needing to pee more often\n- irregular periods\nRemember – these symptoms happen for lots of reasons other than cancer. But if you have any of them it’s important to speak to your GP.\nIf you think you might have some of these symptoms, go and see your GP. They&#8217;ll be able to talk to you about your symptoms. If they think they could be because of cancer, they can do some&nbsp;tests&nbsp;to find out more.\nWe have more information for young people about:\n- having tests for ovarian cancer\n- treatment of overian cancer\nIf you&#8217;re looking for information about ovarian cancer in women of all ages, read our general&nbsp;ovarian cancer&nbsp;section.\nThere are some tests that you might have at your doctor&#8217;s or at the hospital, to help them see if you have ovarian cancer.\nIf you think you might have any&nbsp;symptoms of ovarian cancer, you should speak to your GP. They&#8217;ll be able to talk to you about your symptoms. If they think these could be because of cancer they can do tests to find out more.\nThese might include:\n- a&nbsp;blood test\n- an&nbsp;ultrasound&nbsp;of the ovaries\n- an internal examination, to check the organs in your pelvis\nFor an internal examination, you lie on your back with your feet together and your knees apart. The doctor will gently put&nbsp;1 or&nbsp;2 fingers inside your vagina and press a little on your lower tummy. It shouldn’t be painful but it can feel uncomfortable.\nThis test might make you feel embarrassed, but doctors are used to doing this investigation and it’s over quickly. If a male doctor examines you, there will usually be a female nurse present, but if not you can ask for one. You can have someone you feel close to with you during the examination, or if you prefer you can ask whoever is with you to go out until it’s over. You can do whatever makes you feel most comfortable.\nAfter these tests, your GP may arrange for you to see a doctor at the hospital who specialises in problems of the reproductive system (a gynaecologist).\nThe specialist will carry out an internal examination to check if there’s anything unusual in the shape and position of your ovaries and womb. Your GP may have already done an internal examination.&nbsp;\nThe specialist will arrange for you to have some more tests. Different tests are used to diagnose germ cell tumours of the ovary.\nBlood tests&nbsp;check for chemicals in the blood called tumour markers. Some germ cell tumours produce high levels of these.\nUltrasound scans&nbsp;use sound waves to build up a picture of your ovaries and the area around them on a computer screen. The person doing the scan will rub some gel on your tummy and gently move a small device over your tummy to produce the picture. You may also have an ultrasound scan done through the vagina (transvaginal ultrasound), to get a clearer picture. A small probe about the size of a tampon is gently put inside your vagina. It’s not painful but it can be a bit uncomfortable. You can have someone with you during the test if you want to.\nCT scans&nbsp;take a series of X-rays, which build up a 3D picture of the area of the body being scanned. It can show up the size and position of a tumour.\nLaparoscopy is a test that’s sometimes done to look inside your tummy at your ovaries. It’s done under a general anaesthetic. You can usually go home the same day. The surgeon makes 3 to 4 small cuts in the skin in your lower tummy (just above the bikini line). Then they put a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end (called a laparoscope) through one of the cuts to look at the ovaries. Sometimes the surgeon will remove the ovary at the same time as the laparoscopy but they will discuss this with you before you have the surgery. The removed&nbsp;ovary&nbsp;will be looked at under a microscope to find out exactly what type of tumour it is.&nbsp;\nHaving tests and waiting for the results can be an anxious time. Talking about how you feel and getting support from family, friends, your specialist nurse or your doctor can help.\nWe&#8217;ve got more information for young people about:\n- germ cell tumours of the ovary –&nbsp;causes and symptoms\n- treatment of ovarian cancer&nbsp;\n- living with and after ovarian cancer\nIf you&#8217;re looking for information about ovarian cancer in women of all ages, read our&nbsp;ovarian cancer&nbsp;section.\nMost girls and young women can be cured of germ cell tumours of the ovary.\nYour treatment will depend on the type of germ cell tumour you have and whether it has spread outside the ovaries. Treatment is usually a combination of surgery and chemotherapy, although you may only need surgery.\nBefore you have treatment, your specialist needs to know the type of germ cell tumour you have and what stage it is. The stage of a cancer describes the size of the tumour and whether it has spread outside the ovary to any other parts of your body.\nYour specialist will tell you the exact stage of the cancer after the operation to remove your ovary. Most germ cell tumours are diagnosed early when they’re in one or sometimes both ovaries but haven’t spread anywhere else in the body. Waiting to hear about the stage of the cancer can be worrying. But this information is important because it helps your doctors plan the right treatment.\nAnother important part of ovarian cancer treatment is to try to make sure it doesn’t make you infertile (unable to get pregnant). Your doctors will think very carefully about this when planning your treatment.\nYou may have an operation to remove the affected ovary and the fallopian tube. If it’s a very early germ cell tumour this might be the only treatment you need. After your operation you’ll come back to the clinic for regular checks. If there are any signs of the cancer coming back, it’s treated straight away.\nHaving the affected ovary and fallopian tube removed won’t stop you from having a baby in the future. You can still get pregnant with only&nbsp;1 ovary.\nBefore surgery you’ll have a general anaesthetic. During the operation, the surgeon will make a cut in the lower tummy. The ovary is removed through this cut. The operation is called a laparotomy.\nIf the cancer has spread, the surgeon may still do an operation to try to remove as much of the tumour as they can. If possible they will try to leave the other ovary and the womb. You will have more treatment after your operation to treat any of the tumour that they could not remove.\nRemoving both ovaries and the womb is only done if there’s no other way of successfully treating the cancer. Unfortunately this means you will not be able to get pregnant in the future. This can be very upsetting news. You may not have thought about having children yet, so it may be difficult to take in. If this happens there will be lots of support to help you.\nChemotherapy&nbsp;is given after your operation to:\n- get rid of any cancer cells that weren’t removed with surgery\n- stop the cancer from coming back\nYour specialist will explain more about this to you. Germ cell tumours are very sensitive to chemotherapy and this treatment cures most girls. If it’s a very early germ cell tumour you might not even need chemotherapy.\nGerm cell tumours are often treated with the drugs bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin. When these are given together it’s called BEP for short.\nChemotherapy is given in cycles of treatment that usually take 3 weeks. You’ll have 3 to 4 cycles. You’ll spend the first 3 to 5 days of each cycle having your chemotherapy. You’ll usually stay in hospital for those days. You’ll come back to the clinic for another injection of chemotherapy a week later, and then again the following week.\nDifferent chemotherapy drugs cause different side effects. Some girls just have a few side effects, and others have more.\nMost side effects are temporary and gradually disappear once treatment stops. The most common side effects are:\n- hair loss\n- tiredness\n- feeling sick or being sick (this can often be controlled with medicine)\n- being more at risk of getting an infection\nDoctors can’t be certain whether you’ll be able to get pregnant (fertility) in the future after you’ve had chemotherapy. They may talk to you about storing your eggs before chemotherapy starts. Stored eggs can be used with fertility treatments when you’re ready to try to get pregnant.\nYou&#8217;ll usually have chemotherapy after your surgery. You might have more surgery after you’ve finished chemotherapy if there’s still some tumour left behind.\nRadiotherapy&nbsp;treats cancer by using high-energy X-rays to destroy cancer cells. Some types of germ cell tumour are sensitive to radiotherapy, but it is rarely used.\nWe&nbsp;have&nbsp;more information about:\n- germ cell tumours of the ovary – causes and symptoms\n- having tests for ovarian cancer\nIf you&#8217;re looking for information about ovarian cancer in women of all ages, read our general&nbsp;ovarian cancer&nbsp;information."

        "disease": "Overactive thyroid",
        "description": "Overactive thyroid (also known as hyperthyroidism) is a relatively common hormonal condition that occurs when there is too much thyroid hormone in the body.\nExcess levels of thyroid hormones can then speed up the body’s metabolism, triggering a range of symptoms, such as:\n- nervousness and anxiety\n- hyperactivity – where a person can’t stay still and is full of nervous energy\n- unexplained or unplanned weight loss&nbsp;\n- swelling of the thyroid gland, which causes a noticeable lump, known as a goitre, to form in the throat\nThe severity, frequency and range of symptoms can vary from person to person.\nRead more about the symptoms of an overactive thyroid gland\nThe thyroid gland is found in the neck. It produces hormones that are released into the bloodstream to control the body&#8217;s growth and metabolism. These hormones are called thyroxine and triiodothyronine.\nThey affect processes such as heart rate and body temperature, and help convert food into energy to keep the body going.\nIn hyperthyroidism, the thyroid gland produces too much thyroxine or triiodothyronine, which speeds up the body&#8217;s metabolism.\nThere are several possible underlying causes, the most common being Graves&#8217; disease, in which the body&#8217;s immune system targets the thyroid gland and causes it to produce too much of the thyroid hormones.\nRead more about the causes of an overactive thyroid gland\nAn overactive thyroid&nbsp;usually responds well to treatment, and most people are able to control their symptoms.\nThe 3 most widely used treatments for an overactive thyroid gland are:\n- thionamides – a group of medications, including&nbsp;carbimazole and methimazole,&nbsp;that stop the thyroid gland producing too much thyroid hormone\n- radioiodine treatment –&nbsp;a radioactive substance called iodine that helps shrink the thyroid gland, reducing its activity (the radiation contained in iodine is a very low dose and does not pose a threat to health)\n- surgery –&nbsp;in a small number of cases surgery may be required to remove some or all of the&nbsp;thyroid gland, particularly if there is a large goitre\nBeta-blockers may also&nbsp;sometimes be used&nbsp;to temporarily relieve many symptoms of an overactive thyroid gland, although it doesn&#8217;t target the thyroid gland itself.\nIt&#8217;s common for treatment to lead to the thyroid not producing enough hormones. This is known as having an&nbsp;underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism).&nbsp;However, an&nbsp;underactive thyroid is not&nbsp;usually serious and&nbsp;is easily treated.\nRead more about the treatment of an overactive thyroid gland\nAround 1 in 20 people with Graves&#8217; disease will also develop symptoms affecting their eyes, such as:\n- double vision\n- sensitivity to light (photophobia)\n- tearing (excess production of tears)\nThis is known as Graves&#8217; ophthalmopathy and should be seen by a doctor who specialises in treating eye conditions (an ophthalmologist).\nA rarer and more serious complication is a&nbsp;sudden and severe flare-up of symptoms, known as a thyroid storm. A thyroid storm&nbsp;can be&nbsp;life-threatening, as it causes severe&nbsp;dehydration&nbsp;and heart problems.\nRead more about the complications of an overactive thyroid gland\nWomen are 10 times more likely to have an overactive thyroid gland than men.\nIn most cases, symptoms will begin somewhere between the ages of 20 and 40, though they can start at any age, including in childhood.\nAn overactive thyroid gland occurs most frequently in white and Asian people, and less frequently in&nbsp;African-Caribbean&nbsp;people.\nAn overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) has many signs and symptoms, although it is unlikely you would develop all of them.\nIf you have hyperthyroidism, you may experience some of the following symptoms:\n- hyperactivity\n- mood swings – such as anxiety, irritability and nervousness\n- difficulty sleeping (insomnia)\n- feeling tired all the time (fatigue)\n- muscle weakness\n- needing to poo or pee more frequently\n- excess fats in your poo – which can make them greasy and difficult to flush down the toilet (steatorrhoea)\n- sensitivity to heat and&nbsp;excess sweating\n- unexplained or unexpected weight loss – despite having an increased appetite (though in a small number of cases, the increase in appetite can lead to weight gain)\n- very infrequent or light periods, or periods stopping altogether\n- infertility\n- loss of interest in sex&nbsp;\nIf you have diabetes, your diabetic symptoms, such as extreme thirst and tiredness, may be made worse by hyperthyroidism.\nIf you have hyperthyroidism, you may have some of the following physical signs:\n- a swelling in your neck caused by an enlarged thyroid gland (goitre)\n- irregular and/or&nbsp;unusually fast heart rate (palpitations)\n- trembling or shaking (tremor)\n- warm, moist skin\n- redness on the palms of your hands\n- loosening of your nails in their nail beds\n- hives (urticaria)\n- patchy hair loss (alopecia)\n- twitching in your face and limbs\nSee your GP if you are experiencing any of these symptoms. They may not be the result of an overactive thyroid gland, but they will need further investigation.\nIt might be useful to make a list of your symptoms, as this can often be helpful in determining the correct diagnosis.\nOveractive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) occurs when your thyroid gland produces too much of the thyroid hormones thyroxine or triiodothyronine.\nOverproduction of thyroid hormones can be caused by a number of conditions.\nGraves&#8217; disease is the most common cause of overactive thyroid. It can run in families and can occur at any age, although it is most common in women aged 20 to 40 years old. You are more likely to develop Graves&#8217; disease if you smoke.\nGraves&#8217; disease is an autoimmune condition.&nbsp;This means the immune system mistakes&nbsp;something&nbsp;in the body for a toxic substance and attacks it.\nIn&nbsp;Graves&#8217; disease,&nbsp;it attacks the&nbsp;thyroid gland, which&nbsp;leads to an overproduction of the thyroid hormones.\nIt is not known what triggers the immune system to do this. Like many autoimmune conditions, it is thought that a combination of both genetic and environmental factors could be involved.\nIf you have Graves&#8217; disease, your eyes may also be affected, causing discomfort and double vision. This is known as Graves&#8217; ophthalmopathy. You may find&nbsp;your eyes bulge out or appear more prominent.\nFor more information on Graves&#8217; ophthalmopathy, read complications of an overactive thyroid gland.\nIt is possible for lumps to develop in your thyroid gland. These are known as nodules. It is not known why nodules develop, but they are usually non-cancerous (benign).\nHowever, the nodules can contain abnormal thyroid tissue, which affects the normal production of thyroxine or triiodothyronine, causing an overactive thyroid. Nodules that contain abnormal thyroid tissue are described as toxic.\nToxic thyroid nodules account for about&nbsp;1 in 20 cases of hyperthyroidism.\nIodine contained in the food you eat is used by your thyroid gland to produce the thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine. However, taking additional iodine in supplements can cause your thyroid gland to produce too much thyroxine or triiodothyronine.\nThis is known as iodine-induced hyperthyroidism – sometimes referred to as Jod-Basedow phenomenon. It usually only occurs if you already have nodules in your thyroid gland.\nAmiodarone is a type of medication known as an anti-arrhythmic, which helps to control an irregular heartbeat (atrial fibrillation). If you have non-toxic nodules in your thyroid gland, taking amiodarone can cause hyperthyroidism because it contains iodine.&nbsp;\nAmiodarone can cause a type of hyperthyroidism usually more severe and difficult to treat through a harmful effect on thyroid tissue. This type of hyperthyroidism is called amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism.\nIn rare cases, you may develop an overactive thyroid as a result of&nbsp;thyroid cancer that starts in your thyroid follicles. This can occur if cancer cells in your thyroid gland begin to produce thyroxine or triiodothyronine. This is also known as functioning thyroid cancer.\nSee your GP if you think you may have an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism).\nA diagnosis will be based on your symptoms and the results of&nbsp;blood tests that assess how well your thyroid gland is working. These are known as thyroid function tests.\nYour GP will take a sample of your blood and test it for levels of:\n- thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)\n- thyroxine and triiodothyronine (the thyroid hormones)\nTSH is made in the pituitary gland in your brain and controls the production of thyroxine and triiodothyronine.\nWhen the level of thyroxine and triiodothyronine in your blood are normal, your pituitary gland releases a normal level of TSH. When thyroid hormone production becomes excessive, the pituitary gland stops releasing TSH.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nWhen the level of thyroxine or triiodothyronine drops, the pituitary gland produces more TSH to boost it.\nIf you have an overactive thyroid, the thyroid function test will show that levels of TSH in your blood are consistently lower than normal. Low levels of TSH mean your thyroid gland is overactive and&nbsp;likely to be making&nbsp;excessive thyroid hormones. This is the first part of the thyroid function test.\nYour GP will then test your blood for levels of thyroxine and triiodothyronine. If you have an overactive thyroid, you will have higher than normal levels of both these hormones.\nIn some cases, tests may show you have&nbsp;normal thyroid hormone levels, but low or suppressed levels of TSH.\nThis is known a subclinical overactive thyroid gland. If you are diagnosed with subclinical overactive thyroid, you may not need treatment.\nIn most cases, the reduced level of TSH in your blood returns to normal within a couple of months and your subclinical hyperthyroidism will resolve by itself.\nHowever, you will need a further thyroid function test so your condition can be monitored.\nIf tests confirm an overactive thyroid gland, you may be referred for further tests to determine the underlying cause.\nAn additional test that may be used is an isotope thyroid scan. This involves swallowing small amounts of a radioactive substance (an isotope), usually technetium, in capsule or liquid form.\nA scan is then used to measure how much of the isotope has been absorbed by your thyroid gland.\nIf your thyroid gland absorbs a high amount of the isotope, it is likely&nbsp;the underlying cause is either Graves&#8217; disease or thyroid nodules.\nIf the amount is low, the underlying cause could be due to:\n- swelling (inflammation) of the thyroid gland (thyroiditis), often caused by your immune system mistakenly attacking thyroid tissue or, less commonly, by infection\n- having too much iodine in your diet\n- in rare cases,&nbsp;thyroid cancer\nIf you are diagnosed with an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism), your GP will refer you to a specialist in hormonal conditions (endocrinologist) to plan your treatment.\nThionamides, such as carbimazole and propylthiouracil, are a common treatment. They are a type of medication that stops your thyroid gland producing excess amounts of thyroxine or triiodothyronine.\nAs thionamides affect the production of thyroid hormone rather than their current levels, you will need to take them for several weeks before you notice an improvement (usually between 4 to 8 weeks).\nOnce the production of thyroid hormones is under control, your specialist may gradually reduce your medication.\nYou may need to continue taking thionamides for a long time, until the condition is under control.\nAround 1 in 20 people will experience side effects when they first start taking thionamides, such as:\n- itchy skin rash\n- joint pain\nThese side effects should pass once your body is used to the effects of the medication.\nIn rare cases (around 1 in 500), thionamides cause a sudden drop in white blood cells (agranulocytosis), which can make you extremely vulnerable to infection.&nbsp;\nSymptoms of agranulocytosis include:\n- fever\n- gum pain, swelling and bleeding&nbsp;\n- sore throat&nbsp;\n- mouth ulcers&nbsp;\n- persistent&nbsp;cough\n- shortness of breath\nIf you are taking thionamides and you experience any of the symptoms above, phone your GP immediately for advice and an urgent blood test. If this is not possible, phone 111 or your local out-of-hours service.\nBeta-blockers,&nbsp;such as propranolol or atenolol, can relieve some of the symptoms of an overactive thyroid, including tremor (shaking and trembling), rapid heartbeat and hyperactivity.\nYour specialist may prescribe you a beta-blocker while the condition is being diagnosed, or until&nbsp;thionamide brings your thyroid gland under control. However, beta-blockers are not suitable if you have asthma.\nBeta-blockers can sometimes cause side effects, including:\n- feeling sick\n- feeling tired all the time (fatigue)\n- cold hands and feet\n- trouble sleeping, sometimes with nightmares\nRadioiodine treatment is a form of radiotherapy used to treat most types of overactive thyroid. Radioactive iodine shrinks your thyroid gland, reducing the amount of thyroid hormone it can produce.\nRadioiodine treatment&nbsp;is&nbsp;given either as a drink or a capsule to swallow. The dose of radioactivity in the radioiodine is very low and is not harmful.\nRadioiodine treatment is not suitable if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, and may not be suitable if you have eye problems, such as double vision or prominent (bulging) eyes.\nWomen should avoid getting pregnant for at least 6 months after having radioiodine treatment. Men should not father a child for at least 4 months after having radioiodine treatment.\nMost people only require a single dose of radioiodine treatment. If a further follow-up dose is required, it is usually given 6 to 12 months after the first dosage.\nA short course of thionamides treatment may be given a few weeks before radioiodine treatment, as this can lead to a more rapid relief of symptoms.\nIn some cases, a particular treatment may be recommended based on factors such as your age, symptoms and the amount of extra thyroid hormone in your blood. However, there may be circumstances when you are offered a choice between a long-term course of thionamides or radioiodine treatment.\nBoth treatments have advantages and disadvantages.\nAdvantages of thionamides include:\n- they are straightforward to take and you do not have to go to hospital to take them\n- there is less risk of getting an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) as a result of treatment\nDisadvantages of thionamides include:\n- treatment&nbsp;may not be as successful as radioiodine treatment\n- there is a higher risk of side effects\nAdvantages of radioiodine treatment include:\n- treatment is usually very successful\nDisadvantages of radioiodine treatment include:\n- there is&nbsp;a higher chance of your thyroid gland becoming underactive as a result of treatment\n- radioiodine treatment is usually not suitable for people with additional symptoms affecting their eyes (Graves&#8217; ophthalmopathy)\n- women have to avoid getting pregnant for at least 6 months, and men should not father a child for at least 4 months after treatment\nYou should discuss the potential risks and benefits of both types of treatment with the specialist in charge of your care.\nSurgery to remove all or part of the thyroid gland is known as a total or partial thyroidectomy. It is a permanent cure for recurrent overactive thyroid.\nYour specialist may recommend surgery if your thyroid gland is severely swollen (a large goitre) and is causing problems in your neck.\nOther reasons for surgery include:\n- a person cannot be treated with radioiodine treatment as they are pregnant and are unable or unwilling to take&nbsp;thionamides\n- a person has a severe form of Graves&#8217; ophthalmopathy\n- the symptoms return (relapse) after a previous successful course of treatment with thionamides\nIt is normally recommended that the entire thyroid gland is removed, as this means&nbsp;there will be no chance of a relapse.\nHowever, you will need to take medication for the rest of your life to compensate for the lack of a functioning thyroid gland – these will be the same medications used to treat an underactive thyroid gland.\nSeveral complications can occur with an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism), particularly if the condition is not treated.\nIf you have Graves&#8217; disease, you may have problems with your eyes. This is known as Graves&#8217; ophthalmopathy&nbsp;and is thought to be caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the tissues of the eyes. It&nbsp;affects around&nbsp;1 in 20 people with Graves’ disease.\nSymptoms of Graves&#8217; ophthalmopathy include:\n- eyes feeling dry and gritty\n- sensitivity to light (photophobia)\n- excessive tearing\n- double vision\n- some loss of vision\n- a feeling of pressure behind the eyes\nIn more severe cases, your eyes can bulge prominently from your eye sockets.\nIf you do develop Graves&#8217; ophthalmopathy, you will probably be referred to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) for treatment.\nTreatment options include:\n- eyedrops to ease the symptoms\n- sunglasses to protect the eyes against bright lights\n- corticosteroids&nbsp;to reduce inflammation\n- radiotherapy\n- surgery\nSome women are pregnant when they are first diagnosed with an overactive thyroid gland. Becoming pregnant can lead to a relapse of symptoms, especially in someone with a history of Graves’ disease.\nPregnant women with an overactive thyroid are&nbsp;at an increased&nbsp;risk of developing complications during pregnancy and birth, such as&nbsp;miscarriage and&nbsp;eclampsia.\nThey are also more at risk of going into labour prematurely and having a baby with a low birthweight.\nPregnant women will need specialist treatment, so the condition should be managed using medications&nbsp;that don&#8217;t affect the baby. This is likely to be a medication called propylthiouracil.\nIn many cases, treatment causes the thyroid gland to release&nbsp;levels of hormones that are too low. This is known as having an&nbsp;underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism).\nSometimes this will only be a temporary side effect of treatment, but it can often be permanent.\nSymptoms of an underactive thyroid gland include:\n- being sensitive to cold\n- weight gain\n- constipation&nbsp;\n- depression&nbsp;\n- tiredness\nAn underactive thyroid gland is treated using medications to help replicate the effects of the thyroid hormones.\nRead more about the treating an underactive thyroid gland\nAn undiagnosed or poorly controlled overactive thyroid can lead to a rare but serious reaction called a thyroid storm. It&nbsp;affects around 1 in 100 people with an overactive thyroid gland.\nA thyroid storm is a severe and sudden flare-up of symptoms caused by the metabolism going into overdrive, often due to triggers such as:\n- infection\n- pregnancy\n- not taking your medication as directed\n- damage to the thyroid gland, such as a punch to the throat\nSymptoms of a thyroid storm include:\n- a very rapid heartbeat (over 140 beats a minute)\n- fever (a temperature higher than 38C/100.4F)\n- dehydration, with&nbsp;diarrhoea and&nbsp;vomiting\n- jaundice – a yellow tinge to your skin and eyes\n- severe agitation and confusion\n- hallucinations&nbsp;– seeing or hearing things that are not real\n- psychosis&nbsp;– being unable to tell the difference between reality and your imagination\n- excessive sweating\n- chest pain\n- muscle weakness\nA thyroid storm is a medical emergency. If you think you or someone in your care is experiencing this complication, you need to phone 999 for an ambulance."

        "disease": "Paget’s disease of the nipple",
        "description": "Paget’s disease of the nipple, also known as Paget’s disease of the breast, is a rare type of breast cancer.\nThe term Paget’s disease of the nipple is used to distinguish the condition from&nbsp;Paget’s disease of the bone, which&nbsp;occurs when the normal cycle of bone growth is disrupted, leading to the bones becoming weak and deformed.\nA similar type of&nbsp;skin cancer can also occur in other parts of the body.\nThe rest of this section will use the term Paget’s disease to refer to Paget’s disease of the nipple or breast.\nPaget&#8217;s disease usually affects the skin of one nipple and&nbsp;produces eczema-like symptoms, appearing as an itchy, red rash on the nipple that can extend to the darker area of surrounding skin (the areola).\nIt can also appear as a small ulcer or dry, red, flaky patches of skin similar to psoriasis.\nOther possible symptoms include:\n- itchiness or a burning sensation – alongside visible changes to the nipple\n- bleeding from the skin of the nipple\nIf you&#8217;re experiencing itchiness, burning or bleeding but the nipple looks normal and isn&#8217;t red, dry or scaly – this is extremely unlikely to be Paget&#8217;s disease but should still be checked by a doctor.\nPaget’s disease is usually a sign of&nbsp;breast cancer in tissue behind the nipple, or breast tissue away from the nipple.\nThe breast cancer can either be:\n- invasive –&nbsp;where cancerous cells invade the surrounding breast tissue\n- non-invasive&nbsp;– where the cancerous cells are contained in one or more areas of the breast and are unable to spread\nIn a small amount of cases, the only evidence of Paget&#8217;s disease is the nipple changes.\nIn about half of all cases of Paget’s disease of the nipple, a lump is found in the breast. The majority of people with a lump will have invasive breast cancer, although this does not necessarily mean it has spread.\nMost people with Paget&#8217;s disease of the nipple who don&#8217;t have a lump will have non-invasive breast cancer.\nYou should visit your GP if you notice any changes in the skin of your nipple or areola (the darker area of skin around the nipple).\nAs Paget’s disease is a form of breast cancer, the sooner it&#8217;s diagnosed, the better the outcome is likely to be.\nSpeak to your GP if you develop a lump in your breast. While most&nbsp;breast lumps are not cancerous, it&#8217;s important&nbsp;you have it checked out.\nRead more about:\n- the symptoms of breast cancer\n- how Paget&#8217;s disease is diagnosed\nPaget’s disease is treated in the same way as breast cancer.&nbsp;\nSurgery is&nbsp;usually the first line of treatment but unlike other forms of breast cancer, it involves removing breast tissue that includes the nipple and areola.\nThis may be followed by a combination of:\n- chemotherapy&nbsp;– where powerful medication is used to destroy cancerous cells\n- radiotherapy&nbsp;– where controlled doses of high-energy radiation are used to destroy cancerous cells\n- biological or hormone therapy – which can be used to treat certain types of cancer&nbsp;\nIf Paget&#8217;s disease is detected and treated in its early stages, there&#8217;s a good chance of recovery. Read more about how Paget&#8217;s disease is treated.\nModifying certain lifestyle factors, such as reducing alcohol intake and regular exercise, may reduce your risk of developing certain types of cancer, including breast cancer. However, these factors remain controversial.\nScreening is also used to help detect breast cancer early. The NHS Breast Screening Programme provides free breast screening every 3 years for all women in the UK who are 47 years of age or over.\nRead more about preventing breast cancer.\nThere are a number of factors that can increase your risk of developing breast cancer. These include:\n- age – your risk of developing breast cancer increases as you get older\n- family history – if you have a number of close relatives with breast cancer, your chances of also developing the condition are increased\n- previously being diagnosed with breast cancer\n- previously having a benign breast lump – certain types of benign lump may slightly increase your risk but this is only seen in a small number of women\n- being overweight – which is especially significant in post-menopausal women\n- alcohol – your risk of developing breast cancer can increase with the amount of alcohol you drink\nIf you have Paget’s disease of the nipple, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).\nThis helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.\nFind out more about the register.\nAs Paget’s disease of the nipple is usually a sign of breast cancer, it&#8217;s very important you speak to your GP if you notice changes to the tissue or skin of your breast.\nIn particular, you should tell your GP if you notice any changes to:\n- the skin of your nipple or areola (the darker area of skin around the&nbsp;nipple)\n- your breasts, particularly&nbsp;lumps in your breast&nbsp;\nPaget’s disease of the nipple can sometimes be confused with&nbsp;eczema, a skin condition that also&nbsp;causes red, itchy and dry skin.\nTherefore, you should visit your GP for a diagnosis rather&nbsp;than assuming you have eczema. Paget’s disease is a form&nbsp;of&nbsp;breast cancer and&nbsp;the sooner it&#8217;s diagnosed, the better the outcome is likely to be.\nYour GP will examine both breasts, even if you only have a problem with&nbsp;one of them. They may also ask you:\n- about your symptoms and how long you have had them\n- whether you have a history of eczema, or have eczema anywhere else on your body\n- whether you have a personal or family history of breast cancer\n- your age and whether you have experienced the menopause (when a woman&#8217;s monthly periods stop)\n- whether you&#8217;re taking any medication, including hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which is used to treat some of the symptoms of the menopause, or the oral contraceptive pill\n- how much&nbsp;alcohol you drink\n- how much you weigh and if you have recently gained weight\nIf your GP thinks you may have breast cancer, they will refer you to a specialist breast clinic for tests.&nbsp;\nWhen you visit a breast clinic you will have tests to find out whether you have breast cancer and, if you have,&nbsp;what type of breast cancer.\nStaff at the clinic may take photographs of your breasts to record their current appearance and to help identify any further changes that may occur.\nTests carried out at the clinic may include the following:\n- an examination of your breast to check for lumps or other abnormalities\n- a&nbsp;mammogram (if you are&nbsp;35 years of age or over)\n- an&nbsp;ultrasound scan – which is the first line of investigation used in younger women\n- a skin biopsy will be carried out if Paget’s disease is suspected\nA mammogram is a simple procedure that uses X-rays to create an image of the inside of your breasts. It can identify early changes in your breast tissue when it may be difficult to feel a lump.\nYounger women often&nbsp;have denser breasts than older women, which can make identifying changes more difficult. Therefore, mammograms are not as effective in women under 35 years of age. If you&#8217;re under 35, your doctor may suggest you have a breast ultrasound instead.\nHowever after a diagnosis of Paget’s disease has been confirmed, mammography will become an important part of pre-surgery assessment.\nDuring&nbsp;a mammogram, the radiographer will position 1 of your breasts on a flat X-ray plate. A second X-ray plate will press down on your breast from above, so that it is temporarily compressed and flattened between the 2 plates.\nAn X-ray will be taken, which will give a clear image of the inside of your breast. The procedure will then be carried out on your other breast.\nHaving a mammogram can be slightly uncomfortable or even painful, but the procedure will only take a few minutes. Your doctor will examine the image produced by a mammogram for indications of cancer.\nIf you are under&nbsp;35 years of age, a breast ultrasound may be recommended. This is because your breast tissue may be too dense for a mammogram. Your doctor may also suggest a breast ultrasound if they need to find out whether a lump in your breast is solid or contains liquid.\nUltrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your breasts. An ultrasound probe or sensor will be placed over your breasts to create an image on a screen. The image will show any lumps or abnormalities&nbsp;present in your breasts.\nA&nbsp;skin biopsy is used to diagnose Paget’s disease. A biopsy is where a small sample of tissue is taken for examination under a microscope and tests to see if it is cancerous.\nThere are a number of other tests that can be used if a diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed and help determine what types of treatment might be used.\nPaget’s disease of the nipple is often associated with other forms of breast cancer.\nIt&#8217;s usually&nbsp;treated in the same way as more common types of breast cancer, either by removing the cancerous section of the breast or sometimes by removing the entire breast – a procedure known as a mastectomy.\nYou can discuss any concerns you have with your oncologist (cancer specialist) who will be able to explain each phase of your treatment.\nIf you&#8217;re diagnosed with Paget’s disease, surgery is often the first form of treatment you will receive. There are 2 main types of surgery. They are:\n- mastectomy – surgery to remove the whole breast, which can be followed by reconstructive surgery to recreate the removed breast\n- breast-conserving surgery – surgery to remove the cancerous lump (tumour) in your breast\nThese types of surgery will also involve removing your nipple and the darker area of skin surrounding it (the areola).\nA mastectomy removes all your breast tissue, including your nipple. You may need to have a mastectomy if:\n- the tumour is large or in the centre of&nbsp;your breast\n- there is more than one area of breast cancer\n- breast-conserving surgery (see below) is not able to provide acceptable results\nIf lymph nodes (small glands) are removed from your armpit during a mastectomy, the scarring may block the filtering action of the lymph nodes, resulting in a condition called lymphoedema. This is a long-term condition, but can be treated with:\n- massage\n- compression sleeves – tightly fitting bandages that push excess fluid out of your arm\nLymphoedema can develop months or sometimes years after surgery. See your breast care nurse or GP if you notice any swelling in your arm or hand on the side of your operation.\nBreast-conserving surgery aims to save as much of your breast as possible while removing the cancer with a rim of healthy tissue.\nIf you have Paget’s disease, your nipple and areola will be removed. You should be offered reconstructive surgery to improve the appearance of your breast after surgery.\nIf you have breast-conserving surgery, the amount of breast tissue removed will depend on:\n- the size of the tumour in relation to the size of your breast\n- whether the tumour is in one place or scattered throughout your breast\nYour surgeon will remove an area of healthy breast tissue around the cancer so it can be tested for traces of cancer.\nIf cancer cells are found in the surrounding tissue, you may need to have more tissue surgically removed from your breast.\nAfter having breast-conserving surgery, it&#8217;s likely you will need radiation treatment (radiotherapy) to destroy any remaining cancer cells.\nIf you have a mastectomy, you may be able to have reconstructive surgery to recreate your breast. This can be done by:\n- inserting a breast implant\n- using tissue from another part of your body to create a new breast\nThe reconstruction can be carried out at the time of your mastectomy or at a later stage. You should discuss your options fully with your surgeon and breast nurse before making a decision.\nFor example, it may be possible to have reconstructive surgery after breast-conserving surgery to improve the appearance of your breast and create a nipple.\nA nipple can be created by:\n- having a nipple tattooed onto the skin\n- using your own body tissue, such as tissue from your other nipple, although around half of these flatten out and shrink over time\n- using a stick-on latex (rubber) nipple, which can be made from a mould of your other nipple so that&nbsp;they are identical; you stick it on every day with glue and it can be removed for washing\nIf you decide not to have breast reconstruction, you can wear a false breast or breast prosthesis, which are available free on the NHS.\nAfter having a mastectomy, you may have a temporary, fibre-filled prosthesis and a permanent prosthesis made from silicone, which can be replaced every 2 years.\nAfter your surgery, you may need further treatment if you have invasive breast cancer, where the cancerous cells have spread into other tissue in your breast.\nIf you had non-invasive breast cancer, where the breast cancer cells were contained in one area of your breast, surgery may be all the treatment you need.\nOther types of treatment for breast cancer include:\n- chemotherapy – cytotoxic medication that prevents cancer cells from dividing and growing is used to destroy cancer cells\n- radiotherapy&nbsp;– where controlled doses of high-energy radiation, usually X-rays, are used to destroy cancer cells\n- biological therapy – if your breast cancer is HER2 positive, biological therapy, usually a medication called trastuzumab, can be used to treat the cancer by stopping the effects of HER2 and helping your immune system fight off cancer cells\n- hormone therapy – if your breast cancer is hormone-receptor positive, hormone therapy can be used to treat the cancer by lowering the levels of hormones in your body or stopping their effects\nA number of factors can help reduce your risk of developing breast cancer, including Paget&#8217;s disease of the nipple.\nExercising regularly&nbsp;and eating a&nbsp;healthy, balanced&nbsp;diet are known&nbsp;to help prevent&nbsp;many forms of cancer, as well as other serious&nbsp;health conditions, such as&nbsp;heart disease and diabetes.\nStudies have looked at the link between&nbsp;breast cancer&nbsp;and diet and, although there are no definite conclusions at the moment, there are benefits for women who maintain a&nbsp;healthy weight, do regular exercise and who have a low intake of&nbsp;saturated fat and alcohol.\nIt has been suggested that exercising regularly (a minimum of 150 minutes or 2 hours 30 minutes a week)&nbsp;can reduce your risk of developing breast cancer by&nbsp;up to&nbsp;a third.\nIf you have been through the&nbsp;menopause (when your monthly periods stop), it&#8217;s particularly important you are not overweight or obese. This is because these conditions cause more oestrogen to be produced, which can increase the risk of breast cancer.\nStudies have shown that women who breastfeed are statistically less likely to develop breast cancer than those who don&#8217;t.\nThe reasons are not fully understood, but it could be because women don&#8217;t ovulate as regularly while they are breastfeeding and oestrogen levels remain stable.\nIn June 2013, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) announced that two medications, called tamoxifen and raloxifene, would be available on the NHS for women who have an increased risk of developing breast cancer.\nEither tamoxifen or raloxifene can be used in women who have been through the menopause, but only tamoxifen should be used in women who haven&#8217;t.\nThese medications may not be suitable if in the past you have had blood clots&nbsp;or womb cancer, or if you have an increased risk of developing these problems in the future. Women who have already had a mastectomy to remove both breasts won&#8217;t be offered these medications because their risk of developing breast cancer is so small.\nA course of treatment with tamoxifen or raloxifene will usually involve taking a tablet every day for 5 years.\nRaloxifene can cause side effects including flu-like symptoms, hot flushes and leg cramps. Side effects of tamoxifen can include hot flushes and sweats, changes to your periods and nausea and vomiting.\nYour chances of giving birth to a child with birth defects increases while you&#8217;re taking tamoxifen, so you&#8217;ll be advised to stop taking it at least 2 months before trying for a baby. The medication can also increase your risk of blood clots so you should stop taking it 6 weeks before any planned surgery.\nCurrently, these 2 medications are not licensed for the purpose of reducing the risk of breast cancer in women with an increased risk of developing the condition. However, they can still be used if you understand the benefits and risks and your doctor believes the treatment will be helpful.\nBreast screening can pick up breast cancer before it forms a lump. The procedure uses mammograms, where X-rays&nbsp;are taken,&nbsp;to create an image of the inside of your breasts.\nThe&nbsp;NHS Breast Screening Programme provides free breast screening every 3 years for all women in the UK who are 50 years of age or over. The NHS has recently extended the breast screening age range so that all women who are 47&nbsp;to 73 years of age will be eligible for breast screening.\nNHS breast screening is not usually available for women under 47 years of age. This is because younger women tend to have denser breast tissue which makes mammograms less effective at identifying abnormalities.\nSpeak to your GP if you are below screening age, worried about changes in your breasts, or&nbsp;have a family history of breast cancer.\nRead more information about breast screening"

        "disease": "Pancreatic cancer",
        "description": "Pancreatic cancer is caused by the abnormal and uncontrolled growth of cells in the pancreas – a large gland that&#8217;s part of the digestive system.\nAround half of all new cases are diagnosed in people aged 75 or over. It&#8217;s uncommon&nbsp;in people under 40 years of age.\nIn the early stages, a tumour in the pancreas doesn&#8217;t usually cause any symptoms, which&nbsp;can make it difficult to diagnose.\nIt&#8217;s important to remember that these symptoms can be caused by many different conditions, and aren&#8217;t usually the result of cancer.&nbsp;But you should contact your GP if you&#8217;re concerned, or if these symptoms start suddenly.\nThe first noticeable symptoms of pancreatic cancer are often:\n- pain in the back or stomach area&nbsp;–&nbsp;which may come and go at first and is often worse when you lie down or after you&#8217;ve eaten\n- unexpected weight loss\n- jaundice&nbsp;– the most obvious sign is yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes;&nbsp;it also causes your urine to be dark yellow or orange and your stools (faeces) to be pale-coloured\nOther possible symptoms of pancreatic cancer include:\n- nausea and vomiting\n- bowel changes\n- fever and shivering\n- indigestion\n- blood clots\nYou may also develop symptoms of&nbsp;diabetes&nbsp;if you have&nbsp;pancreatic cancer, because it can produce chemicals that interfere with the normal effect of insulin.\nThere are also a&nbsp;number of different endocrine tumours that cause different symptoms, depending on the hormone the tumour produces.\nIt&#8217;s not fully understood what causes pancreatic cancer, but a number of risk factors for developing the condition have been identified.\nRisk factors for pancreatic cancer include:\n- age&nbsp;–&nbsp;it mainly affects people who are 50 to 80 years of age&nbsp;\n- smoking&nbsp;– around 1 in 3 cases&nbsp;is associated with using cigarettes, cigars or chewing tobacco\n- having a history of certain health conditions&nbsp;–&nbsp;such as&nbsp;diabetes,&nbsp;chronic pancreatitis&nbsp;(long-term inflammation of the pancreas),&nbsp;stomach ulcer&nbsp;and Helicobacter pylori infection (a stomach infection)\nIn about 1 in 10 cases, pancreatic cancer is inherited from a person&#8217;s parents. Certain genes also increase your chances of getting pancreatitis, which in turn increases your risk of developing cancer of the pancreas.\nCancer Research UK&nbsp;has more information on&nbsp;risk factors and causes&nbsp;on their website\nYour GP will first ask about your general health and carry out a physical examination. They&nbsp;may examine your tummy (abdomen) for a lump and to see whether your liver is enlarged.\nThey&#8217;ll also check your skin and eyes&nbsp;for signs of&nbsp;jaundice and&nbsp;may request a urine sample and&nbsp;blood test.\nIf your GP suspects pancreatic cancer, you&#8217;ll usually be referred to a specialist at a hospital for further investigation. You may have either:\n- an&nbsp;ultrasound scan\n- a&nbsp;computerised tomography (CT) scan\n- a&nbsp;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan\n- a&nbsp;positron emission tomography (PET) scan&nbsp;– where you&#8217;re given an injection of a very small amount of radioactive medication, known as a tracer, which helps to show up cancers in an image\nDepending on the results of a scan, further tests may include:\n- an&nbsp;endoluminal ultrasonography (EUS)&nbsp;endoscopy&nbsp;– a type of endoscopy&nbsp;which allows&nbsp;close-up ultrasound pictures to be taken of your pancreas&nbsp;\n- an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)&nbsp;– a type of endoscopy&nbsp;which is used to inject a special dye into your bile and pancreatic ducts; the dye will show up on an&nbsp;X-ray&nbsp;and highlight any tumours\n- a&nbsp;laparoscopy&nbsp;– a surgical procedure that allows the surgeon to see inside your body using a laparoscopy&nbsp;(a thin,&nbsp;flexible microscope)\nA&nbsp;biopsy, where a small sample is taken from a suspected tumour, may also be carried out during these procedures.\nIn 2015, the&nbsp;National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)&nbsp;published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer and refer people for the right tests faster.\nTo find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected pancreatic cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on&nbsp;Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral.\nCancer of the pancreas is difficult to treat. It&nbsp;rarely causes any symptoms in the early stages, so it&#8217;s often not detected until the cancer is fairly advanced. If the tumour is&nbsp;large, treating the cancer will be more difficult.\nIf you&#8217;ve been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, your treatment&nbsp;will depend on the type and location of your cancer, and how far it&#8217;s advanced. Your age, general health and personal preferences will also be taken into consideration.\nThe first aim will be to completely remove the tumour and any other cancerous cells. If this isn&#8217;t possible, treatment will focus on preventing the&nbsp;tumour growing and causing further harm to your body.\nThe 3 main treatments for pancreatic cancer are:\n- surgery\n- chemotherapy\n- radiotherapy\nSome types of pancreatic cancer only require one form of treatment, whereas others may require&nbsp;2&nbsp;types of treatment or a combination of all 3.\nRead more about&nbsp;treating pancreatic cancer.\nRecovering from pancreatic cancer surgery can be a long and difficult process.\nYou&#8217;ll probably experience some pain after your operation. The staff at your hospital will make sure you have adequate pain relief.\nAfter any type of surgery to your digestive system, your bowel will temporarily stop working. This means you won&#8217;t be able to eat or drink straight away.\nYou&#8217;ll gradually be able to sip fluids, before eventually being able to drink and eat more regularly. You may&nbsp;be referred to a dietitian, who can advise you about what foods you should eat following your operation.\nAfter the tumour has been removed, you&#8217;ll probably have a six-month course of&nbsp;chemotherapy, which greatly increases your chance of being cured.&nbsp;But because&nbsp;cancer of the pancreas is difficult to diagnose and treat, many people don&#8217;t recover&nbsp;completely.\nTreatment can be very effective in helping to ease symptoms and make you as comfortable as possible. Chemotherapy can help shrink your tumour and slow down its growth.\nTreatment for pancreatic cancer depends on the type, location and stage of your cancer (how far it&#8217;s spread).\nYour age, general health and personal preferences will also be taken into consideration when deciding on your treatment plan.\nThe first aim will be to completely remove the tumour and any other cancerous cells in your body.\nIf this isn&#8217;t possible, the focus will be on preventing the tumour growing and causing further harm.\nSometimes it&#8217;s not&nbsp;possible to get rid of the cancer or slow it down,&nbsp;so treatment will aim to relieve your symptoms and make you as comfortable as possible.\nCancer of the pancreas is very difficult to treat. In its early stages, this type of cancer rarely causes symptoms, so it&#8217;s often not detected until it&#8217;s quite advanced. If the tumour is large or has spread, treating or curing the cancer is much harder.\nDeciding what treatment is best for you can be a difficult process. There&#8217;s a lot to take in, so it&#8217;s important to talk about the possible alternatives with a family member or friend.\nYou should also have an in-depth&nbsp;discussion with your doctor, who can tell you the pros and&nbsp;cons of the treatments available to you.\nIf at any stage you don&#8217;t understand the treatment options being explained to you, make sure you ask your doctor for more details.\nThere are 3 main ways that cancer of the pancreas can be treated:\n- surgery\n- chemotherapy\n- radiotherapy\nSome types of pancreatic cancer only require one form of treatment, whereas others may require 2 or a combination of all 3.\nCancer Research UK has more information about types of treatment for pancreatic cancer.\nSurgery is usually the only way&nbsp;pancreatic cancer can be completely cured. However, as the condition is usually advanced by the time it&#8217;s diagnosed, surgery is only suitable for around 15 to 20% of people.\nHowever, this isn&#8217;t a suitable option&nbsp;if your tumour has wrapped itself around important blood vessels. If your cancer has spread to other areas of the body, surgically removing the tumour won&#8217;t cure you.\nSurgery for pancreatic cancer is usually only an option for people who have a good general level of&nbsp;health. This is because pancreas surgery is often long and complex, and the recovery process can be slow.\nSometimes&nbsp;the risks of surgery&nbsp;can outweigh the potential benefits.\nYour doctor will discuss with you whether surgery is a suitable option.\nThe Whipple procedure is the most common operation used to treat pancreatic cancer, and involves removing the head of the pancreas.\nYour surgeon must also remove the first part of your small intestine (bowel), your gall bladder (which stores&nbsp;bile)&nbsp;and part of your bile duct. Sometimes, part of the stomach also has to be removed.\nThe end of the bile duct and the remaining part of your pancreas is connected to your small intestine. This&nbsp;allows bile and the hormones and enzymes produced by the pancreas to still be released into&nbsp;your system.\nAfter this type of surgery, about one in three people need to take enzymes to help them digest food.\nThe Whipple procedure involves long and intensive surgery, but it&#8217;s easier to recover from than a total pancreatectomy.\nA distal pancreatectomy involves&nbsp;removing the tail and body of your pancreas.\nYour spleen will usually also be removed at the same time. Part of your stomach, bowel, left adrenal gland, left kidney and left diaphragm (the muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdomen) may also be removed.\nLike the Whipple procedure, a distal pancreatectomy is a long and complex operation&nbsp;that won&#8217;t be carried out&nbsp;unless your doctor thinks it&#8217;s necessary.\nDuring a total pancreatectomy, your entire pancreas will be removed. This is sometimes necessary due to the position of the tumour.\nYour surgeon will also remove your:\n- bile duct\n- gall bladder\n- spleen\n- part of your small intestine\n- part of your stomach (sometimes)\n- surrounding lymph nodes (part of the immune system)\nAfter a total pancreatectomy, you&#8217;ll need to take enzymes to help your digestive system digest food. You&#8217;ll also have&nbsp;diabetes&nbsp;for the rest of your life because the pancreas produces insulin&nbsp;–&nbsp;the hormone that regulates blood sugar.\nRemoving your spleen can increase your risk of developing infections and may also affect your blood&#8217;s ability to clot. This means you&#8217;ll be on penicillin (or an alternative antibiotic if you&#8217;re allergic to it) for the rest of your life, and you&#8217;ll need to have regular vaccinations.\nSometimes, you may need to take tablets for a short period to stop the platelets in your blood sticking to each other. Platelets are a type of blood&nbsp;cell&nbsp;that cause your blood to clot (thicken).\nAlthough surgery may not be a suitable way of removing your tumour, you may be offered&nbsp;it to help ease your symptoms.\nThis type of surgery won&#8217;t cure your cancer, but will mean that your condition is easier to manage, and it will make you more comfortable.\nTo help control jaundice, a stent can be placed in your bile duct using endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). This will help keep the bile duct open and prevent bilirubin&nbsp;–&nbsp;the yellow chemical in bile&nbsp;–&nbsp;from building up and causing jaundice.\nIf a stent isn&#8217;t a suitable option for you, you may need an operation to bypass your blocked bile duct. Your surgeon will cut the bile duct just above the blockage and reconnect it to your intestine, which allows your bile to drain away.\nThese types of surgery are much less intensive than surgery carried out on the pancreas. The recovery time is much quicker, and&nbsp;people find that their&nbsp;jaundice improves significantly.\nChemotherapy&nbsp;is a type of cancer treatment that uses anti-cancer medicines to either kill the cancerous (malignant) cells in your body or stop them&nbsp;multiplying.\nChemotherapy treatment is often used alongside surgery and radiotherapy (see below) to help ensure that as much of the cancer is treated as possible.\nChemotherapy may be given:\n- before surgery&nbsp;–&nbsp;to try to shrink the cancer, so there&#8217;s a greater chance of the surgeon being able to remove all of the cancer\n- after surgery&nbsp;–&nbsp;to help reduce the risk of the cancer coming back\n- when surgery isn&#8217;t possible&nbsp;–&nbsp;to try to shrink the cancer, slow its growth and relieve your symptoms\nSome chemotherapy medicines can be taken orally (by mouth), but some need to be given directly into a vein (intravenously).\nChemotherapy also attacks&nbsp;normal, healthy cells, which is why this type of treatment can have many side effects. The most common side effects include:\n- vomiting\n- nausea\n- mouth sores\n- fatigue\n- increased risk of infection&nbsp;\nThese are usually only temporary, and should improve once you&#8217;ve completed your treatment.\nThe chemotherapy medications can also be used in combination, so your doctor may suggest using one medication or a combination of 2 or 3.\nCombining chemotherapy medications can give a better chance of shrinking or controlling the cancer, but increases the chance of side effects.&nbsp;Sometimes, the risks of chemotherapy can outweigh the potential benefits.\nRead more about&nbsp;chemotherapy\nRadiotherapy&nbsp;is a form of cancer therapy that uses high-energy beams of&nbsp;radiation&nbsp;to help shrink your tumour and relieve pain.\nSide effects of radiotherapy&nbsp;can include:\n- fatigue\n- skin rashes\n- loss of appetite\n- diarrhoea\n- nausea or vomiting&nbsp;\nThese side effects are usually only temporary, and should improve after your treatment has been completed.\nRead more about&nbsp;radiotherapy\nIn its early stages, pancreatic cancer rarely causes symptoms.\nThe pancreas is actually 2 glands in one, and symptoms depend on which part is affected. This is because:\n- the exocrine pancreas produces digestive enzymes, which break down food so they can be absorbed by your body\n- the endocrine pancreas produces hormones – including insulin, which keeps your blood sugar levels stable\nMost cases&nbsp;of pancreatic cancer are&nbsp;in the exocrine pancreas, and the 3 most common symptoms are:\n- pain in the stomach or&nbsp;back\n- jaundice\n- weight loss\nIt&#8217;s important to remember that these symptoms can be caused by many different health conditions and aren&#8217;t usually the result of cancer.&nbsp;However, you should contact your GP if you&#8217;re concerned, or if you&nbsp;suddenly develop these symptoms.\nPancreatic cancer can cause a dull pain in your upper tummy (abdomen), which may&nbsp;spread to your back.\nTo begin with, the pain may come and go, but as the tumour becomes larger and more advanced, the pain may be more constant and last longer.\nThe pain is often worse when you lie down or after you&#8217;ve eaten. You may also have pain or tenderness in your abdomen if your liver, pancreas or gallbladder are enlarged.\nMany types of cancer cause weight loss, because the cancerous cells deprive your healthy cells of the nutrients they need.\nPancreatic cancer is more likely to cause weight loss than some other cancers because the pancreas produces digestive enzymes, which help food to be absorbed into your body.\nIf a tumour disrupts that production, your body will find it harder to digest food, particularly high-fat foods.\nThis can cause you to lose weight and become&nbsp;malnourished.\nJaundice is caused by a build-up of a yellowish-brown substance called bilirubin in the blood and tissues of the body.\nThe most obvious sign of jaundice is yellow skin and yellowing of the whites of the eyes. It also causes your urine to be dark yellow or orange and your stools (faeces) to be pale-coloured.\nBilirubin is a waste product produced by the liver, and passed out of the body through the bile duct and&nbsp;into the intestine.\nJaundice is more often a sign of conditions such as&nbsp;gallstones&nbsp;or&nbsp;hepatitis&nbsp;than it is of cancer.\nHowever, a tumour can sometimes develop in the head of the pancreas and block the bile duct, causing bilirubin to build up&nbsp;in the body.\nThe pancreas produces the&nbsp;hormone&nbsp;insulin. Without it, the body can&#8217;t move glucose (sugar) out of the blood and into your cells.\nThe main symptoms of diabetes include:\n- excessive thirst\n- urinating frequently – particularly at night&nbsp;\n- extreme tiredness&nbsp;\n- weight loss and loss of muscle bulk\nYou may develop&nbsp;diabetes&nbsp;if you have&nbsp;pancreatic cancer, because it can produce chemicals that interfere with the normal effect of insulin.\nOther possible symptoms of pancreatic cancer include:\n- itching (if you have jaundice)\n- nausea and vomiting\n- bowel changes\n- fever and shivering\n- indigestion\n- blood clots\nEndocrine pancreatic tumours, also known as neuroendocrine tumours, are uncommon.\nThere are a number of different endocrine tumours that cause different symptoms, depending on the hormone the tumour produces.\nThe exact cause of pancreatic cancer isn&#8217;t fully understood. However, there are a number of risk factors&nbsp;that can increase your chances of developing it.\nPancreatic cancer can affect people of any age, but it&nbsp;mainly affects people who are aged 50 to 80. Almost 50% of people diagnosed with cancer of the pancreas are aged 75 or over.\nResearch has found that about one in three cases of pancreatic cancer is associated with&nbsp;smoking&nbsp;and other tobacco use.\nSmoking cigarettes, cigars or chewing tobacco can all increase your risk of developing cancer of the pancreas.\nThis is because tobacco smoke contains harmful chemicals and toxins that can cause irritation and inflammation&nbsp;within your body&#8217;s organs and&nbsp;tissues.\nIf you have&nbsp;diabetes, your risk of developing pancreatic cancer is thought to be&nbsp;increased.\nHowever, it&#8217;s important to remember that diabetes is very common and most people with diabetes won&#8217;t develop pancreatic cancer.\nAs well as diabetes being a risk factor for pancreatic cancer, it&#8217;s also thought that a cancerous tumour that grows in the pancreas could be responsible for some cases of diabetes.\nChronic&nbsp;pancreatitis&nbsp;(long-term inflammation of the pancreas) increases your risk of getting pancreatic cancer, but&nbsp;isn&#8217;t responsible for many cases. Chronic pancreatitis is often caused by long-term&nbsp;alcohol misuse.&nbsp;\nAlthough it&#8217;s a very&nbsp;rare condition, if you have hereditary pancreatitis, your&nbsp;risk of developing pancreatic cancer is 50 times greater than the rest of the population.\nHelicobacter pylori are bacteria that cause stomach ulcers, and is a known risk factor for stomach cancer.\nResearch has shown that a Helicobacter pylori infection may slightly&nbsp;increase your risk of getting pancreatic cancer. However, the risk is thought to be small because most people with&nbsp;this infection don&#8217;t get cancer of the pancreas.\nThere are also a number of other factors that have been associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. These are:\n- long-term&nbsp;hepatitis\n- tooth or&nbsp;gum disease\n- heavy alcohol use\n- a previous history of certain types of&nbsp;cancer\n- previously having&nbsp;radiotherapy\n- diet,&nbsp;weight&nbsp;and level of&nbsp;physical activity\nThe&nbsp;Cancer Research UK&nbsp;website has&nbsp;more information about these&nbsp;other possible risk factors for pancreatic cancer.\nIn the early stages, pancreatic cancer often causes no symptoms. This can make it difficult to diagnose.\nIf you visit your GP with&nbsp;symptoms of pancreatic cancer,&nbsp;they will probably examine your eyes and skin for signs of jaundice.\nThey may also test your urine for bile, or carry out a&nbsp;blood test. This is because jaundice can sometimes be a sign of pancreatic cancer.\nYour GP may also examine your tummy (abdomen) to feel for any swelling or abnormality. The pancreas is quite well-hidden within the body because it&#8217;s covered by part of the bowel. This can make it difficult to feel for tumours during a physical examination.\nIf&nbsp;your GP suspects pancreatic cancer, you&#8217;ll be referred for further testing at a hospital.&nbsp;\nIn 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected pancreatic cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on&nbsp;Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral.\nAn&nbsp;ultrasound scan&nbsp;is a painless procedure that uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your body.\nIf&nbsp;pancreatic cancer is suspected, you&#8217;ll be referred for an ultrasound scan of your abdomen to see if your pancreas appears abnormal.\nHowever, this type of scan can often miss pancreatic cancer, because ultrasound waves aren&#8217;t very good&nbsp;at penetrating deep into body tissues.&nbsp;\nA&nbsp;computerised tomography (CT)&nbsp;scan&nbsp;produces a detailed image of the inside of your body using a series of&nbsp;X-ray&nbsp;images.\nYour doctor can use the results of a CT&nbsp;scan to check for abnormalities and assess the size of the tumour.\nA&nbsp;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan&nbsp;also produces an image of the inside of your body, but it uses strong magnetic and radio waves instead of X-rays.\nMRI scans are carried out in a tube-shaped&nbsp;MRI scanner. It&#8217;s a noisy procedure that&nbsp;can feel claustrophobic. It also takes longer than other types of&nbsp;scans.\nLike a CT scan, an MRI scan allows your doctor to check for signs of&nbsp;cancer&nbsp;in other parts of the body.\nA positron emission tomography (PET) scan can help to show where the cancer is and whether it has spread to other parts of the body.\nBefore the scan, you&#8217;ll be given an injection of a very small amount of a radioactive medication, known as&nbsp;a tracer. The amount of&nbsp;radiation is very small and no more than you would receive from a normal X-ray.&nbsp;\nThe most common tracer used is a radioactive form of glucose (sugar).&nbsp;You&#8217;ll then rest for about an hour to allow the tracer to travel to areas in your body where glucose is used for energy.\nThe scan itself can take up to an hour and produces an image of the tracer in your body. The tracer shows up cancers because they use glucose in a different way to normal tissue.\nIf a small shadow is seen on a CT or MRI scan but it&#8217;s not obvious what it&nbsp;is, another test called endoluminal ultrasonography (EUS) can be carried out.\nDuring EUS, a thin, flexible&nbsp;instrument called&nbsp;an endoscope is passed through your mouth and guided towards your stomach.\nAn ultrasound probe attached to the tip of the endoscope will then be used to take close-up pictures of your pancreas.\nBefore the procedure, you may be given a sedative to help you relax. EUS can also be used to take a&nbsp;biopsy&nbsp;for further examination.\nEndoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a procedure used to insert a plastic tube or stent into the bile duct if&nbsp;someone has&nbsp;jaundice.\nDuring ERCP, an endoscope is passed through your mouth and guided towards your stomach. The endoscope can then be used to inject a special dye into your bile and pancreatic ducts.\nAfter the dye has been injected, an X-ray will be taken. The dye will show up on the X-ray and will highlight any tumour that&#8217;s blocking the bile and pancreatic ducts.\nDuring the procedure, tissue samples may be taken. These samples can be looked at under a microscope to see whether the cells are cancerous.\nERCP can take 30 to 60 minutes. As with EUS, you&#8217;ll usually be given a sedative to help you relax.\nA&nbsp;laparoscopy is a surgical procedure that allows the surgeon to access the inside of your abdomen and pelvis.\nDuring the procedure, a small&nbsp;incision will be made in your abdomen, and a laparoscope (a thin,&nbsp;flexible microscope) will be inserted.\nThis will allow the surgeon to see inside your body and make sure the tumour hasn&#8217;t spread before recommending its removal.\nThis procedure will be carried out&nbsp;under a&nbsp;general anaesthetic&nbsp;(where you&#8217;re put to sleep so you don&#8217;t feel any pain or discomfort).\nA&nbsp;biopsy&nbsp;involves taking a sample from a suspected tumour, which&nbsp;can then be tested to see if it&#8217;s cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign).\nA biopsy can be carried out during an EUS, ERCP or laparoscopy using&nbsp;a small instrument attached to the endoscope to collect a number of cells.\nIt&#8217;s also possible for a&nbsp;biopsy to be carried out using a long, thin needle that&#8217;s passed through your abdomen. The needle will be guided towards the tumour using an ultrasound or CT scan.\nRecovering from pancreatic cancer surgery can be a long and difficult process.\nYou&#8217;ll probably experience some pain after your operation. The staff at your hospital will make sure you have adequate pain relief.\nAfter any type of surgery to your digestive system, your bowel will temporarily stop working. This means you won&#8217;t be able to eat or drink straight away.\nYou&#8217;ll gradually be able to sip fluids, before eventually being able to drink and eat more regularly. You may&nbsp;be referred to a dietitian, who can advise you about what foods you should eat following your operation.\nAfter the tumour has been removed, you will probably have a 6-month course of&nbsp;chemotherapy, which greatly increases your chance of being cured. However, as cancer of the pancreas is difficult to diagnose and treat, many people don&#8217;t recover&nbsp;completely.\nTreatment can be very effective in helping to ease symptoms and make you as comfortable as possible. Chemotherapy can help shrink your tumour and slow down its growth."

It&#8217;s a natural response to stressful or&nbsp;dangerous situations.\nHowever, for someone with panic disorder, feelings of anxiety, stress and panic occur regularly and at any time.\nAnxiety is a feeling of unease. It can range from mild to severe and can include feelings of worry and fear. There are several conditions that can cause severe anxiety including\n- phobias&nbsp;– an extreme or irrational fear of an object, place, situation, feeling or animal\n- generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) – a long-term condition that causes excessive anxiety and worry relating to a variety of situations\n- post-traumatic stress disorder – a condition with psychological and physical symptoms caused by distressing or frightening events\nA panic attack occurs when your body experiences a rush of intense psychological (mental) and physical symptoms.\nYou may experience an overwhelming sense of fear, apprehension and anxiety. As well as these feelings, you may also have physical symptoms such as:\n- nausea\n- sweating\n- trembling\n- a sensation that your heart is beating irregularly (palpitations)\nThe number of panic attacks you have will depend on how severe your condition is. Some people may have one or two attacks each month, while others may have several attacks a week.\nRead more about the symptoms of panic disorder.\nPanic attacks can be very frightening and intense, but they&#8217;re not dangerous. An attack won&#8217;t cause you any physical harm, and it&#8217;s unlikely that you&#8217;ll be admitted to hospital if you&#8217;ve had a panic attack.\nAs with many mental health conditions, the exact cause of panic disorder isn&#8217;t fully understood.\nHowever, it&#8217;s thought the condition is probably linked to a combination of physical and psychological factors.\nRead about the possible causes of panic disorder.\nIt’s important to be aware that some physical conditions and disorders can have similar symptoms to those of anxiety. For example:\n- mitral valve prolapse\n- postural orthostatic tachycardic syndrome (POTS)\n- anaemia\n- paroxysmal atrial tachycardia – episodes of rapid and regular heartbeats that begin and end abruptly\n- thyrotoxicosis – where large amounts of thyroid hormones are released into the bloodstream, causing rapid heartbeat, sweating, tremor and anxiety\n- poorly controlled diabetes\n- adrenal tumours – growths that develop on the adrenal glands (two triangular-shaped glands that form part of the kidneys)\n- carcinoid syndrome – a set of symptoms caused by some carcinoid tumours that can develop in the cells of the endocrine system (glands that produce and secrete hormones)\n- Zollinger-Ellison syndrome – causes overproduction of insulin and low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)\nSee your GP if you have symptoms of anxiety or panic disorder (see above).\nYou may be diagnosed with panic disorder if you experience recurrent and unexpected panic attacks followed by at least one month of continuous worry or concern about having further attacks.\nRead more about how panic disorder is diagnosed.\nThe aim of treating panic disorder is to reduce the number of panic attacks you have and ease the severity of your symptoms.\nPsychological therapy and medication are the two main types of treatment for panic disorder.\nRead more about treating panic disorder and things you can do to help yourself during a panic attack.\nHaving panic disorder may affect your ability to drive. It&#8217;s your legal obligation to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) about a medical condition that could have an impact on your driving ability.\nGOV.UK has further information and advice about driving with a disability or health condition.\nPanic disorder is treatable, but to make a full recovery it&#8217;s important that you seek medical help as soon as possible. Treatment for panic disorder is much more effective if it&#8217;s given at an early stage.\nLeft untreated, panic disorder can become a very debilitating and isolating illness. It can also increase your risk of developing other mental health conditions, such as agoraphobia or other phobias.\nAgoraphobia is a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult, or help wouldn&#8217;t be available if things go wrong.\nRead more about the complications of panic disorder.\nThe symptoms of a panic attack can be very frightening and distressing.\nSymptoms tend to occur suddenly, without warning and often for no apparent reason.\nAs well as overwhelming feelings of anxiety, a panic attack can also cause a variety of other&nbsp;symptoms, including:\n- a sensation that your heart is beating irregularly (palpitations)\n- sweating\n- trembling\n- hot flushes\n- chills\n- shortness of breath&nbsp;\n- a choking sensation\n- chest pain\n- nausea\n- dizziness\n- feeling&nbsp;faint\n- numbness or&nbsp;pins and needles\n- dry mouth\n- a need to go to the toilet\n- ringing in your ears&nbsp;\n- a feeling of dread or a fear of dying\n- a churning stomach\n- a tingling sensation in your fingers\n- shivering\n- shaking\nThe physical symptoms of a panic attack are unpleasant, and they can also be accompanied by thoughts of fear and terror.\nFor this reason, people with panic disorder start to fear the next attack, which&nbsp;creates a&nbsp;cycle of living in ‘fear of fear’ and adds to the sense of panic.\nSometimes, the symptoms of a panic attack can be so intense they can make you feel like you&#8217;re having a heart attack.\nHowever, it&#8217;s important to be aware that symptoms such as a racing heartbeat and shortness of breath won&#8217;t result in you having a heart attack. Although panic attacks can often be frightening, they don&#8217;t cause any physical harm. People who have had panic disorder for some time usually learn to recognise this &#8216;heart attack sensation&#8217; and&nbsp;become more aware of how to control their symptoms.\nMost panic attacks last for five to 20 minutes.&nbsp;Some attacks have been reported to have lasted up to an hour. However, it&#8217;s likely that in these cases one attack occurred straight after another or high levels of anxiety were felt after the first attack.\nPeople with panic disorder have panic attacks on a recurring basis. Some people have attacks once or twice a month, while others have them several times a week.\nPeople with panic disorder also tend to have ongoing and constant feelings of worry and anxiety. The panic attacks associated with panic disorder can be very unpredictable.\nIf you have panic disorder, you may also&nbsp;feel&nbsp;anxious about when your next attack will be.\nDuring a panic attack your symptoms can be so intense and out of your control that you can&nbsp;feel detached from the situation, your body and your surroundings. It can almost feel as if you&#8217;re an observer, making the situation seem very unreal.\nThis sense of detachment is known as depersonalisation. Being detached from the situation doesn&#8217;t provide any relief or make a panic attack less frightening. Instead, it often makes the experience more confusing and disorientating.\nAs with many mental health conditions, the exact cause of panic disorder isn&#8217;t fully understood.\nIt&#8217;s thought that panic disorder is probably caused by a combination of physical and psychological factors. Some of these factors are outlined below.\nA trauma, such as bereavement, can sometimes trigger feelings of panic and anxiety. These feelings may be obvious soon after the event or they may be triggered unexpectedly years later.\nHaving a close family member with panic disorder is thought to increase a person&#8217;s risk of developing it. However, the precise nature of the risk isn&#8217;t known.\nNeurotransmitters are chemicals that occur naturally in the brain. It&#8217;s thought that an imbalance of these chemicals may increase your risk of developing conditions such as panic disorder.\nSome experts believe that panic disorder is linked to an increased sensitivity to carbon dioxide. Breathing in air with high carbon dioxide levels can bring on panic attacks, and breathing techniques can help to relieve or stop panic attacks.\nAnother theory is that people who experience panic attacks tend to focus on&nbsp;minor physical symptoms and interpret them in a catastrophic way. This triggers a nervous system response that causes the panic attack.\nEveryone who has panic disorder will experience panic attacks.\nHowever, not everyone who has&nbsp;panic attacks is diagnosed with panic disorder.\nSome people have panic attacks in response to specific situations. For example, they may have a phobia (overwhelming fear) of enclosed spaces (claustrophobia) and have a panic attack when faced with an enclosed space.\nWhile most people with&nbsp;phobias only experience panic attacks when faced with the thing that&nbsp;triggers their fear, the panic attacks of people with panic disorder usually occur without warning and for no obvious reason.\nThis means that panic disorder will only be diagnosed after experiencing recurrent and unexpected panic attacks, and if the attacks are followed by at least one month of continuous worry or concern about having further attacks.\nYour GP will ask you to describe the symptoms you&#8217;ve been experiencing. They&#8217;ll also ask you how often your symptoms occur and in what situations.\nIt&#8217;s important to tell your GP about how you&#8217;ve been feeling and how your symptoms have affected you.\nAlthough it can sometimes be difficult to talk to someone else about your feelings, emotions and personal life,&nbsp;try not to feel anxious or embarrassed.\nYour GP needs to gain a good understanding of your symptoms to&nbsp;make the correct diagnosis and recommend the most appropriate treatment for you.\nYour GP may also want to carry out a physical examination to look for signs of any physical conditions that could be causing your symptoms.\nFor example, an&nbsp;overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) can sometimes cause similar symptoms to a panic attack.\nBy ruling out any underlying medical conditions, your GP will be able to make the correct diagnosis.\nThe main aim in treating panic disorder is to reduce the number of panic attacks and ease the severity of symptoms.\nPsychological therapy and medication are the two main types of treatment for panic disorder.\nDepending on your individual circumstances, you may need one of these treatment types or a combination of the two.\nIf you&#8217;re offered psychological therapy, it will probably be in the form of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). If this doesn&#8217;t work, medication may be recommended.\nBefore starting any form of treatment, your GP will discuss all of the options with you, outlining the advantages of each type and making you aware of any possible risks or side effects.\nNo single treatment works for everyone and you may need to try a number of treatments before finding one that works for you. The treatment that&#8217;s recommended will depend on your general level of health, the severity of your condition and your personal preferences.\nIt&#8217;s important you understand what your treatment will involve. If you don&#8217;t understand something your GP has told you, ask them to explain it in more detail.\nPsychological therapy has proven long-term benefits and it&#8217;s recommended for treating panic disorder. It will usually take the form of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).\nCBT is thought to be one of the most effective psychological treatments for panic disorder. It involves having regular sessions with a therapist.\nThe therapist may discuss with you how you react when you have a panic attack and what you think about when you&#8217;re experiencing an attack.\nOnce you and your therapist have identified any negative thoughts and beliefs, you can work on replacing them with more realistic and balanced ones. Your therapist can also teach you ways of changing your behaviour, making it easier for you to deal with future panic attacks.\nFor example, they may be able to show you breathing techniques that can be used to help keep you calm during a panic attack.\nThe&nbsp;National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends a total of seven to 14 hours of CBT to be completed within a four month period. Treatment will usually involve having a weekly one to two hour session.\nNICE also recommends that in certain situations a shorter programme of CBT may be appropriate. This can involve a reduced number of hours of CBT with ‘homework’ being set between sessions so that you can practice what you&#8217;ve learnt after each session.\nYou should visit your GP regularly&nbsp;while you&#8217;re having CBT so that they can assess your progress and see how you&#8217;re doing.\nSupport groups can provide useful information and advice about how you can effectively manage your panic disorder. They&#8217;re also a good way of meeting other people who&#8217;ve had similar experiences of the condition.\nPanic attacks can sometimes be frightening and isolating, so it can be helpful to know that other people are experiencing the same feelings and emotions as you.\nAnxiety UK and Triumph Over Phobia (TOP UK) are UK-based charities that provide information and support for people with anxiety disorders.\nSupport groups often involve face-to-face meetings where you can talk about your problems and difficulties with others. Many can also provide support and guidance over the telephone or in writing.\nAsk your GP about support groups for panic disorder near you. You can also use the services directory to&nbsp;find anxiety services in your area.\nAntidepressants&nbsp;are often associated with depression, but they can also be used to treat a number of other psychological conditions.\nAntidepressants can take two to four weeks before becoming effective. It&#8217;s therefore important to continue taking them, even if you feel they&#8217;re&nbsp;not working. You should only ever stop taking prescribed medication if your GP specifically advises you to do so.\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants are two types of antidepressants that are often recommended for treating&nbsp;panic disorder.\nWhen starting a new type of medication, you should be regularly assessed by your GP at two, four, six and 12 week intervals. This will allow you to discuss any issues that you have with your medication, and enables your GP to assess which treatment is most effective. It will also provide you with the opportunity to try a different type of medication if you want to.\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors&nbsp;(SSRIs) are a type of antidepressant that work by increasing the level of a chemical called serotonin in your brain.\nThey&#8217;re the most commonly prescribed type of antidepressant for treating panic disorder. They&#8217;re usually started at a low dose before gradually being increased as your body adjusts to the medicine.\nCommon side effects of SSRIs include:\n- nausea\n- headaches&nbsp;\n- low sex drive&nbsp;(loss of libido)\n- blurred vision\n- diarrhoea&nbsp;or&nbsp;constipation\n- dizziness\n- dry mouth&nbsp;\n- loss of appetite\n- sweating\n- feeling agitated\n- insomnia&nbsp;(sleep problems)\n- abdominal pain\nWhen you first start taking SSRIs, your feelings of&nbsp;anxiety and panic may get slightly worse. In most cases, this is temporary and your symptoms will start to return to normal levels within a few days of taking the medicine.\nSpeak to your GP if you feel that your symptoms have got worse and that they&#8217;re not showing signs of returning to normal levels after a few days.\nAfter you start to take a SSRI, you should visit your GP after two, four, six, and 12 weeks so that they can check on your progress and see whether you&#8217;re responding to the medicine. Not everyone responds well to antidepressant medicines, so it&#8217;s important that your progress is carefully monitored.\nIf your GP feels it necessary, you may require regular&nbsp;blood tests or blood pressure checks when taking antidepressants. If after 12 weeks of taking the medication you don&#8217;t show any signs of improvement, your GP may prescribe an alternative SSRI to see if it has any effect.\nThe length of time that you&#8217;ll have to take a SSRI for will vary depending on how well you respond to the treatment. Even if you feel that your panic disorder has been successfully treated, it&#8217;s likely that you&#8217;ll need to keep taking the medication for at least six to 12 months.\nIf you stop taking your medication before this time, the risk of your symptoms recurring may be increased. Some people may have to take SSRIs for longer than the usual six to 12 month period.\nWhen you and your GP decide that it&#8217;s appropriate for you to stop taking SSRIs, you will gradually be weaned off them by slowly reducing your dosage. As with antidepressants, you should never stop taking SSRIs&nbsp;unless your GP specifically advises you to.\nStopping your medication straight away without being weaned off, or without seeking advice from your GP, may result in withdrawal symptoms such as:\n- dizziness\n- numbness and tingling\n- nausea and vomiting\n- headache\n- anxiety\n- sleep disturbances\n- sweating\nThese symptoms can also occur if you miss a dose of medication, or if your dose is reduced. The symptoms are usually mild, but they can be severe if the medication is stopped suddenly.\nFor some people, this means having to take SSRIs on a long-term basis. For others, a course of CBT can help to reduce the risk of their symptoms recurring.\nContact your GP if you experience troublesome side effects that&nbsp;don&#8217;t ease.\nIf SSRIs aren&#8217;t suitable, or if your symptoms don&#8217;t improve after a 12 week course of SSRIs, your GP may try prescribing a different type of antidepressant.\nTricyclic antidepressants work in a similar way to SSRIs. They regulate the levels of the chemicals noradrenaline and serotonin in your brain, which has a positive effect on your feelings and mood.\nImipramine&nbsp;and&nbsp;clomipramine are two tricyclic antidepressants that are often prescribed to treat panic disorder. Tricyclic antidepressants aren&#8217;t addictive.\nSSRIs are usually prescribed before tricyclic antidepressants because they have fewer side effects. Common side effects of tricyclic antidepressants include:\n- constipation\n- difficulty urinating\n- blurred vision\n- dry mouth\n- weight gain or weight loss\n- drowsiness\n- sweating\n- lightheadedness\n- skin rash\nThe side effects should ease after seven to 10&nbsp;days as your body starts to get used to the medication. However, see your GP if they become troublesome and don&#8217;t ease.\nPregabalin is another medication that’s often used to treat panic disorder. It’s an anticonvulsant that&#8217;s also used to treat&nbsp;epilepsy (a condition that causes repeated seizures). However, it&#8217;s also been found to be beneficial in treating anxiety.\nSide effects of pregabalin can include:\n- drowsiness\n- dizziness\n- increased appetite and weight gain\n- blurred vision\n- headaches\n- dry mouth\n- vertigo – the sensation that you, or the environment around you, are moving or spinning\nPregabalin is less likely to cause nausea or a low sex drive than SSRIs.\nClonazepam is another medication that’s often used to treat epilepsy and is also sometimes prescribed for panic disorder.\nIt can cause a wide variety of side effects including lethargy (lack of energy), abnormal eye movement (nystagmus), confusion and allergic reactions.\nYou may be referred to a mental health specialist if treatments such as attending a support group, CBT and medication don&#8217;t improve your symptoms of panic disorder.\nA mental health specialist will carry out an overall reassessment of your condition. They&#8217;ll ask you about your previous treatment and how effective you found it. They may also ask you about things in your life that may be affecting your condition, or how much support you get from family and friends.\nThe specialist will be able to devise a treatment plan for you, which will aim to effectively treat your symptoms. The type of mental health specialist that you&#8217;ll be referred to will depend on your individual situation. For example, you may be referred to a:\n- psychiatrist – a trained medical doctor who specialises in mental health; a psychiatrist is one of the only mental health specialists who is able to prescribe medication\n- clinical psychologist – who is trained in the scientific study of human behaviour and mental processes and focuses solely on the assessment and treatment of mental health conditions; a clinical psychologist will help you to find ways of effectively managing your anxiety and panic attacks\nThere are several self-help techniques you can use to help treat the symptoms of panic disorder yourself.\nSome of these techniques are listed below.\nIf possible, you should stay where you are during a panic attack. The attack could last up to an hour, so you may need to pull over and park where it&#8217;s safe to do so if you&#8217;re driving.\nIf you have a panic attack, remind yourself that the frightening thoughts and sensations will eventually pass.\nDuring an attack, try to focus on something that&#8217;s non-threatening and visible, such as the time passing on your watch or items in a supermarket.\nWhile you&#8217;re having a panic attack, try to focus on your breathing. Feelings of panic and&nbsp;anxiety can get worse if you breathe too quickly. Try breathing slowly and deeply while counting to three on each breath in and out.\nWhen you have a panic attack, try to identify what it is you fear and challenge it. You can achieve this by constantly reminding yourself that what you fear isn&#8217;t real and that it will pass in a few minutes.&nbsp;\nMany things can go through your mind during a panic attack – for example, some people think about disaster or death. Instead of focusing on negative thoughts, try to concentrate on positive images.\nThink of a place or a situation that makes you feel peaceful, relaxed or at ease. Once you have this image in your mind, try to focus your attention on it. It should help distract you from the situation and may also help ease your symptoms.\nThinking positively can be difficult, particularly if you&#8217;ve got used to thinking negatively over a long period of time. Creative visualisation is a technique that requires practice, but you may gradually notice positive changes in the way you think about yourself and others.\nFighting a panic attack can often make it worse. Trying to resist the attack and finding you&#8217;re unable to can increase your sense of anxiety and panic.\nInstead, during a panic attack, reassure yourself by accepting that although it may seem embarrassing, and your symptoms may be difficult to deal with, the attack isn&#8217;t life-threatening. Focus on the fact that the attack will evetually end and try your best to let it pass.\nIf you have panic disorder, you may feel constantly stressed and anxious, particularly about when your next panic attack may be. Learning to relax can help to relieve some of this tension, and it may also help you to deal more effectively with your panic attacks when they occur.\nSome people find complementary therapies, such as massage and aromatherapy, help them to relax. Activities, such as yoga and pilates, can also be helpful. You can also practise breathing and relaxation techniques, which you can use during a panic attack to help ease your symptoms.\nRegular exercise, particularly aerobic exercise, will help reduce stress and release tension. It can also encourage your brain to release the chemical serotonin, which can help improve your mood.\nIt&#8217;s&nbsp;recommended that adults aged 19-64 years should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, such as cycling or fast&nbsp;walking, every week.\nThey should also do muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days a week that work all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms).\nVisit your GP for a fitness assessment before starting a new exercise programme if you haven&#8217;t exercised before or for a long time.\nRead more about the physical activity guidelines for adults.\nUnstable blood sugar levels can contribute to the symptoms of a panic attack. Therefore, you should maintain a healthy, balanced diet, eat regularly and avoid eating sugary food and drinks. Also, avoid caffeine, alcohol and smoking because they can all contribute to panic attacks.\nPanic disorder is a treatable condition, but to make a full recovery it&#8217;s very important you seek medical help as soon as possible.\nThis is because treatment for panic disorder is much more effective if it&#8217;s given at an early stage.\nLeft undiagnosed and untreated, panic disorder can become a debilitating and isolating illness. It can also increase your risk of developing other psychological conditions.\nAgoraphobia&nbsp;is a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult, or help wouldn&#8217;t be available if things go wrong.\nIf you have agoraphobia, leaving home, going out in public and travelling alone can cause intense anxiety. Many people with agoraphobia avoid everyday activities because of their phobia.\nAgoraphobia is&nbsp;one of the&nbsp;conditions that can develop alongside panic disorder. People with panic disorder can develop agoraphobia because of their fear of having a panic attack in a public place.\nYou may worry that a panic attack in a public place will be embarrassing, or that you&#8217;ll have difficulty getting help if you need it. You may also worry about public places that you would have difficulty leaving, such as a train, if you were to have a panic&nbsp;attack.\nIf you have agoraphobia, you may find it difficult to leave the house, particularly if you&#8217;re not with a trusted family member or a friend.\nIf you have panic disorder, you may also develop other fears and&nbsp;phobias, which can often seem irrational. For example, you may start to worry about a particular object or action that triggers your attacks and become fearful of those things.\nPanic disorder is more common in teenagers than in younger children.\nPanic attacks can be particularly debilitating for children and young people. Severe panic disorder may affect their development and learning. The fear of having a panic attack may stop children from going to school and engaging in a social life. They may also find it difficult to concentrate on their schoolwork.\nDiagnosing panic disorder&nbsp;in children is usually a case of taking a detailed medical history and carrying out a thorough physical examination&nbsp;to rule out any physical causes for the symptoms.\nScreening for other anxiety disorders may also be needed to help determine what&#8217;s causing your child’s panic attacks.\nPanic attacks in children are often dramatic events, including screaming and crying and an increased breathing rate (hyperventilation).\nIf your child displays the signs and symptoms of panic disorder over a prolonged period of time, your GP may refer them to a specialist for further assessment and treatment.\nThe specialist may recommend a course of psychotherapy&nbsp;for your child, such as&nbsp;cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).\nSome studies have shown that conditions that cause intense anxiety, such as panic disorder, can also increase your risk of developing an alcohol or drug problem.\nThe side effects or withdrawal symptoms of both prescribed medication and&nbsp;illegal drugs can increase the symptoms of anxiety.\nSmoking and caffeine can also make your anxiety symptoms worse, so you should try to&nbsp;give up smoking (if you smoke) and limit the amount of caffeine in your diet."

This&nbsp;leads to a reduction&nbsp;in a chemical called dopamine in the brain.\nDopamine plays a vital role in regulating the movement of the body. A reduction in dopamine is responsible for many of the symptoms of Parkinson&#8217;s disease.\nExactly what causes the loss of nerve cells is unclear. Most experts think that a combination of genetic and environmental factors is responsible.\nRead more about the causes of Parkinson&#8217;s disease\nIt&#8217;s thought around 1 in 500 people are affected by Parkinson&#8217;s disease, which means&nbsp;there are an estimated 127,000 people in the UK with the condition.\nMost people with Parkinson&#8217;s start to develop symptoms when they&#8217;re over 50, although around 1 in 20 people with the condition first experience symptoms&nbsp;when they&#8217;re under 40.\nMen are slightly more likely to get Parkinson&#8217;s disease than women.\nAlthough there&#8217;s currently no cure for Parkinson&#8217;s disease, treatments are available to help reduce the main symptoms and maintain quality of life for as long as possible.\nThese include:\n- supportive treatments&nbsp;– such as physiotherapy&nbsp;and occupational therapy\n- medication\n- in some cases, brain&nbsp;surgery\nYou may not need any treatment during the early stages of Parkinson&#8217;s disease, as symptoms are usually mild.

Some of the more common symptoms are described below.\nHowever,&nbsp;the order in which these develop and their severity is different for each individual.&nbsp;It&#8217;s unlikely that&nbsp;a person&nbsp;with Parkinson&#8217;s disease would experience all or&nbsp;most of these.\nThe three main symptoms of Parkinson&#8217;s disease affect physical movement:\n- tremor&nbsp;– shaking, which usually begins in the hand or arm and is more likely to occur when the limb is relaxed and&nbsp;resting\n- slowness of movement (bradykinesia) – where physical movements are much slower than normal, which can make everyday tasks difficult and can result in a distinctive slow, shuffling walk with very small steps\n- muscle stiffness (rigidity) – stiffness and tension in the muscles, which can make it difficult to move around and make facial expressions, and can result in painful muscle cramps (dystonia)\nThese main&nbsp;symptoms are sometimes referred to by doctors as parkinsonism as there can be causes other than Parkinson&#8217;s disease.\nParkinson&#8217;s disease can also cause a range of other physical and mental symptoms.\n- balance problems – these can make someone with the condition more likely to have a fall and injure themselves\n- loss of sense of smell (anosmia)&nbsp;– sometimes occurs several years before other symptoms develop\n- nerve pain –&nbsp;can cause unpleasant sensations, such as burning, coldness or numbness\n- problems with urination – such as having to get up frequently during the night to urinate or&nbsp;unintentionally passing urine (urinary incontinence)\n- constipation\n- an inability to obtain or sustain an erection (erectile dysfunction)&nbsp;in men&nbsp;\n- difficulty becoming sexually aroused and achieving an orgasm&nbsp;(sexual dysfunction) in women\n- dizziness, blurred vision or fainting&nbsp;when moving from a sitting or lying position to a standing one&nbsp;–&nbsp;caused by a sudden drop in blood pressure\n- excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis)\n- swallowing difficulties (dysphagia)&nbsp;–&nbsp;this can lead to malnutrition and dehydration\n- excessive production of saliva (drooling)\n- problems sleeping (insomnia)&nbsp;– this can result in excessive sleepiness during the day\n- depression and anxiety\n- mild cognitive impairment – slight memory problems and problems with activities that require planning and organisation\n- dementia – a group of symptoms, including more severe memory problems, personality changes,&nbsp;seeing things that aren&#8217;t there (visual hallucinations) and&nbsp;believing things that aren&#8217;t true (delusions)\nSee your GP if you&#8217;re concerned you may have symptoms of Parkinson&#8217;s disease.\nYour GP will ask about your symptoms and your medical history to help them decide whether it&#8217;s necessary to refer you to a specialist for further tests.\nRead more about diagnosing Parkinson&#8217;s disease\nParkinson&#8217;s disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells in the part of the brain called the substantia nigra.\nNerve cells in this part of the brain are responsible for producing a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine acts as a messenger between the parts of the brain and nervous system that help control and co-ordinate body movements.\nIf these nerve cells die or become damaged, the amount of dopamine in the brain is reduced. This means the part of the brain controlling movement can&#8217;t work as well as normal, causing movements to become slow and abnormal.\nThe loss of nerve cells is a slow process.&nbsp;The symptoms of Parkinson&#8217;s disease&nbsp;usually only start to develop when around 80% of the nerve cells in the substantia nigra have been lost.\nIt&#8217;s not known why the loss of nerve cells associated with Parkinson&#8217;s disease occurs, although research is ongoing to identify potential causes.\nCurrently, it&#8217;s believed a combination of genetic changes and environmental factors may be responsible for the condition.\nA number of genetic&nbsp;factors have been shown to&nbsp;increase a person&#8217;s risk of developing Parkinson&#8217;s disease, although exactly how these make some people more susceptible to the condition is unclear.\nParkinson&#8217;s disease can run in families as a result of faulty genes being passed to&nbsp;a child by their parents. However, it&#8217;s rare for the disease to be inherited this way.\nSome researchers also feel environmental factors may increase a person&#8217;s risk of developing Parkinson&#8217;s disease.\nIt&#8217;s been suggested that pesticides and herbicides used in farming&nbsp;and traffic or industrial pollution may contribute to the condition.\nHowever, the evidence linking environmental factors to Parkinson&#8217;s disease is inconclusive.\n&#8220;Parkinsonism&#8221; is the umbrella term used to describe the symptoms of tremors, muscle rigidity and slowness of movement.\nParkinson&#8217;s disease is the most common type of parkinsonism, but there are also some rarer types where a specific cause can be identified.\nThese include parkinsonism caused by:\n- medication (drug-induced parkinsonism) – where symptoms develop after taking certain medications, such as some types of antipsychotic medication, and usually improve once the medication is stopped\n- other progressive brain conditions – such as progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple systems atrophy, and&nbsp;corticobasal degeneration\n- cerebrovascular disease – where a series of small strokes cause several parts of the brain to die\nYou can read more about parkinsonism on the Parkinson&#8217;s UK website.\nNo tests can conclusively show that you have Parkinson&#8217;s disease. Your doctor will base a diagnosis on your symptoms, medical history and a detailed physical examination.\nYour GP will&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;you&nbsp;about the problems you&#8217;re experiencing and may&nbsp;ask you to perform some simple mental or physical tasks, such as moving or walking around,&nbsp;to help with the diagnosis.\nIn the early stages, your GP may find it difficult to say whether you definitely have the condition because symptoms are usually mild.\nIf your GP suspects Parkinson&#8217;s disease, you&#8217;ll be referred to a specialist. This will usually be:\n- a neurologist – a specialist in conditions affecting the brain and nervous system\n- a geriatrician – a specialist in problems affecting elderly people\nIf your GP thinks you may be in the early stages of Parkinson&#8217;s disease, you should see a specialist within six weeks. If they think you may be in the later stages, you should see a specialist within two weeks.\nThe specialist will most likely ask you to perform a number of physical exercises so they can assess whether you have any problems with movement.\nA diagnosis of Parkinson&#8217;s disease is likely if you have at least two of the three following symptoms:\n- shaking or tremor in a part of your body that usually only occurs at rest\n- slowness of movement (bradykinesia)\n- muscle stiffness (rigidity)\nIf your symptoms improve after taking a medication called levodopa, it&#8217;s more likely you have Parkinson&#8217;s disease.\nSpecial brain scans, such as a&nbsp;single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan, may also be carried out in some cases&nbsp;to try to&nbsp;rule out&nbsp;other causes of&nbsp;your symptoms.\nBeing told you have Parkinson&#8217;s disease can be emotionally distressing, and the news can often be difficult to take in.\nThis means it&#8217;s important that you have the support of your family and a care team who will be able to help you come to terms with the diagnosis.\nYou may find it useful to contact&nbsp;Parkinson&#8217;s UK,&nbsp;the Parkinson&#8217;s support and research charity.\nThey can be contacted by:\n- free helpline on 0808 800 0303 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 7pm, and 10am to 2pm on&nbsp;Saturdays)\n- email: hello@parkinsons.org.uk\nParkinson&#8217;s UK&nbsp;brings people with Parkinson&#8217;s, their carers and families together through&nbsp;a network of local groups, as well as online resources and a confidential helpline.\nParkinson&#8217;s UK provides information and support on every aspect of living with Parkinson&#8217;s.\nThere are several therapies that can make living with Parkinson&#8217;s disease easier and help you deal with your symptoms on a day-to-day basis.\nThere are efforts underway to try to increase the availability of these supportive therapies for Parkinson&#8217;s patients on the NHS.\nYour local authority may be able to advise and help you. Ask your local authority for a care and support needs assessment.\nA physiotherapist can work with you to relieve muscle stiffness and joint pain through movement (manipulation) and exercise.\nThe physiotherapist aims to make moving easier, and improve your walking and flexibility. They also try to improve your fitness levels and ability to manage things for yourself.\nAn occupational therapist can identify areas of difficulty in your everyday life&nbsp;–&nbsp;for example, dressing yourself or getting to the local shops.\nThey can help you work out practical solutions, and ensure your home is safe and properly set up for you. This will help you maintain your independence for as long as possible.\nRead more about occupational therapy\nMany people with Parkinson&#8217;s disease have swallowing difficulties (dysphagia)&nbsp;and problems&nbsp;with their speech.\nA speech and language therapist can often help&nbsp;you improve these problems by teaching speaking and swallowing exercises, or by providing assistive technology.\nFor some people with Parkinson&#8217;s disease, making dietary changes can help improve some symptoms.\nThese changes&nbsp;can include:\n- increasing the amount of fibre in your diet and making sure you&#8217;re drinking enough fluid to reduce&nbsp;constipation\n- increasing the amount of salt in your diet and eating small, frequent meals to avoid problems with&nbsp;low blood pressure, such as&nbsp;dizziness when you stand up quickly\n- making changes to your diet to avoid&nbsp;unintentional weight loss\nYou may see a dietitian, a healthcare professional trained to give diet advice, if your care team thinks you&nbsp;may benefit from changing your diet.\nMedication&nbsp;can be used to&nbsp;improve the main symptoms of Parkinson&#8217;s disease, such as shaking (tremors) and movement problems.\nHowever, not all the medications available are useful for everyone, and the short- and long-term effects of each are different.\nThree main types of medication are commonly used:\n- levodopa\n- dopamine agonists\n- monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors\nYour specialist can explain your medication options, including the risks associated with each medication, and discuss which may be best for you. Regular reviews will be required as the condition progresses and your needs change.\nRead on to learn about the treatments you may be offered. You can also see a summary of the pros and cons of treatments for Parkinson&#8217;s disease, where you can compare your options.\nMost people with Parkinson&#8217;s disease eventually need a medication called levodopa.\nLevodopa is absorbed by the nerve cells in your brain and turned into the chemical dopamine, which is used to transmit messages between the parts of the brain and nerves that control movement.\nIncreasing the levels of dopamine using levodopa usually improves movement problems.\nIt&nbsp;is usually taken as a tablet or liquid, and is often combined with other medication, such as benserazide or carbidopa.\nThese medications stop the levodopa being broken down in the bloodstream before it has a chance to get to the brain.\nThey also reduce the side effects of levodopa, which include:\n- feeling sick (nausea) or vomiting\n- tiredness\n- dizziness\nIf you&#8217;re prescribed levodopa, the initial dose&nbsp;is usually very small and will be gradually increased until it takes effect.\nAt first, levodopa can cause a dramatic improvement in the symptoms.\nHowever, its effects can be less long-lasting over the following years&nbsp;–&nbsp;as more nerve cells in the brain are lost, there are fewer of them to absorb the medicine. This means the dose may need to be increased from time to time.\nLong-term use of levodopa is also linked to problems such as uncontrollable, jerky muscle movements (dyskinesias) and &#8220;on-off&#8221; effects, where the person rapidly switches between being able to move (on) and being immobile (off).\nDopamine agonists act as a substitute for dopamine in the brain and have a similar but milder effect compared&nbsp;with levodopa. They can often be given less frequently than levodopa.\nThey&nbsp;are often taken as a tablet, but are also available as a skin patch (rotigotine).\nSometimes dopamine agonists are taken at the same time as levodopa, as this allows lower doses of levodopa to be used.\nPossible side effects of dopamine agonists include:\n- nausea or vomiting\n- tiredness and sleepiness\n- dizziness\nDopamine agonists can also cause hallucinations and&nbsp;increased confusion, so they need to be used with caution, particularly in elderly patients, who are more susceptible.\nFor some people, dopamine agonists have been linked to the development of compulsive behaviours,&nbsp;especially at high doses, including addictive gambling and an excessively increased libido.\nTalk to your healthcare specialist if you think you may be experiencing these problems.\nAs the person themselves may not realise the problem, it&#8217;s key that carers and family members also note any abnormal behaviour and discuss it with an appropriate professional at the earliest opportunity.\nIf you&#8217;re prescribed a course of dopamine agonists, the initial dose is usually very small to prevent nausea and other side effects.\nThe dosage is gradually increased over a few weeks. If nausea becomes a problem, your GP may prescribe anti-sickness medication.\nA potentially serious, but uncommon, complication of dopamine agonist therapy is sudden onset of sleep.\nThis generally happens as the dose is being increased and tends to settle once the dose is stable.\nPeople are&nbsp;usually advised to&nbsp;avoid driving while the dose is being increased in case this complication occurs.\nMonoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitors, including selegiline and rasagiline, are another alternative to levodopa for treating early Parkinson&#8217;s disease.&nbsp;\nThey block the effects of an enzyme or&nbsp;brain substance that breaks down&nbsp;dopamine (monoamine oxidase-B), increasing dopamine levels.\nBoth selegiline and rasagiline can improve the symptoms of Parkinson&#8217;s disease, although their effects are small compared with levodopa. They can be used alongside levodopa or dopamine agonists.\nMAO-B inhibitors are generally very well tolerated, but can occasionally&nbsp;cause side effects, including:\n- nausea\n- headache\n- abdominal pain\n- high blood pressure\nCatechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors are prescribed for people in later stages of Parkinson&#8217;s disease. They prevent levodopa from being broken down by the enzyme COMT.\nSide effects of COMT inhibitors include:\n- nausea or vomiting\n- diarrhoea\n- abdominal pain\nWhen Parkinson&#8217;s symptoms become difficult to control with tablets alone, a number of other treatments can be considered.\nA dopamine agonist called apomorphine can be injected under the skin (subcutaneously) either&nbsp;by:\n- a single injection, when required\n- a continuous infusion&nbsp;using a small pump carried around on your belt, under your clothing, or in a bag\nIf you have severe on-off fluctuations, a type of levodopa called duodopa may be used.\nThis medication comes as a gel that&#8217;s continuously pumped into your gut through a tube inserted through your abdominal wall.\nThere&#8217;s an external pump attached to the end of the tube, which you carry around with you.\nAbout 25 specialist neuroscience centres in the UK offer this treatment.&nbsp;This treatment is only available if you have very severe on-off fluctuations or involuntary movements.\nMost people with Parkinson&#8217;s disease are treated with medication, although a type of surgery called deep brain stimulation is&nbsp;used in some cases.\nThis surgery is also available in specialist neuroscience centres around the UK, but it&#8217;s not suitable for everyone.\nIf&nbsp;surgery is&nbsp;being considered, your specialist will discuss the possible risks and benefits with you.\nDeep brain stimulation involves surgically implanting a pulse generator similar to a heart pacemaker into your chest wall.\nThis is connected to one or two fine wires placed under the skin, and is&nbsp;inserted precisely into specific areas in your brain.\nA tiny electric current is produced&nbsp;by the pulse generator, which runs through the wire and stimulates the part of your brain affected by Parkinson&#8217;s disease.\nAlthough surgery doesn&#8217;t cure Parkinson&#8217;s disease, it can ease the symptoms for some people.\nAs well as&nbsp;the main symptoms of movement problems, people with Parkinson&#8217;s disease can experience a wide range of additional symptoms that may need to be treated separately.\nThese include:\n- depression and anxiety – this can be treated with self care measures such as exercise, psychological therapy or medication; read more about&nbsp;treating depression\n- problems sleeping (insomnia) – this can be improved by making changes to your normal bedtime routine; read more about treating insomnia\n- erectile dysfunction – this can be treated with medication; read more about treating erectile dysfunction\n- excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis) – this can be reduced using a prescription antiperspirant,&nbsp;or surgery in severe cases; read more about treating hyperhidrosis\n- swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) –&nbsp;this can be improved by eating softened food, or by using a feeding tube in more severe cases; read more about treating dysphagia\n- excessive drooling – this can be improved with swallowing exercises, or surgery or medication in severe cases\n- urinary incontinence – this can be treated with exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles, medication, or surgery in severe cases; read more about treating urinary incontinence\n- dementia –&nbsp;this can be treated with cognitive therapies and medication in some cases; read more about treating dementia\nMuch progress has been made in the treatment of Parkinson&#8217;s disease&nbsp;as the result of&nbsp;clinical trials,&nbsp;where new treatments and treatment combinations are compared with standard ones.\nAll clinical trials in the UK are carefully overseen to ensure they are worthwhile and safely conducted. Participants in clinical trials sometimes do better overall than those in routine care.\nIf you are asked if you want to take part in a trial, you will be given an information sheet about the trial.\nIf you want to take part, you will be asked to sign a consent form. You can refuse to take part or withdraw from a clinical trial without it affecting your care.\nSome people with Parkinson&#8217;s disease find&nbsp;complementary therapies help them feel better. Many complementary treatments and therapies claim to ease the symptoms of Parkinson&#8217;s disease.\nHowever, there&#8217;s no clinical evidence they&#8217;re effective in controlling the symptoms of Parkinson&#8217;s disease.\nMost people think complementary treatments have no harmful effects. However, some can be harmful and they shouldn&#8217;t be used instead of the medicines prescribed by your doctor.\nSome types of herbal remedies, such as St John&#8217;s wort, can interact unpredictably if taken with some types of medication used to treat Parkinson&#8217;s disease.\nIf you&#8217;re considering using an alternative treatment along with your prescribed medicines, check with your care team first.\nIt&#8217;s important to do what you can to stay physically and mentally healthy if you have Parkinson&#8217;s disease.\nRegular exercise is particularly important in helping relieve muscle stiffness, improving your mood, and relieving stress.\nThere are many activities you can do to help keep yourself fit, ranging from more active sports like tennis and cycling, to less strenuous activities such as walking, gardening and yoga.\nYou should also try to eat a balanced diet containing all the food groups to give your body the nutrition it needs to stay healthy.\nEveryone with a long-term condition is encouraged to get a yearly flu jab each autumn.\nThe pneumococcal vaccination&nbsp;is also usually recommended, which is a one-off injection that protects against a serious chest infection called pneumococcal pneumonia.\nBeing diagnosed with a long-term condition&nbsp;like Parkinson&#8217;s disease can put a strain on you, your family and friends. It can be difficult to talk to people about your condition, even if they&#8217;re close to you.\nDealing with the deterioration of symptoms, such as increasing difficulty with movement, may make you feel frustrated and depressed. Spouses, partners or carers will inevitably feel anxious or frustrated as well.\nBe open about how you feel, and let your family and friends know what they can do to help. Don&#8217;t feel shy about telling them you need some time to yourself, if that&#8217;s what you want.\nIf you have any questions about your condition, your GP or Parkinson&#8217;s disease specialist nurse may be able to help.\nYou may also find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor or psychologist, or someone at a specialist helpline. Your GP surgery will have details of these.\nSome people find it helpful to talk to others with Parkinson&#8217;s disease, either at a local support group or in an internet chat room.\nIt&#8217;s worth taking time to think about your specific needs and what would help you achieve the best quality of life.\nFor example, you may wish to consider equipment, help in your home,&nbsp;and home adaptations.\nParkinson&#8217;s UK is the main Parkinson&#8217;s support and research charity in the UK.\nThey can offer the&nbsp;support and advice you may need if you&#8217;re living with Parkinson&#8217;s disease, and can let you know about support groups in your local area.\nThey can be&nbsp;contacted by:\n- free confidential helpline on 0808 800 0303 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 7pm, and 10am to 2pm on Saturdays)\n- email:&nbsp;hello@parkinsons.org.uk\nThe Parkinson&#8217;s UK&nbsp;website also features all the latest news, publications and research updates, as well as an online community where you can share your experiences of living with Parkinson&#8217;s.\nBeing diagnosed with Parkinson&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t mean you have to stop working. Many people with the condition keep working for years after their diagnosis.\nYou may find it hard to cope financially if you do have to stop work or work part-time because of your condition.\nHowever, you may be entitled to one or more of the following types of financial support:\n- You are entitled to Statutory Sick Pay from your employer if you have a job but can&#8217;t work because of your illness.\n- You may be entitled to Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)&nbsp;if you don&#8217;t have a job and can&#8217;t work because of your illness.\n- You may be eligible for Personal Independence Payment (PIP), which replaced the Disability Living Allowance (DLA), if you&#8217;re aged 64 and under and need help with personal care or have walking difficulties.\n- You may be able to get Attendance Allowance&nbsp;if you&#8217;re aged 65 or over.\n- You may be entitled to Carer&#8217;s Allowance&nbsp;if you&#8217;re caring for someone with Parkinson&#8217;s disease.\n- You may be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home or if you have a low household income.\nIf you&#8217;ve been diagnosed with Parkinson&#8217;s disease, you must inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and your insurance company.\nYou won&#8217;t necessarily have to stop driving. You&#8217;ll be asked to complete a form providing more information about your condition, as well as details of your doctors and specialists. The DVLA will use this to decide whether you&#8217;re fit to drive.\nComplex&nbsp;Parkinson&#8217;s disease is defined as the stage when treatment is unable to consistently control symptoms, or the person has developed&nbsp;uncontrollable jerky movements (disabling dyskinesia).\nThese problems can still be helped by adjustment or addition of some of the medications used to treat Parkinson&#8217;s disease,&nbsp;under the&nbsp;supervision&nbsp;of a doctor with a specialist interest in Parkinson&#8217;s disease.\nAs Parkinson&#8217;s disease progresses, you&#8217;ll be invited to discuss the care you want&nbsp;with your healthcare team as you near the end of your life. This is known as palliative care.\nWhen there&#8217;s no cure for an illness, palliative care tries to alleviate symptoms, and is also aimed at making the end of a person&#8217;s life as comfortable as possible.\nThis is done by attempting to relieve pain and other distressing symptoms, while providing psychological, social and spiritual support for you and your family.\nPalliative care can be provided at home or&nbsp;in a hospice, residential home or hospital. You may want to consider talking to your family and care team in advance about where you&#8217;d like to be treated and what care you wish to receive."

        "disease": "Patau’s syndrome",
        "description": "Patau&#8217;s syndrome, also known as Trisomy 13, is a rare but serious genetic condition. It begins to affect babies when they&#8217;re in the womb, and will continue to cause health problems throughout their life.\nIn the UK, around 2 in every 10,000 births are affected by Patau’s syndrome.\nWhen a baby is conceived (made), they inherit genetic material from both their parents. This genetic material is called a chromosome.\nHumans normally have 23 pairs of chromosomes. In each pair, 1 of the chromosomes is inherited from the mother and 1 is inherited from the father.\nIf a baby has Patau&#8217;s syndrome, they have inherited an extra copy of chromosome 13. This extra copy can be present in some or all of the baby&#8217;s cells and can lead to health problems for the baby.\nThere are 3 different forms of Patau&#8217;s syndrome:\nIn full form Patau&#8217;s syndrome, the baby has inherited a complete extra copy of chromosome 13. This extra copy is present in all of the baby&#8217;s cells.\nAround 80% of babies born with Patau&#8217;s syndrome have the full form of the syndrome.\nIn mosaic form Patau&#8217;s syndrome, the baby has inherited a complete extra copy of chromosome 13, but the copy is only present in some of the baby&#8217;s cells.\nIn partial form Patau&#8217;s syndrome, the baby has only inherited part of an extra copy of chromosome 13. This is a very rare form of Patau&#8217;s syndrome.\nMost cases result from a random change in the egg or sperm in healthy parents. This change is not caused by anything the parents did before or during pregnancy.\nYou’ll be offered&nbsp;screening for Patau&#8217;s syndrome&nbsp;when you&#8217;re between 11 and 14 weeks pregnant.\nThe screening test will show if your baby has a high or low chance of having Patau&#8217;s syndrome.\nIf screening shows that there&#8217;s a high chance your baby has Patau&#8217;s syndrome, you can choose to have a further diagnostic test if you wish.\nIf you receive a very high chance result (between &#8220;1 in 2&#8221; and &#8220;1 in 10&#8221; for Patau&#8217;s syndrome, this may affect your options for further screening. This is because NIPT is less accurate if you&#8217;ve received a very high chance result for Edwards&#8217; syndrome or Patau&#8217;s syndrome. Your healthcare professional will discuss the next options with you.\nNo test can tell if your baby has full, mosaic or partial Patau&#8217;s syndrome, or how they&#8217;ll be affected.\nAround 7 in 10 (70%) of pregnancies diagnosed with Patau&#8217;s syndrome from screening tests will end in&nbsp;miscarriage&nbsp;or&nbsp;stillbirth.\nThe risk of miscarriage decreases as the pregnancy progresses, but there&#8217;s still a risk of stillbirth.\nIf your baby is affected by Patau&#8217;s syndrome, it&#8217;s likely they will have some health conditions. Exactly how your baby is affected will depend on the form of Patau&#8217;s syndrome they have.\nFull form Patau&#8217;s syndrome is considered to be a life-limiting condition. This means it can affect how long a baby can live.\nAround 4 in 10 (43.1%) babies with full form Patau&#8217;s syndrome will live longer than 1 week. Around 1 in 10 (9.7%) will live longer than 5 years.\nBabies born with full form Patau&#8217;s syndrome will have a learning disability that may be severe. They&#8217;re also likely to have a wide range of health conditions, some of which can be serious. Statistically:\n- around 8 in 10 (80%) will have heart issues\n- around 6 in 10 (60%) will have cleft lip and/or palate\n- around 6 in 10 (60%) will have issues with brain development\n- around 5 in 10 (50%) will have seizures\n- around 5 in 10 (50%) will have hearing loss\n- around 5 in 10 (50%) will have joint contractures (shortening of muscle tissue that can cause a deformity)\n- around 5 in 10 (50%) will have eye issues or an absent eye\nCurrently we can&#8217;t predict how babies with mosaic or partial forms of Patau&#8217;s syndrome will be affected. This is because it depends on:\n- how many cells contain the extra chromosome (mosaic)\n- how much of the extra chromosome they have (partial)\nSome babies may have severe health problems like those seen in full form Patau&#8217;s syndrome. Other babies may have much less serious health issues. There are even cases where the baby seems to have no health issues at all.\nMost babies with a form of Patau&#8217;s syndrome will have some form of learning disability.\nThe life expectancy for babies with mosaic or partial forms of Patau&#8217;s syndrome is also very variable. Some will live long lives, while others will have a much shorter life expectancy.\nEach child is unique, and Patau’s syndrome will affect each child differently. Like all children they will have their own personalities, likes and dislikes, and things that make them who they are.\nBabies with full form Patau&#8217;s syndrome usually have a low birthweight and are considered &#8220;medically fragile&#8221;. This means they are at high risk of infections and complications that require treatment in hospital. They may also:\n- have difficulty feeding and may need fed by a tube\n- have difficulty breathing and have apnoea (pauses in their breathing)\nDespite their complex needs, children with Patau&#8217;s syndrome can make progress with their development, although slowly.\nMany children are reported to be able to communicate their needs, show awareness of surroundings, and some can sit and stand supported. There are also cases of older children attending school.\nFeedback from many parents suggests that children with Patau&#8217;s syndrome have a good quality of life and are valued members of the family.\nBabies with Patau&#8217;s syndrome are included in the secure congenital and rare condition (CARDRISS) register. The register is maintained by Public Health Scotland.\nThe register records how many babies have this condition, and some relevant personal information.\nIt&#8217;s also used to support the planning and improvement of health, care, and other public services.\nRead more about CARDRISS\nYou can find out more information about Patau’s syndrome, including stories from parents of a child with the syndrome, at&nbsp;SOFT UK (Support Organisation for Trisomy 13/ 18)"

It affects the female reproductive system including the womb, fallopian tubes and ovaries.\nPID often does not cause any obvious symptoms.\nMost symptoms are mild, making it difficult to diagnose.\nSymptoms include:\n- pain around the pelvis or lower tummy\n- discomfort or pain during sex that is felt deep inside the pelvis\n- pain when peeing\n- bleeding between periods or after sex\n- heavy periods\n- painful periods\n- unusual vaginal discharge\nLess common symptoms include:\n- severe tummy pain\n- a high temperature (fever)\n- feeling and being sick\nIf you think you might have PID, get checked for free by:\n- booking an appointment at your local sexual health service\n- contacting your GP practice for an appointment\nThere is no single test for diagnosing PID.\nYour doctor or nurse will discuss your symptoms before you have an internal examination. This shouldn&#8217;t be painful, but you may experience some discomfort.\nWhen your doctor examines you, they&#8217;ll look for tenderness in your pelvic region and an abnormal vaginal discharge.\nThe doctor will usually take swabs from inside your vagina and cervix. These will be sent to a lab for analysis. However, a swab test can&#8217;t be relied on to diagnose PID, as some women with PID have a negative swab result.\nYou may have an ultrasound scan. Scans can identify severe PID but will not show up mild disease. It&#8217;s possible to have a normal scan and still have PID.\nIf it&#8217;s diagnosed at an early stage, oral antibiotics will treat PID. You&#8217;ll probably be given these to take for at least 2 weeks.\nIn more severe cases, you may be admitted to hospital for observation and treatment with antibiotic injections.\nAlways see your doctor or nurse if you think you might have PID, as the sooner you are treated, the better. If you&#8217;re given treatment, always make sure that you take all of your antibiotics and finish the entire course.\nYour partner(s) should also be treated and you should avoid sex until your treatment is completed.\nMost cases of PID are caused by a bacterial infection that&#8217;s spread from the vagina or the cervix to the reproductive organs higher up.\nMany different types of bacteria can cause PID. However, most cases are the result of a chlamydia or gonorrhoea infection.\nIn some cases, the cause of the infection that leads to PID is unknown. Such cases may be the result of normally harmless bacteria found in the vagina. These bacteria can sometimes get past the cervix and into the reproductive organs.\nIf left untreated, PID can cause serious conditions including:\n- pelvic abscesses\n- long-term pelvic pain, or pelvic pain that keeps coming back\n- reduced fertility or infertility\n- ectopic pregnancy\nThe best way to reduce your risk of STIs is to practice safer sex. This means using a condom for vaginal, anal and oral sex.\nIf you have been diagnosed with PID you should get tested for all STIs including:\n- chlamydia\n- gonorrhoea\n- syphilis"

        "disease": "Pelvic organ prolapse",
        "description": "Pelvic organ prolapse is when one or more of the pelvic organs (your womb, bladder or bowel) slip from their usual position. This causes the vaginal wall to bulge into, or out of, the vagina.\nPelvic organ prolapse isn&#8217;t life-threatening. In some cases it can cause little or no problems. However, in more severe cases, it may feel very uncomfortable. It might stop you doing the things that you enjoy, and affect your quality of life. Like incontinence, prolapse isn&#8217;t an inevitable part of ageing.\nSpeak to your doctor if you think you might have a prolapse. You don’t need to suffer or feel embarrassed. Many women can experience prolapse, but it can be treated.\nSome women with a pelvic organ prolapse don’t have any symptoms at all. The condition may only discovered during an internal examination for another reason. For example, during a&nbsp;cervical screening test (smear test). Other women will experience symptoms. It&#8217;s normal for your symptoms to feel more or less severe at different times of the day.\nYou think you might have a prolapse or you have symptoms of a prolapse such as:\nA prolapse is a common condition. Seeing your doctor earlier may help you manage it more easily.\nYour doctor will need to carry out a pelvic examination, which will include an internal examination of your vagina. Your doctor will discuss this with you and you can ask any questions that you might have.\nAs this is an intimate examination, the doctor may have another person (chaperone) present. You can ask for a female doctor or health professional if you prefer.\nThe internal examination is similar to a smear test and should only take a few minutes. Your doctor will discuss with you if they think any further tests are needed.\nPelvic organ prolapse can affect the front, top or back of vagina. The main types of prolapse are:\n- anterior prolapse (cystocele) – where the bladder bulges into the front wall of the vagina\n- prolapse of the womb and / or cervix (the opening between the vagina and the womb) – where the womb and / or cervix bulges down in to the vagina\n- &#8216;vault’ prolapse – this can be as a result of a total hysterectomy where the new ‘top’ of the vagina bulges downwards\n- posterior wall prolapse (rectocoele or enterocoele) – when the bowel bulges forward into the back wall of the vagina\nYou can have more than one of these types of prolapse at the same time.\nA number system of 1 to 4 is usually used to describe how severe a pelvic organ prolapse is. For example, a 4 means a severe prolapse. You can ask your healthcare professional what this means for you, and any other questions you may have.\nThere isn’t usually one cause, but the risk of developing pelvic organ prolapse is increased by:\n- age – prolapse is more common as you get older, but it&#8217;s not an inevitable part of ageing\n- childbirth – particularly if you had a long or difficult labour, or have given birth to a large baby or multiple babies\n- menopause&nbsp;– related to lower levels of oestrogen or weaker tissue\n- being overweight\n- having large&nbsp;fibroids&nbsp;or pelvic cysts which create a lot of pressure in the pelvis\n- previous surgery on the pelvis – such as a hysterectomy\n- repeated heavy lifting or manual work\n- long term coughing or sneezing (caused by smoking, a lung condition or allergies)\n- straining too much when going to the toilet for a poo because of long term&nbsp;constipation\nThere are things you can do to reduce the risk of pelvic organ prolapse.\nTreatment will depend on how much the issue is affecting your normal day to day activities.\nIn mild cases of prolapse, your doctor may recommend lifestyle changes. For example, regular pelvic floor exercises and maintaining a healthy weight.\nA vaginal pessary is a device inserted into your vagina, which holds your vaginal walls in place and so pushes the prolapse back. Pessaries are usually made of latex (rubber) or silicone, and come in different shapes and sizes.\nA pessary might not be right for everyone. Your doctor will discuss with you to find out if it&#8217;s the best option, and you can ask any questions you may have. Some side effects can include:\n- vaginal discharge\n- irritation, bleeding or sores inside your vagina\n- stress incontinence\n- difficulty with bowel movements\n- difficulty having sex (although most women can have sex without problems)\n- an imbalance of the usual bacteria found in your vagina\nIf you have a pessary and experience any of these symptoms, speak to your healthcare professional. They can usually be treated.\nHRT&nbsp;replaces the female hormones that are at a lower level as you experience the menopause.\nThere is little evidence that HRT can directly treat pelvic organ prolapse, but it can relieve some of the symptoms associated with it. For example, vaginal dryness or discomfort during sex. Depending on your symptoms, you may wish to ask your doctor for more advice on whether this would be a suitable treatment option for you.\nDepending on your circumstances and how severe your symptoms are, your doctor may discuss with you whether a surgery might be helpful. They will go through the options with you.\nIt&#8217;s ok to ask any questions about your care&nbsp;to help you get the information you might need. You can then take some time to decide what the best option is for you."

        "disease": "Peripheral neuropathy",
        "description": "Peripheral neuropathy develops when the peripheral nerves are damaged. The symptoms experienced depend on which nerves are affected.\nIn the UK, it’s estimated that almost 1 in 10 people aged 55 or over are affected by peripheral neuropathy.\nThe peripheral nervous system is the network of nerves that lie outside the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). This includes nerves in the feet and hands.\nPeripheral nerves:\n- transmit sensations like pain and touch\n- controlling muscles\nregulate some body functions like blood pressure\nThere are 4 types of peripheral neuropathy:\n- sensory neuropathy &#8211; damage to the nerves that carry sensations like touch, temperature and pain\n- motor neuropathy &#8211; damage to the nerves that control movement\n- autonomic neuropathy &#8211; damage to the nerves that control bodily functions like digestion, bladder function and blood pressure\n- mononeuropathy &#8211; damage to a single nerve outside the central nervous system\nOften people have more than 1 type of peripheral neuropathy at the same time.\nSymptoms of peripheral neuropathy can vary depending on which type you have. They can also develop quickly or slowly.\n- a prickling or tingling sensation in the affected body part\n- &#8216;pins and needles&#8217; in the affected body part\n- a burning or sharp pain, usually in the feet\n- numbness in the affected body part\n- being less able to feel pain or changes in temperature, particularly in your feet\n- being more able to feel pain, to the point that even a light touch causes you pain (allodynia)\n- the loss of balance or co-ordination (sensory ataxia)\n- twitching and muscle cramps\n- muscle weakness or paralysis that affects 1 or more muscles\n- thinning (wasting) of your muscles\n- foot drop (difficulty lifting the front part of your foot) that causes you to trip\n- constipation or diarrhoea, particularly at night\n- feeling sick, bloating and belching\n- low blood pressure, which can make you feel faint or dizzy when standing up\n- rapid heartbeat\n- problems with the amount you sweat (either too much or too little)\n- problems with sexual function, like erectile dysfunction\n- difficulty fully emptying your bladder\nThe symptoms of mononeuropathy can vary because they depend on which specific nerve has been affected. Example symptoms could include:\n- pain, weakness or altered sensation your fingers, feet or shins\n- double vision or other problems with focusing your eyes, sometimes with eye pain\n- weakness of one side of your face (Bell’s palsy)\n- Carpal tunnel syndrome\nDiabetes (both type 1 and type 2) is the most common cause of peripheral neuropathy. This is called diabetic polyneuropathy\nThe high blood sugar levels associated with diabetes can damage the nerves, causing diabetes.\nPeripheral neuropathy becomes more likely the longer you’ve had diabetes.\nYour risk of diabetic polyneuropathy is higher if:\n- your blood sugar is poorly controlled\n- you smoke\n- you regularly consume large amounts of alcohol\n- you&#8217;re over 40 years old\nThere are many other possible causes of peripheral neuropathy. These can include:\n- monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (the presence of abnormal protein in the blood)\n- cancers like lymphoma (cancer of the lymphatic system) and multiple myeloma (bone marrow cancer)\n- low levels of vitamins like vitamin B12\n- drinking too much alcohol for a long period of time\n- malnutrition (poor diet)\n- some types of chemotherapy for cancer, particularly those used for bowel cancer, breast cancer, lymphoma or myeloma\n- genetic conditions that cause nerve damage, like Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease\n- some medications when taken for a long time, like metronidazole, nitrofurantoin, phenytoin, amiodarone and thalidomide\n- physical injury to the nerves\n- infections like shingles, lyme disease, diphtheria, botulism and HIV\n- hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid gland)\n- chronic kidney disease or liver disease\n- conditions caused by an overactive immune system, like rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Sjogren&#8217;s syndrome or vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels)\n- rare conditions like Guillain-Barré syndrome and amyloidosis\n- exposure to high levels of toxins, like arsenic, lead or mercury\nIf you&#8217;ve got symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, you should make an appointment with your GP. They&#8217;ll ask about your symptoms and may arrange some tests to help find out the underlying cause.\nIf you’re taking a medication known to cause peripheral neuropathy, your GP may temporarily stop or reduce your dose to see whether your symptoms improve.\nDo not stop taking any prescribed medication without checking with your GP or healthcare provider first. You could make yourself very ill.\nIf your GP isn&#8217;t sure what&#8217;s causing your peripheral neuropathy, you may be referred to a neurologist. This is a specialist in conditions affecting the nervous system. They may do some further tests.\nGenerally, the sooner peripheral neuropathy is diagnosed, the better. Early diagnosis gives you the best chance of limiting the damage and preventing further complications.\nYou have:\nThe outlook for peripheral neuropathy varies. It depends on:\n- the underlying cause\n- which nerves have been damaged\n- how severe the damage is\nIf the underlying cause of your peripheral neuropathy can be treated, it may improve with treatment and time. For example, if your diabetes is well controlled, it may stop neuropathy getting worse. You may also find your neuropathy improves.\nIt may be that the underlying cause of your peripheral neuropathy cannot be treated. In these cases, the damage may be permanent, and may get worse with time.\nPeripheral neuropathy can cause further complications to your health. Some of these can be severe. They can include:\n- cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy – when damage to the peripheral nerves cause problems with your heartbeat and blood circulation\n- diabetic foot ulcers – when damaged to your blood vessels cause wounds to take an unusually long time to heal, leading to further problems\nEven if the cause of your peripheral neuropathy cannot be treated, you can get help with managing your symptoms.\nIf you&#8217;re in pain, you may be prescribed different types of medication. This is because standard painkillers (like ibuprofen and paracetamol) are often not effective at treating nerve pain.\nIf you&#8217;re experiencing pain in a particular area of your body, capsaicin cream may help. Capsaicin is the substance that makes chilli peppers hot. It&#8217;s thought to stop the nerves sending pain messages to the brain, making it useful for nerve pain. Menthol cream can have a similar effect.\nIf your pain only affects a small area of skin, you may be offered a lidocaine plaster. This is a large sticking plaster that contains a local anaesthetic, which is absorbed into the skin the plaster covers.\nIf topical measures do not work, your GP may consider a neuropathic agent. These include some types of anti-depressants .\nIf you&#8217;re struggling with muscle weakness, you may benefit from physiotherapy. It can help improve weakness.\nOccupational therapy can help you find new ways of completing difficult tasks.\nIf you have foot drop or tripping, orthotics can help with ankle supports.\nIf you&#8217;re experiencing hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), you may be offered botulinum toxin (botox) injections. These could help reduce your sweating.\nIf you&#8217;re struggling to empty your bladder, you may be offered urodynamic studies. Depending on the result, you may be offered medication or urinary catheterisation to help you."

For example, depression or drug and alcohol misuse.\nPersonality disorders are a common mental health problem. They usually emerge in adolescence and continue into adulthood.\nPersonality disorders may be mild, moderate or severe. People may have periods of “remission” where they function well.\nPersonality disorders may be connected to genetic and family factors.\nExperiencing distress or fear during childhood can also contribute to a personality disorder. For example, experiencing neglect or abuse.\nSymptoms usually get worse with stress.\nTreatment for a personality disorder usually involves therapy or medicine.\nA range of different psychotherapies are used to treat personality disorders. For example, talking therapy.\nPsychological therapy involves discussing your thoughts, emotions and behaviours with a trained professional. This aims to help you control your thoughts and emotions.\nSome therapies, especially group therapies, help people understand social relationships better.\nThe psychotherapist will listen and discuss important issues with you. They can also suggest strategies to resolve problems. If necessary, they’ll help you change your attitudes and behaviour.\nPsychological therapy treatment usually lasts at least 6 months. But, it may last longer depending on the severity of the condition and other problems.\nMedicine may be prescribed to treat problems associated with a personality disorder, including:\n- depression\n- anxiety\n- psychotic symptoms\nMind has information and guidance for friends and family of someone diagnosed with a personality disorder. This includes information on how to look after yourself while supporting someone else.\nObsessive compulsive personality is different to obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).\nPeople with OCD are aware that their behaviour is abnormal and are anxious about it. Whereas, most people with obsessive compulsive personality disorder think their behaviour is acceptable. They usually have no desire to change it.\nSome people with OCD feel the need to carry out rituals. For example, having to touch every second lamppost as they walk down the street. This is not usually the case with people with obsessive compulsive personality disorder.\nPeople with OCD may feel the need to make lists or organise items in their house, but feel anxious about doing so. People with obsessive compulsive personality disorder feel less anxiety through such tasks. They may become irritated when prevented from doing so."

        "disease": "Plantar heel pain",
        "description": "This information is useful for those who have been diagnosed with plantar heel pain. People experiencing new or ongoing symptoms should contact a healthcare professional for assessment and diagnosis.\nRead more about self-managing a foot problem\nPlantar heel pain, or pain in the heel at the sole of the foot, is a common foot problem. This is called plantar fasciopathy, which used to be known as plantar fasciitis.\nThe pain is usually worse first thing in the morning, or when you first take a step after a period of inactivity. The symptoms usually build up gradually and get worse over time.\nThe plantar fascia is a tough and flexible band of tissue that runs under the sole of the foot. It connects the heel bone with your toes, and acts as a shock absorber to the foot.\nSudden or repeated stresses can cause the plantar fascia to thicken, resulting in heel pain. The surrounding muscles and the heel bone can also be involved.\nIt&#8217;s unlikely you would need an x-ray or scan unless it&#8217;s to rule out another condition.\nPlantar heel pain is often referred to as a self limiting condition. This means it can get better on its own over time. There are things you can do yourself that can help relieve heel pain and speed up your recovery.\nExercises designed to stretch both your calf muscles and your plantar fascia should help relieve pain and improve flexibility in the affected foot.\nLearn about exercises for foot conditions\nWhile recovering you should try to stay as active as you can.\nRemember a little activity is better than nothing. Continue to stay within acceptable pain limits but remember you don’t need to be pain free. Aim to do a little bit more each day or every few days.\nThis guide can help you to understand if you&#8217;re pacing your daily activities at the right level as you build your movement levels up. It&#8217;ll also let you see how much pain or discomfort is acceptable.\nIt can be helpful to rate your pain out of 10 (0 being no pain, 10 being the worst pain you&#8217;ve ever had), for example:\n- 0 to 3 &#8211; minimal pain\n- 4 to 5 &#8211; acceptable pain\n- 6 to 10 &#8211; excessive pain\nAim to keep your pain within a rating of 0 to 5. If your pain gets above this level, you can change the level of activity by:\n- reducing the number of times you do a movement\n- reducing the pace of an activity\n- increasing rest time between activities\nActivity shouldn&#8217;t make your existing pain worse overall. Increasing activity can lead to increased discomfort as your body gets used to regaining your activity levels. This kind of pain should ease quickly and your pain should be no worse the morning after.\nThe following can help to reduce the pain:\n- pain medication &#8211; this can help you move more comfortably, which can help your recovery\n- ice packs\nMore about taking painkillers\nIce can be beneficial in the initial stages of plantar heel pain.\nNever place ice directly on your skin. Use a barrier, like a towel, to protect your skin from a burn.\nHow long you use ice as a treatment can vary. However, you should generally apply ice for up to 15 minutes. You should also leave a few hours between treatments.\nYou should stop treating the area with ice and seek advice from a medical professional if you notice the skin in the area has:\n- an increase in redness\n- discolouration\n- blistering\nIf you have any issues with circulation or sensation, you shouldn&#8217;t use ice as a treatment for heel pain.\nA foot problem can sometimes mean you need to take some time off work to help recovery. How long you&#8217;re off will depend on the nature of your condition and your role at work.\nYou do not need to be symptom free before you consider returning to work. Continuing to go to work, or returning to work as soon as is possible for you, will help your recovery. Gradually getting back to your normal daily activities can help to build up your strength and stamina levels\nFollowing this advice, you should see gradual improvements over time.\nTalk to a healthcare professional about your symptoms if you&#8217;ve been following this advice and:\n- your symptoms haven&#8217;t improved within 12 weeks\n- your symptoms are worsening\nFind out how to access MSK services in your area\nWhen dealing with any health condition it&#8217;s important to also look after&nbsp;your mental wellbeing&nbsp;as this can impact your recovery."

        "disease": "Pleurisy",
        "description": "Pleurisy is inflammation of the layers that cover the lungs (the pleura). It causes sharp chest pain (pleuritic pain) that gets worse when breathing or coughing.\nIt can affect people of all ages. People aged 65 years and over are most at risk because they&#8217;re more likely to get a chest infection.\nIf your GP is closed, phone 111.\nPleurisy can usually be diagnosed by checking your symptoms. Your GP can listen to your chest to check for sounds that suggest you may have pleurisy.\nFurther tests may be needed to find the underlying cause and how severe it is. Tests can include:\n- blood tests to determine whether you have an infection or an autoimmune condition\n- chest X-rays\n- an ultrasound scan\n- a computerised tomography (CT) scan\n- a biopsy – a small sample of pleural or lung tissue is removed for further testing\nTreatment for pleurisy depends on the underlying cause.\nFor example, pleurisy caused by a viral infection will often resolve itself without treatment. However, pleurisy caused by a bacterial infection is usually treated with antibiotics. People who are frail or already in poor health may be admitted to hospital.\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, are often used to relieve the chest pain.\nIf excess fluid builds up between the pleural layers, it may need drained to prevent breathing difficulties. This is known as pleural effusion.\nMost cases are the result of a viral infection (such as the flu) or a bacterial infection (such as pneumonia). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) can cause pleurisy, especially in hospital patients. MRSA is a type of bacteria with a resistance to a number of commonly used antibiotics.\nIn rarer cases, pleurisy can be caused by conditions such as a blood clot or lung cancer."

        "disease": "Pneumonia",
        "description": "Pneumonia is inflammation of the lung tissue. It&#8217;s usually caused by a bacterial infection. There are clusters of tiny air sacs in your lungs. If you have pneumonia, these tiny sacs become inflamed and fill up with fluid.\nThe symptoms of pneumonia can develop suddenly over 24 to 48 hours, or they may come on more slowly over several days.\nPneumonia is more widespread in autumn and winter.\nIf your GP practice is closed, phone 111.\nYour GP may be able to diagnose pneumonia by asking about your symptoms and examining your chest. Further tests may be needed in some cases.\nPneumonia can be difficult to diagnose because it has similar symptoms to other conditions. For example the common cold, bronchitis and asthma.\nTo help make a diagnosis, your GP may ask you:\n- whether you feel breathless\n- if you&#8217;re breathing faster than usual\n- how long you&#8217;ve had your cough\n- whether you&#8217;re coughing up mucus and if so, what colour it is\n- if the pain in your chest is worse when you breathe in or out\nYour GP may also take your temperature and listen to your chest and back with a stethoscope to check for any crackling or rattling sounds.\nThey may also listen to your chest by tapping it. Lungs filled with fluid produce a different sound from normal healthy lungs.\nIf you have mild pneumonia, you may need a chest X-ray and some blood tests. You will not need a sputum sample unless you have recurrent infections, or persistent infections that don&#8217;t respond to treatments.\nMild pneumonia can usually be treated at home.\nPneumonia isn&#8217;t usually passed from one person to another. So it&#8217;s safe to be around others, including family members. But people with a weakened immune system should avoid close contact with a person with pneumonia until they start to get better.\nCough medicines aren&#8217;t recommended. A warm honey and lemon drink can help relieve discomfort caused by coughing.\nIf you smoke, it&#8217;s more important than ever to stop, as smoking damages your lungs.\nFull recovery from pneumonia can take up to 3 months.\nSpeak to your GP if your symptoms don&#8217;t improve within 3 days of starting antibiotics.\nYou may need treatment in hospital if your symptoms are severe. You may be given antibiotics and fluids intravenously through a drip, and you may need oxygen if your blood oxygen levels are low.\nIn very serious cases of pneumonia, breathing assistance through a ventilator in a high dependency unit (HDU) or an intensive care unit (ICU) may be required.\nYour GP may arrange a follow-up appointment for you. In some cases, they may arrange follow-up tests if:\n- your symptoms haven&#8217;t improved\n- your symptoms have come back\n- you smoke\n- you&#8217;re over the age of 50\nSome people may be advised to have a flu vaccination or pneumococcal vaccination after recovering.\nPneumonia is commonly the result of pneumococcal infection. A bacteria called Streptococcus pneumoniae causes pneumococcal infection. Other causes of pneumonia are:\n- other types of bacteria including Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus\n- viruses\n- fungi (rarely)\nAs well as bacterial pneumonia, other types include:\n- viral pneumonia – viruses including the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronavirus (COVID-19) and sometimes influenza type A or B; viruses are a common cause of pneumonia in young children\n- aspiration pneumonia – caused by breathing in vomit, a foreign object, such as a peanut, or a harmful substance, such as smoke or a chemical\n- fungal pneumonia – rare in the UK and more likely to affect people with a weakened immune system\n- hospital-acquired pneumonia – pneumonia that develops in hospital while being treated for another condition or having an operation; people in intensive care on breathing machines are particularly at risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia\nPneumonia can affect people of any age. It&#8217;s more common – and can be more serious – in certain groups of people. People in these risk groups are more likely to need hospital treatment.\nThe groups with an increased risk of developing pneumonia are:\n- babies and very young children\n- elderly people\n- people who smoke\n- people with other health conditions, such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, or a heart, kidney or liver condition\n- people with a weakened immune system"

        "disease": "Polio",
        "description": "Polio is a serious viral infection that used to be common in the UK and worldwide. It&#8217;s rare nowadays because it can be prevented with vaccination.\nMost people with polio don&#8217;t have any symptoms and won&#8217;t know they&#8217;re infected.\nBut for up to 1 in 100 people, the polio virus causes temporary or permanent paralysis, which can be life threatening.\nCases of polio in the UK fell dramatically when routine vaccination was introduced in the mid-1950s.\nThere hasn&#8217;t been a case of polio caught in the UK since the mid-90s. But the infection is still found in some parts of the world, and there remains a very small risk it could be brought back to the UK.\nThere&#8217;s no cure for polio, so it&#8217;s important to make sure that you and your children are fully vaccinated against it.\nAbout 95% of people with polio won&#8217;t have any symptoms and will fight off the infection without even realising they were infected.\nA small number of people will experience a&nbsp;flu-like illness 3 to 21 days after they&#8217;re infected.\nSymptoms can include:\n- a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above\n- a&nbsp;sore throat\n- a&nbsp;headache\n- abdominal (tummy) pain\n- aching muscles\n- feeling and being sick\nThese symptoms will usually pass within about a week.\nIn less than 1% of cases, the polio virus attacks the nerves in the spine and base of the brain. This can cause paralysis, usually in the legs, that develops over hours or days.\nThe paralysis isn&#8217;t usually permanent, and movement will often slowly return over the next few weeks and months.\nBut some people are left with persistent problems. If the breathing muscles are affected, it can be life threatening.\nAlthough polio often passes quickly without causing any other problems, it can sometimes lead to persistent or lifelong difficulties.\nAbout 1 in every 200 people with the infection will have some degree of permanent paralysis, and others may be left with problems that require long-term treatment and support.\nThese can include:\n- muscle weakness\n- shrinking of the muscles (atrophy)\n- tight joints (contractures)\n- deformities, such as twisted feet or legs\nThere&#8217;s also a chance that someone who&#8217;s had polio in the past will develop similar symptoms again, or worsening of their existing symptoms, many decades later. This is known as post-polio syndrome.\nYou can become infected with the polio virus if you come into contact with the poo (faeces) of someone with the infection, or with the droplets launched into the air when they cough or sneeze.\nYou can also get the infection from food or water that&#8217;s been contaminated with infected poo or droplets.\nIf the virus gets into your mouth, it travels to your throat and bowels, where it starts to multiply. In some cases, it can also get into the bloodstream and spread to the nervous system.\nThe virus can be spread by someone with the infection from about a week before any symptoms develop, until several weeks afterwards. Infected people who don&#8217;t have any symptoms can still pass polio on to others.\nThere have been rare cases where polio has been caused by being vaccinated with a live version of the polio virus.\nThis is no longer a risk in the UK because the vaccine used nowadays contains an inactive version of the virus.\nAs a result of routine vaccination programmes, polio has been largely wiped out in most parts of the world.\nAreas declared polio-free by the World Health Organization (WHO) include Europe, the Americas, the western Pacific region and, most recently, southeast Asia.\nBut polio is found in some places. It&#8217;s still a significant problem in Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan, and there&#8217;s a potential risk of infection in other parts of Africa and some Middle Eastern countries.\nYou can use the Travel Health Pro website to check if there&#8217;s a risk of getting polio in a country you plan to visit.\nUse the website&#8217;s country guide for further information.\nThere&#8217;s currently no cure for polio. Treatment focuses on supporting bodily functions and reducing the risk of long-term problems while the body fights off the infection.\nThis can include bed rest in hospital, painkillers, breathing support and regular stretches or exercises to prevent problems with the muscles and joints.\nIf you&#8217;re left with long-term problems as a result of a polio infection, you&#8217;ll probably need ongoing treatment and support.\nThis may include physiotherapy to help with any movement problems, devices such as splints and braces to support weak limbs or joints,&nbsp;occupational therapy&nbsp;to help you adapt to any difficulties, and possibly surgery to correct any deformities.\nThe polio vaccine is offered as part of the&nbsp;NHS routine childhood immunisation programme.\nIt&#8217;s given in 5 separate doses:\n- at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age – as part of the&nbsp;6-in-1 (DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB) vaccine\n- at 3 years and 4 months of age – as part of the&nbsp;4-in-1 (DTaP/IPV) pre-school booster\n- between 13 and 18 years of age – as part of the&nbsp;3-in-1 (Td/IPV) teenage booster\nIf you&#8217;re planning to travel to a polio-affected country, you should get immunised if you&#8217;ve not been fully immunised before, or have a booster dose if it&#8217;s been 10 years or more since your last dose of the vaccine.\nRead more about&nbsp;travel immunisations\nYou can also get immunised at any point if you haven&#8217;t been fully immunised before, even if you&#8217;re not travelling somewhere where there&#8217;s a risk of infection.\nIf you&#8217;ve had polio in the past and haven&#8217;t been immunised, it&#8217;s still recommended that you get fully immunised.\nThere are 3 types of polio virus that the vaccine protects against, and people who have had the infection before will only be immune to one of these.\nThe polio immunisation is routinely offered for free on the NHS.\nAs the result of an increase in worldwide cases of polio in early 2014, the WHO issued temporary additional travel recommendations for people visiting countries where polio is found.\nDepending on where you intend to travel, what you&#8217;ll be doing there and how long you&#8217;re staying for, you may now be advised to have a booster polio immunisation before travelling if you haven&#8217;t had one in the past 12 months.\nSome of the countries where there&#8217;s risk of infection will require proof of immunisation before you&#8217;re permitted to travel elsewhere. If you don&#8217;t have this, you may be given a booster dose before departing."

        "disease": "Polymyalgia rheumatica",
        "description": "Polymyalgia rheumatica is a condition that causes pain, stiffness and inflammation. This is mostly around the shoulders, neck and hips.\nPolymyalgia rheumatica often causes pain and stiffness. This can affect the shoulders, neck and hips. These symptoms can develop quickly over a few days or weeks. Both sides of the body are usually affected.\nThe stiffness often feels worse first thing in the morning after you wake up. It usually starts to improve after about 45 minutes as you become more active.\nPolymyalgia rheumatica may also cause:\n- high temperature (fever) and sweating\n- extreme tiredness (fatigue)\n- loss of appetite\n- weight loss\n- depression\nYou have been diagnosed with polymyalgia rheumatic and you suddenly develop:\nIf you have been diagnosed with polymyalgia rheumatica and you suddenly develop vision loss or changes in your vision, like double vision, contact an optician immediately or phone 111.\nIt can take a long time to diagnose polymyalgia rheumatica. You may need different tests to help diagnose it. This is because it shares symptoms with other health conditions that need to be ruled out first.\nThere&#8217;s no specific test for polymyalgia rheumatic. But you should have blood tests to look for things like signs of inflammation before starting any corticosteroid treatment.\nAn X-ray or ultrasound scan may also be used to look at the condition of your bones and joints.\nThe cause of polymyalgia rheumatica is unknown. But, genetic and environmental factors can influence it.\nPolymyalgia rheumatica is also age-related. Most people who are diagnosed with the condition are over 70. It’s very rare in people younger than 50.\nPolymyalgia rheumatic is more common in women than men.\nThe main treatment for polymyalgia rheumatica is a corticosteroid medication called prednisolone. This comes as a pill that&#8217;s prescribed by your GP.\nPrednisolone blocks certain chemicals that cause inflammation in the body.\nYou’ll be prescribed a higher dose of prednisolone at first. This will be slowly reduced over time. This is likely to be over a year.\nSometimes you may be prescribed other medicines with corticosteroids. This can help to prevent relapses or it may allow your dose of prednisolone to be reduced. Additional medicines are usually added by rheumatology doctors. They include a weekly dose of methotrexate or a daily dose of leflunomide.\nPainkillers may also be recommended. These can be helpful if you also have arthritis or chronic pain.\nThere are side effects linked to taking steroids long-term. This means your healthcare professional may also prescribe medication to protect your bones. For example, calcium and vitamin D supplements and bisphosphonates. You may also be prescribed proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to protect your stomach.\nIf you have been diagnosed with polymyalgia rheumatica, you will need to have regular appointments at your GP practice. They will check:\n- how well you&#8217;re responding to treatment\n- whether your dose of prednisolone needs to be adjusted\n- how well you&#8217;re coping with the side effects of the medication\nYou will also have blood tests at these appointments.\nYou will usually have a follow-up appointment within a week of starting your steroid treatment. This is to check how you are responding to them. You&#8217;ll then have checks regularly to make sure the inflammation levels in your blood are normal while the steroids are being gradually reduced.\nYou should speak to your GP practice if your symptoms return during any part of your treatment. This is because the dosage of your medication may need to be adjusted. Your GP may refer you to a rheumatologist.\nYou can find other sources of information and support with polymyalgia rheumatica at:\n- PMR-GCA Scotland\n- Versus Arthritis\n- Royal Osteoporosis Society"

        "disease": "Post-concussion syndrome",
        "description": "Post-concussion syndrome (PCS) describes a set of symptoms that sometimes happen after a concussion. They can last for several weeks or months.\nThe exact cause of PCS is not known. One theory is that PCS is the result of a chemical imbalance in the brain. This imbalance is triggered by the injury that caused the initial concussion. Another theory suggests PCS may be caused by damage to nerve cells in the brain.\nThe symptoms of PCS can be physical, psychological or cognitive (affecting your ability to think). You may have more than one type of symptom at a time, but are unlikely to have them all.\n- persistent headaches that can be mild or severe, but last a long time\n- dizziness\n- nausea (feeling sick)\n- sensitivity to bright lights\n- sensitivity to loud noises\n- tinnitus (ringing in the ears)\n- double or blurred vision\n- fatigue (tiredness)\n- changed or reduced sense of smell and taste\n- depression\n- anxiety\n- irritability\n- lack of energy\n- loss of interest in activities you normally enjoy\n- problems sleeping\n- changes in appetite\n- sudden outbursts of emotion, like crying for no clear reason\n- decreased concentration\n- forgetfulness\n- difficulty remembering things or learning new information\n- difficulties with reasoning (working out problems)\nYour symptoms may make it difficult to work and look after yourself.\nPCS does not show on any scans or blood tests. This means that your healthcare professional will diagnose PCS using:\n- your medical history (that you&#8217;ve experienced a recent head injury)\n- the types symptoms you&#8217;re experiencing\n- when your symptoms began (before or after a head injury)\nThere&#8217;s no specific treatment that cures PCS. But there are a lot of strategies that can help. For most patients the symptoms gradually improve over time.\nPacing strategies are often used to help manage PCS. These are strategies that allow you to gradually increase your activities. They can help you return to work and leisure activities.\nSome activities can make PCS symptoms worse. You should avoid overstimulating activities that make your symptoms worse. These might include:\n- late nights\n- alcohol\n- crowded rooms\n- conversations with multiple people at once\n- vigorous exercises\n- prolonged screen time\nYou may be prescribed antidepressants or anti-migraine medication. This doesn&#8217;t mean your healthcare professional thinks you&#8217;re depressed or experiencing migraines. These medicines work by reducing abnormal nerve activity in the brain. This means they can help with the physical symptoms of PCS.\nIf you&#8217;re experiencing psychological symptoms, antidepressants can also help with this. Your healthcare professional may also suggest talking treatments (like psychological therapy)."

        "disease": "Post-polio syndrome",
        "description": "Post-polio syndrome is a slow progressive condition that affects some people that have had polio. It&#8217;s not life threatening but it can cause problems in your ability to carry out daily activities.\nPolio is a serious viral infection that used to be common in the UK and worldwide. It&#8217;s rarer now because it can be prevented with vaccination.\nIn around 1 in 100 people, the polio virus causes paralysis, which in rare cases can be life threatening.\nCases of polio in the UK fell dramatically when routine vaccination was introduced in the mid-1950s.\nThe symptoms of post-polio syndrome include:\n- muscle weakness\n- shrinking of the muscles (atrophy)\n- tight joints (contractures)\n- pain in muscles or joints\n- chronic fatigue including physical tiredness and brain fatigue\n- swallowing and speech problems\n- respiratory problems like breathlessness and sleep apnoea\n- cramps and muscle twitching\n- being sensitive to cold temperatures\nThe muscle weakness and atrophy usually affects muscles that were previously affected by polio. Sometimes it affects other muscles.\nThis can impact your mobility and your ability to do everyday tasks like brushing your teeth or drying your hair.\nChronic fatigue is one of the most common and troublesome symptoms of post-polio syndrome. This can be physical fatigue (tiredness) and brain fatigue. Brain fatigue can cause problems with concentration, attention and memory. MRI scans can show white spots in the brains of polio survivors which may be related to brain fatigue.\nThe symptoms can gradually get worse over many years. There are supportive treatments that can help with symptoms.\nAlthough post-polio syndrome is rarely life threatening, some people can develop breathing and swallowing difficulties that can lead to serious problems like chest infections.\nSome people experience a sensitivity to some types of anaesthesia causing them to take longer to recover from having anaesthesia.\nPost-polio syndrome is caused by the polio virus. It only affects people who&#8217;ve had polio although it can take 15 &#8211; 40 years after the infection for it to develop. It&#8217;s not known if there&#8217;s anything that can be done to prevent it.\nThe exact cause behind who&#8217;ll experience post-polio syndrome after having the polio virus is unclear.\nIt could be because of gradual degeneration (breaking down) of nerve cells (motor neurones) in the brainstem or spinal cord that were damaged by the polio virus. This gradual change explains why it can take years for post-polio syndrome symptoms to appear.\nDuring recovery from polio, surviving motor neurone cells grow new nerve ends to connect with other muscle fibres. This helps to regain muscle strength as someone recovers from the polio virus.\nOver time, these new nerve ends put the motor neurone cell under stress. The cells slowly break down, resulting in the loss of muscle strength.\nPeople who have had severe polio at a young age or during adolescence (teenage years) might be more likely to experience post-polio syndrome. People who had a more serious infection in early adulthood are also more likely to develop post-polio syndrome.\nPost-polio syndrome is not contagious.\nIt can be difficult to diagnose post-polio syndrome. There are no specific tests for it, and it can be mistaken for other conditions.\nYour GP might suspect post-polio syndrome if:\n- you had polio followed by a long period of stable symptoms (usually 15 years)\n- your symptoms have developed gradually\nThe symptoms of post-polio syndrome are slow and progressive. The sudden appearance of symptoms is more likely to be caused by something else. A prolonged period of bed rest as a result of another illness or serious injury can trigger post-polio syndrome symptoms.\nThere are some tests that can be done to rule out conditions with similar symptoms.\nYou might be offered blood tests and scans of your spine.\nOther tests that might be offered include:\n- electromyography (EMG) tests &#8211; these will measure the electrical activity in your nerves and muscles and detect damage that may have been caused by having polio\n- sleep studies &#8211; if you&#8217;re experiencing sleep apnoea or you&#8217;re feeling unusually tired\n- tests to check your heart function and heart rate\n- a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan or computerised tomography (CT) scan of your brain, spine and muscles\n- lung function tests like a spirometry to measure your breathing\n- test to investigate dysphagia (swallowing problems)\nAs there&#8217;s no cure for post-polio syndrome, treatment will help you manage your symptoms and quality of life.\nIt&#8217;s likely you&#8217;ll have a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals working together to care for you including:\n- neurologists\n- respiratory specialists\n- physiotherapists\n- orthotists\n- psychologists\n- pain management specialists\n- occupational therapists\nThey&#8217;ll discuss the most suitable plan for your care which might include a mixture of the following:\nExercise can help slow down the progressive muscle weakness that post-polio syndrome causes. However, being active can become difficult because your symptoms might become worse after exercise or activity. Any exercise should be pain free because too much exercise can cause more damage. You should pace yourself to avoid becoming exhausted from exercise.\nYour healthcare team might suggest you try using pacing techniques. This might involve:\n- prioritising tasks\n- finding different ways of doing tasks which prevent pain or exhaustion\n- getting help from others to do particularly exhausting tasks\n- taking regular breaks and having rest periods regularly throughout your day\n- doing some regular gentle exercise that you can gradually build up and stopping before you become exhausted\nPacing can help you prevent becoming worn out. It can help to space out activities throughout the day to allow for rest periods where you can recover in between.\nMaking effective and efficient use of your muscles and strength in this way can help them to last longer.\nMedication to relieve pain might be used in addition to pacing techniques. Your healthcare team might suggest over the counter painkillers like aspirin, paracetamol or ibuprofen. Other stronger anti-inflammatory drugs and opiates might be considered too depending on individual needs.\nTalk to your GP if you&#8217;re taking over the counter medicines as they shouldn&#8217;t be used long term. They can cause complications like stomach ulcers if taken over a long period of time.\nYour healthcare team or GP might suggest medication like gabapentin or pregabalin for your pain if over the counter medications aren&#8217;t working.\nWhen taking medication for your pain, you might not feel the damage being caused to your muscles and joints through too much activity. This means it&#8217;s important you follow your pacing routine even when you don&#8217;t feel tired or aren&#8217;t in any pain.\nYou might benefit from a mobility aid like:\n- braces to support weakened muscles and joints, prevent falls and improve posture\n- walking sticks to help you balance and prevent falls\n- an electric scooter\n- a wheelchair\nYour healthcare team will discuss the most suitable options for you depending on your needs. Many mobility aids are provided for free by the NHS.\nIf you have breathing problems, you might benefit from treatment or lifestyle changes.\nYour breathing problems will be assessed to identify the cause. For example, your breathing problems might be caused by stiff ribs, scoliosis or weak respiratory muscles. Finding the cause will help to choose the correct treatment for you.\nYou might be offered a machine to deliver pressurised air into your lungs through a mask during sleep. This is to help stop your airways closing if you have sleep apnoea.\nThere are exercises you can do to increase the strength of your breathing muscles. A respiratory physiotherapist will help you to find suitable and safe exercises for you.\nYour healthcare team might suggest you have the pneumococcal vaccination, COVID-19 vaccines and annual flu jab. This is to reduce your risk of getting chest infections which can cause further complications.\nIf you smoke, stopping smoking can help improve your breathing too.\nIf you&#8217;re overweight, you might be putting your weakened muscles under further pressure. This can cause problems with your energy levels and overall health.\nLosing weight (if you&#8217;re overweight) can help improve your symptoms and general health.\nYour healthcare team can tell you about specific exercises suitable for you.\nEating a healthy, balanced diet can help you reduce and control your weight. It&#8217;ll also improve your general health. Following a plan that includes healthy foods that provide energy that&#8217;s released slowly over time can help improve your symptoms.\nRead our Eatwell Guide: How to eat a healthy balanced diet \nThe symptoms of post-polio syndrome can be distressing.\nDeveloping post-polio syndrome after living with the polio virus as a child can cause anxiety, isolation and stress. This can lead to depression.\nSpeak to your GP if you&#8217;re feeling down and you no longer enjoy things you used to."

        "description": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder caused by very stressful, frightening or distressing events.\nSomeone with PTSD often relives the traumatic event through nightmares and flashbacks, and may experience feelings of isolation, irritability and guilt.\nThey may also have problems sleeping, such as insomnia, and find concentrating difficult.\nThese symptoms are often severe and&nbsp;persistent enough to have a significant impact on the person’s day-to-day life.\nRead more about the symptoms of PTSD.\nThe type of events that can cause PTSD include:\n- serious road accidents\n- violent personal assaults, such as sexual assault, mugging or robbery\n- prolonged sexual abuse, violence or severe neglect\n- witnessing violent deaths\n- military combat\n- being held hostage\n- terrorist attacks\n- natural disasters, such as severe floods, earthquakes or tsunamis\nPTSD&nbsp;can develop immediately&nbsp;after someone experiences a&nbsp;disturbing event or it&nbsp;can occur weeks, months or even years later.\nPTSD is estimated to affect about 1 in every 3 people who have a traumatic experience, but it&#8217;s not clear exactly why some people develop&nbsp;the condition&nbsp;and others don&#8217;t.\nRead more about the causes of PTSD.\nPeople who repeatedly experience traumatic situations such as severe neglect, abuse or violence may be diagnosed with complex PTSD.\nComplex PTSD can cause similar symptoms to PTSD and may not develop until years after the event. It&#8217;s often more severe if the trauma was experienced early in life as this can affect a child&#8217;s development.\nRead more about complex PTSD.\nIt&#8217;s normal to experience upsetting and confusing thoughts after a traumatic event, but most people improve naturally over a few weeks.\nYou should visit your GP if you or your child are still having problems about four weeks after the traumatic experience, or if the symptoms are particularly troublesome.\nIf necessary, your GP can refer you to mental health specialists for further assessment and treatment.\nPTSD can be successfully treated, even when it&nbsp;develops many years after&nbsp;a traumatic event.\nAny treatment depends on the severity of&nbsp;symptoms and how soon they&nbsp;occur after the traumatic event.&nbsp;Any of the following treatment options may be recommended:\n- Watchful waiting – monitoring your&nbsp;symptoms to see whether they improve or get worse without treatment.\n- Psychotherapy – such as trauma-focused&nbsp;cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)&nbsp;or eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR).&nbsp;\n- Antidepressants – such as&nbsp;paroxetine or&nbsp;mirtazapine.\nRead more about treating&nbsp;PTSD.\nThe symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can have a significant impact on your day-to-day life.\nIn most cases, the symptoms develop during the first month after a traumatic event. However, in a minority of cases, there may be a delay of months or even years before symptoms start to appear.\nSome people with PTSD experience long periods when their symptoms are less noticeable, followed by periods where they get worse. Other people have constant, severe symptoms.\nThe specific symptoms of PTSD can vary widely between individuals, but generally fall into the categories described below.\nRe-experiencing is the most&nbsp;typical symptom of PTSD. This is when a person involuntarily and vividly re-lives the traumatic event&nbsp;in the form of:\n- flashbacks\n- nightmares\n- repetitive and distressing images or sensations\n- physical sensations – such as pain, sweating, nausea or trembling\nSome&nbsp;people have&nbsp;constant negative thoughts about their experience, repeatedly asking themselves questions that prevent them from coming to terms with the event.\nFor example, they may wonder why the event happened to them and if they could have done anything to stop it, which can lead to feelings of guilt or shame.\nTrying to avoid being&nbsp;reminded of the traumatic event&nbsp;is another&nbsp;key symptom of PTSD. This usually&nbsp;means avoiding certain people or places that remind you of the trauma, or avoiding talking to anyone about your experience.\nMany people with&nbsp;PTSD try to push memories of the event out of their mind, often distracting themselves with work or hobbies.\nSome people attempt to deal with their feelings by trying not to feel anything at all. This is known as emotional numbing. This can lead to the person becoming isolated and withdrawn, and they may also give up pursuing activities they used to enjoy.\nSomeone with&nbsp;PTSD may be very&nbsp;anxious and find it difficult to relax. They&nbsp;may be constantly aware&nbsp;of threats and easily startled.&nbsp;This state of mind&nbsp;is known as&nbsp;hyperarousal.\nHyperarousal&nbsp;often&nbsp;leads to:\n- irritability\n- angry outbursts\n- sleeping problems (insomnia)\n- difficulty concentrating\nMany people with PTSD also have a number of other problems, including:\n- other mental health problems – such as depression, anxiety&nbsp;or phobias\n- self-harming or destructive behaviour&nbsp;– such as drug misuse&nbsp;or alcohol misuse\n- other physical symptoms – such as headaches, dizziness,&nbsp;chest pains and&nbsp;stomach aches\nPTSD sometimes leads to work-related problems and the breakdown of relationships.\nPTSD&nbsp;can affect children as well as adults. Children with&nbsp;PTSD can have similar symptoms to adults, such as having trouble sleeping and upsetting nightmares.\nLike adults, children with PTSD may also lose interest in activities they used to enjoy and may have physical symptoms such as headaches and stomach aches.\nHowever, there are some symptoms that are more specific to children with PTSD, such as:\n- bedwetting\n- being&nbsp;unusually anxious about being separated from&nbsp;a parent or other adult\n- re-enacting&nbsp;the traumatic event(s) through their play\nIt&#8217;s normal to experience upsetting and confusing thoughts after a traumatic event, but in most people these improve naturally&nbsp;over a few weeks.\nYou should visit your GP if you or your child are still having problems about four weeks after&nbsp;the traumatic experience, or if&nbsp;the symptoms are&nbsp;particularly troublesome.\nYour GP will want to discuss your symptoms with you in as much detail as possible. They&#8217;ll ask whether you&#8217;ve experienced a traumatic event in the recent or distant past and whether you&#8217;ve re-experienced the event through flashbacks or nightmares.\nYour GP can refer you to mental health specialists if they feel you&#8217;d benefit from treatment. See&nbsp;treating PTSD for more information.\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can develop after a very stressful, frightening or distressing event, or after a prolonged traumatic experience.\nTypes of events that can lead to PTSD include:\n- serious road accidents\n- violent personal assaults, such as sexual assault, mugging or robbery\n- prolonged sexual abuse, violence or severe neglect\n- witnessing violent deaths\n- military combat\n- being held hostage\n- terrorist attacks\n- natural disasters, such as severe floods, earthquakes or tsunamis\n- a diagnosis of a life-threatening condition\n- an unexpected severe injury or death of a close family member&nbsp;or friend\nPTSD&nbsp;isn&#8217;t usually related to&nbsp;situations that are simply upsetting, such as divorce, job loss or failing exams.\nPTSD develops in about 1 in 3 people who experience severe trauma. It isn&#8217;t fully understood why some people develop the condition while others don&#8217;t. However, certain factors appear to make some people more likely to develop PTSD.\nIf you&#8217;ve had&nbsp;depression or&nbsp;anxiety in the past, or you don&#8217;t receive much support from family or friends, you&#8217;re more susceptible to developing PTSD after a traumatic event.\nThere may also be a genetic factor involved in PTSD. For example, having a parent with a mental health problem&nbsp;is thought to increase your chances of developing the condition.\nAlthough it&#8217;s not clear exactly why people develop PTSD, a number of possible reasons have been suggested. These are described below.\nOne suggestion is that the symptoms of PTSD are the result of an instinctive&nbsp;mechanism&nbsp;intended to&nbsp;help you survive further traumatic experiences.\nFor example, the flashbacks many people with PTSD experience may force you to think about the event in detail so you&#8217;re better prepared if it happens again. The feeling of being &#8220;on edge&#8221; (hyperarousal) may develop to help you react quickly in another crisis.\nHowever, while&nbsp;these responses may be intended to help you survive, they&#8217;re actually very unhelpful in reality because you can&#8217;t process and move on from&nbsp;the traumatic experience.\nStudies have shown that people with PTSD have abnormal levels of stress hormones.\nNormally, when in danger,&nbsp;the body produces stress hormones such as adrenaline to&nbsp;trigger a reaction in the body. This reaction,&nbsp;often known as the &#8220;fight or flight&#8221; reaction, helps to deaden the senses and dull pain.\nPeople with PTSD have been found to continue to produce high amounts of fight or flight hormones even when there&#8217;s no danger. It&#8217;s thought this may be responsible for the numbed emotions and hyperarousal experienced by some people with PTSD.\nIn people with PTSD, parts of the brain involved in emotional processing appear different in brain scans.\nOne part of the brain responsible for memory and emotions is known as the hippocampus. In people with PTSD, the hippocampus appears smaller in size. It&#8217;s thought that&nbsp;changes in this part of the brain may be related to fear and anxiety, memory problems and flashbacks.\nThe malfunctioning hippocampus may prevent flashbacks and nightmares from being properly processed, so the anxiety they generate doesn&#8217;t reduce over time.\nTreatment of PTSD results in proper processing of the memories so, over time, the flashbacks and nightmares gradually disappear.\nThe main treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are psychotherapy and medication.\nTraumatic&nbsp;events can be very difficult to come to terms with, but confronting your feelings and seeking professional help is often the only way of effectively treating PTSD.\nIt&#8217;s possible for PTSD to be&nbsp;successfully treated many years after the traumatic event occurred, which means it&#8217;s never too late to seek help.\nBefore having treatment for&nbsp;PTSD, a detailed assessment of your symptoms will be carried out to ensure treatment is tailored to your individual needs.\nYour GP will often carry out an initial assessment, but you&#8217;ll be referred to a mental health specialist for further assessment and treatment&nbsp;if&nbsp;you&#8217;ve had symptoms of PTSD for more than four weeks or your symptoms are severe.\nThere are a number of mental health specialists you may see if you have PTSD, such as:\n- a psychologist – an expert in how the mind works\n- a community psychiatric nurse – a nurse who specialises in mental healthcare\n- a psychiatrist – a mental health specialist who diagnoses and treats mental health conditions\nIf you have mild symptoms of PTSD, or you&#8217;ve had symptoms for less than four weeks, an approach called watchful waiting may be recommended.\nWatchful waiting involves carefully monitoring your symptoms to see whether they improve or get worse. It&#8217;s&nbsp;sometimes recommended because 2 in every 3 people who&nbsp;develop problems after a traumatic experience get better within a few weeks without treatment.\nIf watchful waiting is recommended, you should have a follow-up appointment within one month.\nIf you have PTSD that requires treatment, psychotherapy&nbsp;is usually recommended first. A combination of&nbsp;psychotherapy and medication may be recommended&nbsp;if you have severe or persistent PTSD.\nPsychotherapy&nbsp;is a type of therapy often&nbsp;used to&nbsp;treat emotional problems and mental health conditions such as PTSD, depression, anxiety&nbsp;and obsessive compulsive disorder.\nThe treatment&nbsp;is carried out by&nbsp;trained mental health professionals who listen to you and help&nbsp;you come up&nbsp;with effective strategies to resolve your problems.\nThe main types of psychotherapy used to treat people with PTSD are described below.\nCognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a type of therapy that aims to help you manage your problems by changing how you think and act.\nTrauma-focused CBT uses a range of psychological treatment techniques to help you come to terms with the traumatic event.\nFor example, your therapist may ask you to confront your traumatic memories by thinking about your experience in detail. During this process your therapist helps you cope with any distress you&nbsp;feel, while&nbsp;identifying any unhelpful thoughts or misrepresentations you have about the experience.\nYour therapist can help you gain control of your fear and distress by changing the negative way you think about your experience. For example,&nbsp;feeling&nbsp;you&#8217;re&nbsp;to blame for what happened or fear that it may happen again.\nYou may also be encouraged to gradually restart any activities you&#8217;ve avoided since your experience, such as driving a car if you had an accident.\nYou&#8217;ll usually have&nbsp;8-12 weekly sessions of trauma-focused CBT, although fewer may be needed. Sessions usually last for around 60-90 minutes.\nEye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) is a relatively new treatment which has been found to reduce the symptoms of PTSD.\nIt involves making side-to-side eye movements, usually by following the movement of your therapist&#8217;s finger, while recalling the traumatic incident.&nbsp;Other methods&nbsp;may include&nbsp;the therapist tapping their finger or playing a tone.\nIt&#8217;s not clear exactly how EMDR works&nbsp;but it may help you to change the negative way you think about a traumatic experience.\nYou may also be offered group therapy as some people find it helpful&nbsp;to speak about their experiences with other people&nbsp;who also have PTSD. Group therapy can be used to teach you ways to manage your symptoms and help you understand the condition.\nThere are also a number of charities&nbsp;which provide&nbsp;counselling and support groups for PTSD. For example:\n- Combat Stress&nbsp;– a military charity specialising in helping ex-servicemen and women\n- Rape Crisis&nbsp;– a charity providing a range of services for women and girls who have experienced abuse, domestic violence and sexual assault\n- Victim Support – providing support and information to victims or witnesses of crime\n- CRUSE&nbsp;– a UK charity providing support and information for people who have experienced bereavement\nAntidepressants such as&nbsp;paroxetine, sertraline, mirtazapine, amitriptyline or phenelzine&nbsp;are sometimes used to treat PTSD in adults.\nOf these medications, paroxetine and sertraline are the only ones licensed specifically for the treatment of PTSD. However, mirtazapine, amitriptyline and phenelzine have also been found to be effective and may be&nbsp;recommended as well.\nHowever, these&nbsp;medications will only be used if:\n- you choose not to have trauma-focused psychological treatment\n- psychological treatment wouldn&#8217;t be effective because there&#8217;s an ongoing threat of further trauma (such as domestic violence)\n- you&#8217;ve gained little or no benefit from a course of trauma-focused psychological treatment\n- you have an underlying medical condition, such as severe depression, that significantly affects your ability to benefit from psychological treatment\nAmitriptyline or phenelzine will usually only be used under the supervision of a mental health specialist.\nAntidepressants&nbsp;can also be prescribed to reduce any associated symptoms of depression and anxiety and to help with sleeping problems. However,&nbsp;they&#8217;re not usually prescribed&nbsp;for people younger than&nbsp;18 unless recommended by a specialist.\nIf medication for PTSD is effective, it&#8217;s usually be continued for a minimum of 12 months before being gradually withdrawn over the course of four weeks or longer. If a medication&nbsp;isn&#8217;t effective at reducing your symptoms,&nbsp;your dosage may be increased.\nBefore prescribing a medication, your doctor should inform you about possible side effects you may have while taking it, along with any possible withdrawal symptoms when the medication is withdrawn.\nFor example, common&nbsp;side effects of paroxetine include feeling sick, blurred vision, constipation and diarrhoea.\nPossible withdrawal symptoms associated with paroxetine include sleep disturbances, intense dreams, anxiety and irritability. Withdrawal symptoms are less likely if the medication is reduced slowly.\nFor&nbsp;children and young people with PTSD, trauma-focused CBT is usually recommended.\nThis normally involves&nbsp;a course of 8-12 sessions that have been adapted to suit the child’s age, circumstances and level of development. Where appropriate, treatment includes consulting with and involving the child&#8217;s&nbsp;family.\nTreatment with medication isn&#8217;t usually recommended for children and young people with PTSD.\nComplex PTSD may be diagnosed in adults or children who have repeatedly experienced traumatic events, such as violence, neglect or abuse.\nComplex PTSD is thought to be more severe if:\n- the traumatic events happened early in life\n- the trauma was caused by a parent or carer\n- the person experienced the trauma for a long time\n- the person was alone during the trauma\n- there is still contact with the person responsible for the trauma\nAs&nbsp;it&nbsp;may take years for the symptoms of complex PTSD to be recognised,&nbsp;a child&#8217;s&nbsp;development, including their behaviour and self-confidence, can be altered as they get older.\nAdults with complex PTSD may lose their trust in people and feel separated from others.\nThe symptoms of complex PTSD are similar to symptoms of PTSD&nbsp;but may include:\n- feelings of shame or guilt\n- difficulty controlling your emotions\n- periods of losing attention and concentration – this is known as dissociation\n- physical symptoms – such as headaches, dizziness, chest pains and stomach aches\n- cutting yourself off from friends and family\n- relationship difficulties\n- destructive or risky behaviour – such as self-harm,&nbsp;alcohol misuse or drug abuse\n- suicidal&nbsp;thoughts\nOne of the key symptoms of complex PTSD is losing trust in people. If possible, people with complex PTSD are recommended to slowly start doing regular activities such as:\n- finding friends\n- getting a job\n- regular exercise\n- taking on hobbies\nIt&#8217;s important to try and develop some feelings of trust.&nbsp;It may take some time, but a&nbsp;trusting relationship with a therapist&nbsp;will help&nbsp;treat complex PTSD.\nTreatment from a therapist may be given in three stages, described below.\nOne of the first steps in treating complex PTSD may involve speaking with a therapist to learn how to control feelings of distrust and lose the feeling of being &#8216;disconnected&#8217; from friends and family.\nCertain techniques, known as &#8216;grounding&#8217; techniques, may be able to help you separate an abusive or traumatic past from the present. The aim is to make the past seem less frightening and reduce the amount of flashbacks you experience.\nWith time, you can begin to experience less anxiety and learn to cope with daily life.\nTrauma-focused therapy&nbsp;may include:\n- certain types of psychotherapy\n- cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)\n- eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR)\nThese treatments may help you to control any distressing thoughts but must be approached carefully to avoid making the situation worse.\nThe final stage is to begin to use these skills and techniques to&nbsp;develop better relationships with other people.\nMedication, such as antidepressants, may still be recommended if psychotherapy isn&#8217;t possible or you feel unsafe.\nYou can read more information about complex PTSD on the Royal College of Psychiatrists website.\nIf you think you’re experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD), it’s important for you to visit your GP and discuss your concerns. The PTSD and CPTSD self-help guide can help with managing symptoms while you wait for an assessment by your GP or a mental health professional.\nThis guide aims to help you:\n- consider whether you’re experiencing symptoms of PTSD or CPTSD\n- understand more about PTSD and&nbsp;CPTSD\n- think about ways to manage or recover from PTSD or CPTSD\nThe PTSD and CPTSD self-help guide is based on Trauma-Focused Cognitive Therapy (TF-CT). TF-CT aims to help people who have been through trauma and adversity to make sense of what they’ve experienced, and become less distressed and affected by it.\nWork through a self-help guide for PTSD and CPTSD based on Trauma-Focused Cognitive Therapy (TF-CT)."

        "disease": "Postnatal depression",
        "description": "Postnatal depression is a type of depression. Many parents experience it after having a baby.\nIt&#8217;s a common problem, affecting more than 1 in every 10 mothers within a year of giving birth. It can also affect fathers and partners, although this is less common.\nWith the right support, which can include self-help strategies and therapy, most people make a full recovery.\nPostnatal depression affects everyone differently. It can start at any point in the first year after giving birth. It can continue from depression in pregnancy. It may develop suddenly or gradually.\nMany people feel a bit down, tearful or anxious in the first week after giving birth. This is often called the &#8216;baby blues&#8217; and is so common that it’s considered normal. The baby blues don’t last for more than 2 weeks after giving birth.\nIf your symptoms last longer or start later, you could have postnatal depression.\nThe main symptoms of postnatal depression include:\n- a persistent feeling of sadness and low mood\n- loss of interest in the world around you\n- no longer enjoying things that used to give you pleasure\n- lack of energy and feeling tired all the time\n- trouble sleeping at night\n- feeling sleepy during the day\n- feeling that you&#8217;re unable to look after your baby\n- problems concentrating and making decisions\n- loss of appetite or an increased appetite (comfort eating)\n- feeling agitated, irritable or very apathetic (you &#8216;can&#8217;t be bothered&#8217;)\n- feelings of guilt, hopelessness and self-blame\n- difficulty bonding with your baby &#8211; feeling of indifference and no sense of enjoyment in their company\n- frightening thoughts, for example, about hurting your baby &#8211; these can be scary, but they&#8217;re very rarely acted upon\n- thinking about suicide and self-harm\nThese symptoms can affect your day-to-day life and your relationships with your baby, family and friends.\nDon&#8217;t struggle on alone and hope the problem will go away. It can take a lot longer to feel better if it&#8217;s not addressed.\nPostnatal depression can develop gradually and it can be hard to recognise. Some parents may avoid talking to family and friends about how they’re feeling. This may be because they worry they’ll be judged for not coping or not appearing happy.\nSigns for partners, family and friends to look out for in new parents include:\n- frequently crying for no obvious reason\n- having difficulty bonding with their baby\n- getting no pleasure from playing with them or feeling no good as a parent\n- withdrawing from contact with other people\n- speaking negatively all the time and claiming that they&#8217;re hopeless\n- neglecting themselves, like not washing or changing their clothes\n- losing all sense of time, like being unaware whether 10 minutes or 2 hours have passed\n- losing their sense of humour\n- constantly worrying that something is wrong with their baby, regardless of reassurance from others\nIf you think someone you know is depressed, encourage them to talk about their feelings. This could be to talk to you, a friend, their GP or their health visitor.\nThe cause of postnatal depression isn&#8217;t completely clear. Some of the factors it has been associated with include:\n- a history of mental health problems, particularly depression, earlier in life or during pregnancy\n- having no close family or friends to support you\n- a poor relationship with your partner\n- recent stressful life events, like a bereavement\n- experiencing the &#8216;baby blues&#8217;\nEven if you don&#8217;t have any of these symptoms, having a baby is a life-changing event that can sometimes trigger depression.\nIt often takes time to adapt to becoming a new parent. Looking after a small baby can be stressful and exhausting.\nPostnatal depression can be lonely, distressing and frightening. But, support and treatments are available. With the right treatment and support, most people make a full recovery, although it can take time.\nTalk to your GP about the pros and cons of different treatments so you can decide together what’s best for you.\nYour GP might also want to check your physical health to see if there are any problems that may need to be addressed as well. For example, you may be anaemic after giving birth. This could add to any feelings of depression you might have.\nPsychological therapies are usually the first treatment recommended for postnatal depression.\nGuided self-help involves working through a book or an online course. You can do this on your own or with some help from a therapist.\nIt focusses on the issues you might be facing, with practical advice on how to deal with them.\nThe courses typically last 9 to 12 weeks.\nCognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a type of talking therapy. It&#8217;s based on the idea that unhelpful and unrealistic thinking leads to negative behaviour.\nCBT aims to break this cycle and find new ways of thinking that can help you behave in a more positive way.\nCBT can be carried out either one-to-one with a therapist or in a group. Treatment will often last 3 to 4 months.\nInterpersonal therapy (IPT) involves talking to a therapist about the problems you&#8217;re experiencing.\nIt aims to identify problems in your relationships with family, friends or partners. It then looks at how they might relate to your feelings of depression.\nTreatment also usually lasts 3 to 4 months.\nAntidepressants may be recommended if:\n- you have moderate or severe depression\n- you don&#8217;t want to try psychological treatment\n- psychological treatment doesn&#8217;t help\n- you have mild postnatal depression and a previous history of depression\nThey can help ease symptoms like:\n- low mood\n- irritability\n- lack of concentration\n- sleeplessness\nThis helps you to function normally and helps you cope better with your new baby.\nAntidepressants usually need to be taken for at least a week before the benefit starts to be felt. This means it&#8217;s important to keep taking them even if you don&#8217;t notice an improvement straight away. You&#8217;ll usually need to take them for around 6 months after you begin to feel better. If you stop too early, your depression may return.\nIf you&rsquo;re breastfeeding, talk to your doctor about suitable medicines. Some types of antidepressants are safe to take while breastfeeding.Your doctor should explain any risks of taking antidepressants. You should be offered the type with the least risk for you and your baby.\nThere are many things you can try yourself to improve your symptoms and help you cope.\nAsk your health visitor about support services in your area. They may be able to put you in touch with a social worker, counsellor or local support group. It can be reassuring to meet other people who are going through something similar.\nFind postnatal depression support and information in your area\nYou might be referred to a specialist perinatal mental health team if your depression:\n- is very severe\n- doesn&#8217;t respond to treatment like antidepressants, self-help or therapy\nYour team might be able to offer other treatments, like:\n- more intensive CBT\n- other psychological treatments, like psychotherapy\n- therapies such as baby massage which can improve depression and help build your relationships with your baby\n- different medications\n- electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) where electrodes are placed on your head and pulses of electricity are sent through the brain\nFor a small number of people, coming into hospital can help speed up recovery.\nYou may be offered a place in a Mother and Baby Unit, where you can continue to look after your baby while you get the best treatment for your illness."

        "disease": "Pressure ulcers",
        "description": "Pressure ulcers (pressure sores or bed sores) are areas of damage to your skin and the tissue underneath. They&#8217;re caused when an area of skin is put under pressure.\nYou&#8217;re more likely to get them if you have difficulty moving. Especially if you are confined to lying in a bed or sitting for long periods of time.\nPressure ulcers usually form on bony parts of the body that aren&#8217;t covered with much body fat. This includes areas such as the heels, elbows, hips and tailbone.\nSymptoms include patches of skin that:\n- are discoloured and don&#8217;t change colour when pressed – the patches are usually red on white skin, or purple or blue on black or brown skin\n- feel warm, spongy or hard\n- become painful or itchy\nPressure ulcers usually come on gradually, but sometimes appear quite quickly.\nSometimes they can blister or become an open wound. If it&#8217;s not treated it will continue to get worse, and might deepen to reach muscle or bone.\nYou or someone you care for have symptoms of a pressure ulcer and:\nHealthcare professionals use several grading systems to describe how severe your pressure ulcers are. The most common is the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP) grading system. The higher the grade, the more severe the injury.\nA grade 1 pressure ulcer is the least severe type of ulcer. The affected area of skin is discoloured. Grade 1 pressure ulcers don&#8217;t turn white when they&#8217;re pressed. There&#8217;s no open wound, but it may hurt or itch. It may also feel either warm and spongy, or hard.\nIn grade 2 pressure ulcers, some of the outer surface of the skin (the epidermis) or the deeper layer of skin (the dermis) is damaged. This can lead to loss of skin. The ulcer looks like an open wound or a blister.\nIn grade 3 pressure ulcers, skin loss occurs throughout the entire thickness of the skin. The underlying tissue is also damaged, but the underlying muscle and bone aren&#8217;t. The ulcer appears as a deep wound.\nA grade 4 pressure ulcer is the most severe type of pressure ulcer. The skin is severely damaged and the surrounding tissue begins to die (tissue necrosis). The underlying muscles or bone may also be damaged.\nPeople with grade 4 pressure ulcers have a high risk of developing a life-threatening infection.\nPressure ulcers are easily diagnosed by looking at them. However, it&#8217;s better to prevent ulcers from developing first. It’s important to assess a person’s risk of developing them.\nAs part of the risk assessment process, your healthcare professional may consider:\n- your general health\n- your ability to move\n- whether you have any problems that affect your posture\n- whether you have any symptoms that indicate an infection\n- your mental health\n- whether you&#8217;ve had pressure ulcers in the past\n- whether you have urinary incontinence or bowel incontinence\n- your diet\n- how well your blood circulation system is working\nAs part of the risk assessment, you may be referred for a:\n- blood test – to assess your health and if your diet gives you the nutrition you need\n- urine test – to check how well your kidneys are working and whether you have a urinary tract infection\nIf you&#8217;re at risk of pressure ulcers, you can look out for areas of discolouration and patches of skin that feel unusually spongy or tough to the touch. Use a mirror to check parts of your body that can be difficult to see, such as your back or buttocks. Contact your GP or your healthcare team if you notice any signs of damage.\nThe type of treatment you get will depend on how severe the pressure ulcer is.\nChanging position and moving regularly is important to help relieve pressure on the ulcers and help stop new ones forming.\nOther treatments include:\n- specially designed mattresses and cushions\n- dressings to protect the ulcer and help it heal\n- creams and ointments\n- antibiotics if the ulcer is infected\n- cleaning the ulcer\nIf the pressure ulcer is severe or other treatments have not worked, you may need to have surgery to clean and close the ulcer.\nPressure ulcers are caused by something putting pressure on or rubbing your skin, such as a bed or a wheelchair.\nIt can happen to anyone, but it&#8217;s usually if you have problems moving, as this can mean the weight of your body is always putting pressure on the same areas of skin, which can damage it.\nYou have a higher chance of getting a pressure ulcer if you:\n- have problems moving\n- have had a pressure ulcer before\n- have been seriously ill in intensive care or have recently had surgery\n- are underweight\n- have swollen, sweaty or broken skin\n- have poor circulation or fragile skin\n- have problems feeling sensation or pain\nThere are things that can help lower your chances of getting a pressure ulcer.\nEven with medical care, there can be complications with a grade 3 or grade 4 pressure ulcer. This can occasionally be life-threatening.\nComplications of pressure ulcers include:\n- cellulitis – an infection that can spread from the site of the pressure ulcer to a deeper layer of skin\n- blood poisoning – an infection that can spread from the pressure ulcer into the bloodstream and other organs\n- bone and joint infection\n- necrotising fasciitis – a serious skin infection that causes rapid tissue death\n- gas gangrene – a serious but rare form of infection that occurs when a pressure ulcer becomes infected with clostridium bacteria"

        "disease": "Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)",
        "description": "Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a neurological condition. It&#8217;s caused by the loss of nerve cells in parts of the brain. This can lead to problems with balance, movement, vision, speech and swallowing.\nPSP usually develops gradually and can sometimes be mistaken for other conditions. The symptoms tend to get worse over many years.\nThe first symptoms of PSP you might experience include:\n- repeated falls (often backwards) caused by a sudden loss of balance when walking\n- muscle stiffness, especially in the neck\n- fatigue\n- changes in personality like mood swings and irritability\n- changes in behaviour like recklessness and poor judgement\n- dislike of bright lights (photophobia)\n- eye problems like blurred or double vision, problems looking up and down, or involuntary eye closure\n- tremors (involuntary shaking of parts of the body)\n- slow movement\nThe symptoms of PSP, like balance and mobility problems, are likely to progressively get worse.\nThe new symptoms that might develop at this stage include:\n- slurred, slow or quiet speech\n- problems with swallowing (dysphagia)\n- involuntary blinking or twitching of the eyelids\n- reduced blinking reflex which causes the eyes to become dry and irritated\n- problems sleeping\n- memory problems\n- slowness of thought\n- back, neck and joint pain\nAs the symptoms of PSP get worse, your speech might become slower and more slurred.\nMobility problems might get worse and you might need a wheelchair to help you get around.\nAt the advanced stage, people with PSP are likely to have difficulty controlling the muscles of their mouth, tongue and throat.\nSwallowing problems can become worse because of the loss of control of the throat muscles.\nPSP can cause problems like constipation and difficulty passing urine (peeing). It can also cause frequent peeing during the night. Sometimes it can cause you to lose control of your bowel and bladder movements (incontinence).\nIt&#8217;s believed that a protein called tau, which builds up in certain areas of the brain, forms into clumps. This causes damage to the nerve cells. Over time this build up can lead to someone experiencing the symptoms of PSP.\nThe location of the clumps and the amount of tau varies between people with PSP. This also affects the type and severity of symptoms.\nPSP tends not to run in families and is not believed to be hereditary in most cases.\nThere&#8217;s no single test for PSP. The many different symptoms can make it difficult to diagnose.\nA specialist doctor will ask you about your symptoms to rule out other similar conditions, like Parkinson&#8217;s disease.\nYou might have other tests and scans.\nYou might have:\n- an&nbsp;MRI scan\n- a dopamine SPECT scan which involves an injection of radioactive material to allow a gamma camera to create picture of the brain\nThe scans will also help to rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms.\nYou might have neuropsychological testing to evaluate your symptoms.\nThese tests will assess your:\n- concentration\n- memory\n- communication\n- ability to process visual information like pictures and words\nAlthough there&#8217;s no cure for PSP, there are lots of ways you can manage your symptoms.\nIt&#8217;s likely you&#8217;ll have a multi disciplinary team (MDT) who&#8217;ll work together to help manage your symptoms.\nVisit the PSP Association for information and support about living with PSP. They have a dedicated PSP Care Navigator who can help to support you.\nThere&#8217;s no specific medication that can treat PSP. Taking medication used to treat Parkinson&#8217;s disease can help some people with PSP. This can help to improve stiffness, movement and balance for some people. The effect, however, is sometimes limited and might only last a few years.\nSome antidepressants can help improve problems with pain, stiffness and sleep problems. You might be offered antidepressants to help with depression.\nYou should discuss your symptoms with your doctor to make sure you&#8217;re prescribed the best treatment.\nA physiotherapist can give you regular exercises to do. This can help strengthen your muscles and prevent your joints from stiffening.\nThey&#8217;ll also consider if there&#8217;s any equipment that would help you. You might try a walking frame or shoes that can help reduce your risk of falls.\nYou can try breathing exercises to reduce the chance of developing aspiration pneumonia when you eat. Aspiration pneumonia is a chest infection caused by inhaling particles of food into your lungs.\nA speech and language therapist will try to help with your problems with speech and swallowing (dysphagia).\nThey might suggest changing the consistency of your food to make it easier to swallow.\nThey might be able to give you techniques you can use to make your voice clearer. They&#8217;ll suggest communication aids or devices if they think they might help you.\nA dietitian will talk to you about how to eat a healthy balanced diet. They can help you include more food and liquids that are easy to swallow.\nIf there&#8217;s a risk of malnutrition and dehydration, you might be offered a feeding tube.\nAn occupational therapist will assess your home for hazards that could cause you to fall and injure yourself.

        "disease": "Prostate cancer",
        "description": "Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and anyone with a prostate in the UK.\nProstate cancer usually develops slowly, so there may be no signs you have it for many years.\nSymptoms often only become apparent when your prostate is large enough to affect the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the penis).\nWhen this happens, you may notice things like an increased need to urinate, straining while urinating and a feeling that your bladder has not fully emptied.\nThese symptoms shouldn’t be ignored, but they do not mean you definitely have prostate cancer. It is more likely that they are caused by something else, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (also known as BPH or prostate enlargement).\nRead more about the symptoms of&nbsp;prostate cancer\nThe prostate is a small gland in the pelvis. About the size of a satsuma, it&#8217;s located between the penis and the bladder and&nbsp;surrounds the urethra.\nThe main function of the prostate is to help in the production of semen. It produces a thick white fluid that is mixed with the sperm produced by the testicles, to create semen.\nThe causes of prostate cancer are largely unknown. However, certain things&nbsp;can increase your risk of developing the condition.\nThe chances of developing prostate cancer increase as you get older. Most cases develop in men and anyone with a prostate aged 50 or older.\nFor reasons not yet understood, prostate cancer is more common in men and anyone with a prostate of African-Caribbean African descent. It&#8217;s less common in men and anyone with a prostate of Asian descent.\nMen and anyone with a prostate who have&nbsp;first-degree&nbsp;male relatives (such as a father or brother) affected by prostate cancer are also at a slightly increased risk.\nRead more about the causes of prostate cancer\nThere is no single test for prostate cancer. All the tests used to help diagnose the condition have benefits and risks, which your doctor should discuss with you.\nThe most commonly used tests for prostate cancer are blood tests, a physical examination of your prostate (known as a digital rectal examination or DRE) and a biopsy.\nThe blood test, known as a&nbsp;prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, measures the level of PSA and may help detect early prostate cancer. Men and anyone with a prostate are not routinely offered PSA tests to screen for prostate cancer, as results can be unreliable.\nThis is because the PSA blood test is not specific to prostate cancer. PSA can be raised due to a large non-cancerous growth of the prostate (BPH), a urinary tract infection or inflammation of the prostate, as well as prostate cancer. Raised PSA levels also cannot tell a doctor whether a man has life-threatening prostate cancer or not. This means a raised PSA can lead to unnecessary tests and treatment.\nHowever, you can ask to be tested for prostate cancer once the benefits and risks have been explained to you.\nRead more about&nbsp;diagnosing prostate cancer and PSA screening for prostate cancer\nIn many cases,&nbsp;treatment is not immediately necessary.\nIf the cancer is at an early stage and&nbsp;not causing symptoms, a policy of &#8216;watchful waiting&#8217; or &#8216;active surveillance&#8217; may be adopted. This involves carefully monitoring your condition.\nSome cases of prostate cancer can be cured if treated in the early stages. Treatments include surgically removing the prostate, radiotherapy and hormone therapy.\nSome cases are only diagnosed at a later stage when the cancer has spread. If the cancer spreads to other parts of the body, typically the bones, it cannot be cured and treatment is focused on prolonging life and relieving symptoms.\nAll treatment options carry the risk of significant side effects, including erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence. For this reason, many people choose to delay treatment until there is a risk the cancer might spread.\nNewer treatments,&nbsp;such as&nbsp;high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)&nbsp;or cryotherapy, aim to reduce these side effects.&nbsp;Some hospitals may offer them as an alternative to surgery, radiotherapy or hormone therapy. However, the long-term effectiveness of these treatments are not yet known.\nRead more about treating prostate cancer\nAs&nbsp;prostate cancer usually progresses very slowly, you can live for decades without symptoms or needing treatment.\nNevertheless, it can have an effect on your life. As well as causing physical problems such as erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence, a diagnosis of prostate cancer can understandably make you feel anxious or depressed.\nYou may find it beneficial to talk about the condition with your family, friends, a family doctor and other people with prostate cancer.\nFinancial support is also available if prostate cancer reduces your ability to work.\nRead more about living with prostate cancer\nProstate cancer does not normally cause symptoms until the cancer has grown large enough to put pressure on the urethra.\nThis normally results in problems associated with urination. Symptoms can include:\n- needing to urinate more frequently, often during the night\n- needing to rush to the toilet\n- difficulty in starting to pee (hesitancy)\n- straining or taking a long time while urinating\n- weak flow\n- feeling that your bladder has not emptied fully\nYour prostate may&nbsp;get larger as you get older due to a non-cancerous condition known as prostate enlargement or benign prostatic hyperplasia.\nSymptoms that the cancer may have spread include bone and back pain, a loss of appetite, pain in the testicles and unexplained weight loss.\nRead further information:\n- Cancer Research UK: prostate cancer symptoms\nIt&#8217;s not known exactly what causes prostate cancer, although a number of things can increase your risk of developing the condition.\nThese include:\n- age – risk&nbsp;rises as you get older and&nbsp;most cases are diagnosed in&nbsp;men and anyone with a prostate over 50 years of age\n- ethnic group – prostate cancer is more common among men and anyone with a prostate of African-Caribbean and African descent than&nbsp;in men and anyone with a prostate of Asian descent\n- family history – having a brother or father who developed prostate cancer under the age of 60 seems to increase the risk of you developing it; having a close female relative who developed breast cancer may also increase your risk of developing&nbsp;prostate cancer\n- obesity – there may be a link between obesity and prostate cancer\n- exercise – men and anyone with a prostate who regularly exercises have also been found to be at lower risk of developing prostate cancer\n- diet – research is ongoing into the links between diet and prostate cancer; a diet high in calcium is linked to an increased risk of developing prostate cancer\nIn addition, some research has shown that prostate cancer rates appear to be lower in&nbsp;men and anyone with a prostate who eat foods containing certain nutrients including lycopene, found in cooked tomatoes and other red fruit, and selenium, found in brazil nuts. However, more research is needed.\nRead further information:\n- Prostate Cancer UK: who is at risk of prostate cancer\n- Cancer Research UK: prostate cancer risks and causes\nIf you have symptoms that could be caused by prostate cancer, you should visit your GP.\nThere is no single, definitive test for prostate cancer, so your GP&nbsp;will discuss the pros and cons of the various tests with you to try to avoid unnecessary anxiety.\nYour doctor is likely to:\n- ask for a urine sample to check for infection\n- take a&nbsp;blood sample to test your level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)\n- examine your prostate (digital rectal examination)\nIn 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of prostate cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected prostate cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral.\nPSA is a protein produced by the prostate gland. All men and anyone with a prostate have a small amount of PSA in their blood, and it increases with age.\nProstate cancer can increase the production of PSA, and so a PSA test looks for raised levels of PSA in the blood that may&nbsp;be a sign of the condition&nbsp;in its early stages.\nHowever, PSA testing is not a specific test for prostate cancer. Most men and anyone with a prostate who has prostate cancer will not have a raised PSA level. Most people&nbsp;with a raised PSA level will not have cancer, as PSA levels rise in all men and anyone with a prostate as they get older.\nRead more about PSA screening for prostate cancer\nThe next step is a DRE, which can be done by your GP.\nDuring a DRE, your GP will insert a lubricated and gloved finger into your rectum. The rectum is close to your prostate gland, so your GP can check to feel if the surface of the gland has changed. This will feel a little uncomfortable, but should not be painful.\nProstate cancer can make the gland&nbsp;hard and bumpy. However, in most cases, the cancer causes no changes to the gland and a DRE may not be able to detect the cancer.\nDRE is useful in ruling out&nbsp;prostate enlargement caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia, as this causes the gland to feel firm and smooth.\nYour GP will assess your risk of having prostate cancer based on a number of factors, including your PSA levels, the results of your DRE, and your age, family history and ethnic group. If you are at risk, you&nbsp;should be referred to hospital to discuss the options of further tests.\nThe most commonly used test is a transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy (TRUS). A biopsy may also be taken during a cystoscopy examination or through the skin behind the testicles (perineum).\nDuring a TRUS biopsy, an ultrasound probe (a machine that uses sound waves to build a picture of the inside of your body) is inserted into your rectum. This allows the doctor or specialist nurse to see exactly where to pass a needle through the wall of your rectum to take small samples of tissue from your prostate.\nThe procedure can be uncomfortable and sometimes painful, so you may be given a local anaesthetic to minimise any discomfort. As with any procedure, there may be complications, including bleeding and infection.\nAlthough it is more reliable than a PSA test, the TRUS biopsy&nbsp;can have&nbsp;problems. It can miss up to 1 in 5 cancers, because the location of the cancer is unknown when it is carried out. The doctors can see the prostate using the ultrasound scan, but not the tumour(s) if they are present.\nYou may need another biopsy if your symptoms persist, or your PSA level continues to rise. Your doctor may&nbsp;request an MRI scan of the prostate before another biopsy.\nThe TRUS biopsy can also find small low-risk cancers that do not need treatment, but may cause you anxiety. Many people often choose to undergo surgery or radiotherapy that may not benefit them but causes side effects, such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction.\nThe samples of tissue from the biopsy are studied in a laboratory. If cancerous cells are found, they can be studied further to see how quickly the cancer will spread. This process is known as &#8216;staging and grading&#8217; and helps doctors to decide which treatment is the most appropriate.\nRead further information:\n- Cancer Research UK: The stages of prostate cancer\n- Macmillan: Grading and staging of prostate cancer\nIf there is a significant chance&nbsp;the cancer has spread from your prostate to other parts of the body, further tests may be recommended.\nThese include:\n- a&nbsp;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerised tomography (CT) scan – these scans build a detailed picture of the inside of your body\n- an isotope bone scan – this can tell if the cancer has spread to your bones; a small amount of radiation dye is injected into the vein and&nbsp;collects in parts of the bone where there are any abnormalities\nRead further information:\n- Cancer Research UK: Prostate cancer tests\nThere is currently no screening programme for prostate cancer in the UK. This is because it has not been proved that the benefits would outweigh the risks.\nRoutinely screening all men and anyone with a prostate to check their prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels is a controversial subject in the international medical community. There are several reasons for this:\n- PSA tests are unreliable and can suggest prostate cancer when no cancer exists (a false-positive result) – this means that many men often have invasive and sometimes painful biopsies for no reason\n- the PSA test can find aggressive prostate cancer that needs treatment, but it can also find slow-growing cancer that may never cause symptoms or shorten life&nbsp;–&nbsp;some men and anyone with a prostate may therefore face difficult decisions about treatment\n- treating prostate cancer in its early stages can be beneficial in some cases but the&nbsp;side effects of the various treatments are potentially so serious that men may choose to delay treatment until it is absolutely necessary\n- although screening has been shown to reduce a man&#8217;s chance of dying from prostate cancer, it would mean many people receive treatment unnecessarily\nMore research is needed to determine whether a screening programme would provide men and anyone with a prostate with more benefit than harm.\nOne European study showed deaths from prostate cancer could be reduced by 20% if there was a screening programme, but this needs to be balanced against the harms of:\n- overdiagnosis –&nbsp;people being diagnosed with a cancer&nbsp;that will never cause symptoms or death during their lifetime&nbsp;\n- overtreatment –&nbsp;people being treated unnecessarily for tumours that would be&nbsp;unlikely to&nbsp;be harmful&nbsp;&nbsp;\nAs there are many reasons why PSA levels may be high at any one time, researchers are trying to make the PSA test, or a variation of it, more accurate. This includes looking at how PSA levels change over time and comparing the PSA level to prostate size.\nResearchers are also looking at whether new imaging tests, such as MRI scans, or other blood and urine tests, can be used to decide which people with an elevated PSA should have a biopsy.\nInstead of a national screening programme, there is an informed choice programme called prostate cancer risk management for healthy men and anyone with a prostate aged 50 or over who ask their GP about PSA testing. It aims to give men and anyone with a prostate good information on the pros and cons of a PSA test.\nIf you&#8217;re aged&nbsp;50 or over with a prostate and decide to have your PSA levels tested after talking to your GP, they&nbsp;will be able to arrange for it to be carried out for free on the NHS.\nIf results show you have a&nbsp;raised level of PSA, your GP may suggest further tests.\nBecause the results of the PSA test are not as reliable as doctors would like, other tests and investigations are needed to diagnose prostate cancer.\nA PSA test cannot identify prostate cancer on its own, and changes in PSA levels alone are not a good reason to start treatment.\nIf you are thinking about asking for a PSA test, it is important that you first discuss whether it is right for you&nbsp;with your GP so you understand what the results might mean.\nThe Prostate Cancer Risk Management Programme has information on the risks and benefits of the PSA test to help you decide whether or not to have it.\nDoctors will use the results of your prostate examination, biopsy and scans to identify the&nbsp;&#8216;stage&#8217; of your prostate cancer (how far the cancer has spread). The stage of the cancer will determine which types of treatments will be necessary.\nA widely used method of staging is&nbsp;a&nbsp;number staging system. The stages are:\n- stage 1 – the cancer is very small and completely within the prostate gland\n- stage 2 – the cancer is within the prostate gland, but is larger\n- stage 3 – the cancer has spread from the prostate and may have grown into the tubes that carry semen\n- stage 4 – the cancer has spread into the lymph nodes or another part of the body, including the bladder, rectum or bones; about 20 to 30% of cases are diagnosed at this stage&nbsp;\nIf prostate cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, the chances of survival are generally good.&nbsp;\nRead further information:\n- Cancer Research UK: The stages of prostate cancer\nWatchful waiting&nbsp;is often recommended for older men and anyone with a prostate when it is unlikely that the cancer&nbsp;will affect your natural life span.\nIf the cancer is in its early stages and not causing symptoms, you may decide to delay treatment, and wait to see if any symptoms of progressive cancer develop. If this happens, pain medication and hormone medication to control prostate cancer are usually used.\nWatchful waiting may also be recommended for people with a higher risk of prostate cancer if:\n- your general health means you are unable to receive&nbsp;any form of treatment\n- your life expectancy means you will die with the cancer rather than from it\nIn this case, hormone treatment may be started if there are symptoms caused by the prostate cancer.\nActive surveillance aims to avoid unnecessary treatment of harmless cancers, while still providing timely treatment for men and anyone with a prostate who needs it.\nWhen they are diagnosed, around half to two-thirds of men and anyone with a prostate with low-risk prostate cancer do not need&nbsp;treatment. Surveillance is a safe strategy that provides a period of observation to gather extra information over time to see whether the disease is changing.\nActive surveillance involves you having regular PSA tests and&nbsp;often several&nbsp;biopsies to ensure&nbsp;any signs of progression are found as early as possible. Sometimes, MRI scans may also be carried out. If these tests reveal the cancer is changing or progressing,&nbsp;you can then make a decision about further treatment.\nAbout 1 in 3 people who undergo surveillance will later have treatment. This does not mean they made the wrong initial decision. Good evidence shows&nbsp;that active surveillance is safe over an average of 6 years. Men undergoing active surveillance&nbsp;will have delayed any treatment-related side effects, and those who eventually need treatment&nbsp;will be reassured&nbsp;that it was necessary.\nA radical prostatectomy is the surgical removal of your prostate gland. This treatment is an option for curing localised prostate cancer and locally-advanced prostate cancer.\nLike any operation, this surgery carries some risks, and there may be some side effects:\n- some people have problems with urinary incontinence&nbsp;– this can range from leaking small drips of urine, to leaking larger amounts but this usually clears up within 3 to 6 months of the operation\n- some men have problems getting an erection (erectile dysfunction) – this sometimes improves with time, but around half will have long-term problems\n- in extremely rare cases, problems arising after surgery can be fatal\nFor many men and anyone with a prostate, having a radical prostatectomy will get rid of the cancer cells. However, for around 1 in 3 people, the cancer cells may not be fully removed, and the cancer cells may return sometime after the operation.\nRadiotherapy after prostate removal surgery may increase the chances of a cure, although research is still being carried out into when it should be used after surgery.\nAfter a radical prostatectomy, you will no longer ejaculate during sex. This means&nbsp;that you will not be able to have a child through sexual intercourse. You may want to ask your doctors about storing a sperm sample before the operation, so&nbsp;it can be used later for in vitro fertilisation (IVF).\nRead further information:\n- Macmillan: Surgery for early prostate cancer\nRadiotherapy&nbsp;involves using radiation to kill cancerous cells. This treatment is an option for curing localised prostate cancer and locally-advanced prostate cancer. Radiotherapy can also be used to slow the progression of metastatic prostate cancer and relieve symptoms.\nRadiotherapy is normally given as an outpatient at a hospital near you. It is done in short sessions for 5 days a week, for 4 to 8 weeks. There are short-term and long-term side effects associated with radiotherapy.\nYou may receive hormone therapy before undergoing radiotherapy to increase the chance of successful treatment. Hormone therapy may also be recommended after radiotherapy to reduce the chances of cancerous cells returning.\nShort-term effects of radiotherapy can include:\n- discomfort around the rectum and anus (the opening through which stools pass out of your body)\n- diarrhoea&nbsp;\n- loss of pubic hair\n- tiredness\n- cystitis – an inflammation of the bladder lining, which can cause you to urinate frequently; urination may be painful\nPossible long-term side effects can include:\n- an inability to obtain an erection\n- urinary incontinence\n- back passage problems (diarrhoea, bleeding, discomfort)\nAs with radical prostatectomy, there is a 1 in3 chance the cancer will return. In these cases, medication is usually used to control the cancer instead of surgery. This is because there is a higher risk of complications from surgery in men and anyone with a prostate who have previously had radiotherapy.\nSome hospitals now offer new minimally invasive treatments if radiotherapy fails to work, sometimes&nbsp;as part of a clinical&nbsp;trial. These new treatments are called high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) and cryotherapy. These treatments have fewer side effects, but the long-term outcomes are not yet known.\nRead further information:\n- Macmillan Cancer Support: Radiotherapy for prostate cancer\nBrachytherapy is a form of radiotherapy where the radiation dose is delivered inside the prostate gland. It is also known as internal or interstitial radiotherapy.\nThe radiation can be delivered using a number of tiny radioactive seeds that are surgically implanted into the tumour. This is called low dose-rate brachytherapy.\nThe radiation can also be delivered through hollow, thin needles placed inside the prostate. This is called high dose-rate brachytherapy.\nThis method has the advantage of delivering a high dose of radiation to the prostate, while minimising damage to other tissues. However, the risk of sexual dysfunction and urinary problems is the same as with radiotherapy, although the risk of bowel problems is slightly lower.\nRead further information:\n- Cancer Research UK: Internal radiotherapy (brachytherapy) for prostate cancer\nHormone therapy is often used in combination with radiotherapy. For example, you may receive hormone therapy before undergoing radiotherapy to increase the chance of a successful treatment. Hormone therapy may also be recommended after radiotherapy to reduce the chances of cancerous cells returning.\nHormone therapy alone should not normally be used to treat&nbsp;localised prostate cancer in&nbsp;people who are fit and willing to receive surgery or radiotherapy. This is because it does not cure the cancer on its own.&nbsp;Hormone therapy&nbsp;can be used to slow the progression of advanced prostate cancer and relieve symptoms.\nHormones control the growth of cells in the prostate. In particular, prostate cancer needs the hormone testosterone to grow. The purpose of hormone therapy is to block the effects of testosterone, either by stopping its production or by stopping your body being able to use testosterone.\nHormone therapy can be given as:\n- injections to stop your body making testosterone, called luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists\n- tablets to block the effects or reduce the production of testosterone, called anti-androgen treatment\n- combined LHRH and anti-androgen treatment\nThe main side effects of hormone treatment are caused by their effects on testosterone. They usually go away when treatment stops. They include&nbsp;loss of sex drive and erectile dysfunction (this is more common with LHRH agonists than anti-androgens).\nOther possible side effects include:\n- hot flushes\n- sweating\n- weight gain\n- swelling and tenderness of the breasts\nAn alternative to hormone therapy is to surgically remove the testicles, called orchidectomy. The operation does not cure prostate cancer, but by removing the testosterone, it controls the growth of the cancer and its symptoms.&nbsp;\nRead further information:\n- Cancer Research UK: Hormone therapy for prostate cancer\nDuring&nbsp;TURP, a&nbsp;thin metal wire with a loop at the end is inserted into your urethra (the tube that carries urine from your bladder to your penis) and pieces of the prostate are removed.\nThis is carried out under&nbsp;general anaesthetic or a spinal anaesthetic (epidural).\nThis is done to relieve pressure from the urethra to treat any problematic symptoms you may have with urination. It does not cure the cancer.\nRead more information about&nbsp;transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).\nHIFU is sometimes used to treat men and anyone with a prostate with localised prostate cancer that has not spread beyond their prostate.\nAn ultrasound probe&nbsp;inserted into the rectum releases high-frequency sound waves through the wall of the rectum. These sound waves kill cancer cells in the prostate gland by heating them to a high temperature.\nThe risk of side effects&nbsp;from HIFU&nbsp;is&nbsp;usually lower than other treatments.\nHowever, possible effects can include impotence (in 5 to 10 in every 100) or urinary incontinence (in less than 1 in every 100). Back passage problems are rare.\nFistulas (an abnormal channel between the urinary system and rectum) are also rare, affecting less than 1 in every 500. This is because the treatment targets the cancer area only and not the whole prostate.\nHowever, HIFU treatment is still going through clinical trials for prostate cancer.&nbsp;In some cases, doctors can carry out HIFU treatment outside of clinical trials. HIFU is not widely available and its long-term effectiveness has not yet been conclusively proven.\nRead further information:\n- Cancer Research UK: High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for prostate cancer\nCryotherapy is a method of killing cancer cells by freezing them. It is sometimes used to treat men and anyone with a prostate with localised prostate cancer that has not spread beyond their prostate gland.\nTiny probes called cryoneedles are inserted into the prostate gland through the wall of the rectum. They freeze the prostate gland and kill the cancer cells, but some normal cells also die.\nThe aim is to kill cancer cells while causing as little damage as possible to healthy cells. The side effects of cryotherapy can include:\n- erectile dysfunction – this can affect between 2 and 9 in every 10\n- incontinence – this affects less than 1 in 20\nIt is rare for cryotherapy to cause&nbsp;rectal problems or fistulas.\nCryotherapy&nbsp;is still undergoing clinical trials for prostate cancer. In some cases, doctors can carry out cryotherapy treatment outside of clinical trials.&nbsp;It&nbsp;is not widely available&nbsp;and its long-term effectiveness has not yet been conclusively proven.\nIf the cancer has reached an advanced stage, it is no longer possible to cure it. However, it may be possible to slow its progression, prolong your life and relieve symptoms.\nTreatment options include:\n- radiotherapy\n- hormone treatment\n- chemotherapy\nIf the cancer has spread to your bones, medicines called bisphosphonates may be used. Bisphosphonates help reduce bone pain and bone loss.\nChemotherapy&nbsp;is mainly used to treat prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic prostate cancer) and which is not responding to hormone therapy.\nChemotherapy destroys cancer cells by interfering with the way they multiply. Chemotherapy does not cure prostate cancer, but can keep it under control and reduce symptoms (such as pain) so everyday life is less affected.\nThe main side effects of chemotherapy are caused by their effects on healthy cells, such as immune cells. They include infections, tiredness, hair loss, sore mouth, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting. Many of these side effects can be prevented or controlled with other medicines, which your doctor can prescribe for you.\nSteroid tablets are used when hormone therapy no longer works because the cancer is resistant to it. This is called hormone-refractory cancer.\nSteroids can be used to try to shrink the tumour and stop it from growing. The most effective steroid treatment is dexamethasone.\nThere are a number of new medications that could be used if hormones and chemotherapy fail. Your medical team&nbsp;can tell you if these are suitable and available for you.\nAs many of the treatments above have unpleasant side effects that can affect your quality of life, you may decide against treatment. This may be especially true if you are at an age when you feel that treating the cancer is unlikely to significantly extend your life expectancy.\nThis is entirely your decision, and your MDT will respect it.\nIf you decide not to have treatment, your GP and hospital team will still give you support and pain relief. This is called palliative care. Support is also available for your family and friends.\nIf you have no symptoms, prostate cancer should have little or no effect on your everyday activities. You should be able to work, care for your family, carry on your usual social and leisure activities, and look after yourself. However, you may be understandably worried about your future. This may make you feel anxious&nbsp;or depressed,&nbsp;and affect your sleep.\nIf your prostate cancer progresses, you may not feel well enough to do all the things you used to. After an operation or other treatment, such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy, you will probably feel tired and need time to recover.\nIf you have advanced prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of your body, you may have symptoms that slow you down and make it difficult to do things. You may have to reduce your working hours or stop working altogether.\nWhatever stage your prostate cancer has reached, try to give yourself time to do the things you enjoy and spend time with those who care about you.\nRead further information:\n- Cancer Research UK: Coping and support if you have prostate cancer\nIf you have erectile dysfunction, speak to your GP. It may be possible to treat you with a type of medicine known as phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5). PDE5s work by increasing the blood supply to your penis.\nThe most commonly used PDE5 is sildenafil (Viagra). Other PDE5s are available if sildenafil is not effective.\nAnother alternative is a device called a vacuum pump. It is a simple tube connected to a pump. You place your penis in the tube and then pump out all the air. This creates a vacuum, which causes the blood to rush to your penis. You then place a rubber ring around the base of your penis. This keeps the blood in place and allows you to maintain an erection for around 30 minutes.\nIf your urinary incontinence&nbsp;is mild, you may be able to control it by learning some simple exercises. Pelvic floor exercises can strengthen your control over your bladder.\nTo carry out pelvic floor exercises:\nIf your urinary incontinence is more severe, it may be possible to treat it with surgery. This would involve implanting an artificial sphincter – a sphincter is a muscle used to control the bladder.\nRead further information:\n- Prostate Cancer UK: Sex and relationships\n- Prostate Cancer UK: Urinary problems after prostate cancer treatment\nBeing&nbsp;diagnosed with prostate cancer often brings families and friends closer, although it can put pressure on relationships too.\nMost people want to help, though they may not know what to do. A few people find it hard to talk to someone with prostate cancer, and may try to avoid them. Being open and honest about how you feel and what your family and friends can do to help&nbsp;may put others at ease. But do not feel shy about telling people that&nbsp;you need some time to yourself, if that is what you need.\nRead further information:\n- Macmillan Cancer Support: Cancer and your emotions\n- Talking to your kids about cancer\nIf you have questions, your doctor or nurse may be able to reassure you, or you may find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor, psychologist or specialist helpline.

        "disease": "Psoriasis",
        "description": "Psoriasis is a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales.\nThese patches normally appear on your elbows, knees, scalp and lower back, but can appear anywhere on your body.&nbsp;Most people are only affected with small patches. In some cases, the patches can be itchy or sore.\nPsoriasis affects around 2% of people in the UK. It can start at any age, but most often develops in adults under 35 years old. The condition affects men and women equally.\nThe severity of psoriasis varies greatly from person to person. For some people it&#8217;s just a minor irritation, but for others it can have&nbsp;a major impact on their quality of life.\nPsoriasis is a long-lasting (chronic) disease that usually involves periods when you have no symptoms or&nbsp;mild symptoms, followed by periods when symptoms are more severe.\nRead more about the symptoms of psoriasis.\nPeople with psoriasis have an&nbsp;increased production of skin cells.\nSkin cells are normally&nbsp;made and replaced every 3&nbsp;to 4&nbsp;weeks, but in psoriasis this process only lasts about 3&nbsp;to 7&nbsp;days. The resulting build-up of skin cells is what creates the patches associated with psoriasis.\nAlthough the process isn&#8217;t fully understood, it&#8217;s thought&nbsp;to be related to a problem with the immune system. The immune system&nbsp;is your body&#8217;s defence against disease and infection, but for people with psoriasis, it attacks healthy skin cells by mistake.\nPsoriasis can run in families,&nbsp;although the exact role that genetics plays in causing psoriasis is unclear.\nMany people&#8217;s psoriasis symptoms start or become worse because of a certain event, known as a &#8220;trigger&#8221;. Possible triggers of psoriasis include&nbsp;an injury to your skin, throat infections and using certain medicines.\nThe condition isn&#8217;t contagious, so it can&#8217;t be spread from person to person.\nRead more about the&nbsp;causes of psoriasis.\nA GP can&nbsp;often diagnose psoriasis based on the appearance of your skin.\nIn rare cases, a small sample of skin, called a biopsy, will be sent to the laboratory for examination under a microscope. This determines the exact type of psoriasis and rules out other skin disorders, such as seborrhoeic dermatitis, lichen planus, lichen simplex and pityriasis rosea.\nYou may be referred to a dermatologist (a specialist in diagnosing and treating skin conditions) if your doctor is uncertain about your diagnosis, or if your condition is severe.\nIf your doctor suspects you have psoriatic arthritis, which is sometimes a complication of psoriasis, you may be referred to a rheumatologist (a doctor who specialises in arthritis). You may have blood tests to rule out other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and X-rays of the affected joints may be taken.\nThere&#8217;s no cure for psoriasis, but a range of treatments can improve symptoms and the appearance of skin patches.\nIn most cases, the first treatment used will be a topical treatment, such as vitamin D analogues or topical corticosteroids. Topical treatments are creams and ointments applied to the skin.\nIf these aren&#8217;t effective, or your condition is more severe, a treatment called phototherapy may be used. Phototherapy involves exposing your skin to certain types of ultraviolet light.\nIn severe cases, where the above treatments are ineffective, systemic treatments may be used. These are oral or injected medicines that work throughout the whole body.\nRead more about treating psoriasis.\nAlthough psoriasis is just a minor irritation for some people, it can have a significant impact on quality of life for those more severely affected.\nFor example,&nbsp;some people with psoriasis have low self-esteem because of the effect the condition has on their appearance. It&#8217;s also quite&nbsp;common&nbsp;to develop&nbsp;tenderness, pain and swelling in the joints and connective tissue. This is known as psoriatic arthritis.\nSpeak to your GP or healthcare team if you have psoriasis and you&nbsp;have any concerns about your physical and mental wellbeing. They&nbsp;can offer advice and further treatment if necessary. There are also support groups for people with psoriasis, such as The Psoriasis Association, where you can speak to other people with the condition.\nRead more about living with psoriasis.\nYou can find support and information from organisations like:\n- Changing Faces &#8211; a charity for people who have a visible difference or facial disfigurement, who can be contacted on 0300 012 0275 for counselling and advice\n- The Psoriasis Association &#8211; provides support groups for people with psoriasis where you can speak to other people with the condition\nPsoriasis typically causes patches of skin that are dry, red and covered in silver scales. Some people find their psoriasis causes itching or soreness.\nThere are several different types of psoriasis. Many people have only&nbsp;one&nbsp;form of psoriasis at a time, although 2&nbsp;different types can occur together. One type may change into another type, or become more severe.\nMost cases of psoriasis go through cycles, causing problems for a few weeks or months before easing or stopping.\nYou should see your GP if you think you may have psoriasis.\nThis is the most common form, accounting for about 80% of cases. Its symptoms are dry, red skin lesions, known as plaques, which are covered in silver scales. They normally appear on your elbows, knees, scalp and lower back, but can appear anywhere on your body. The plaques can be itchy, sore or both. In severe cases, the skin around your joints may crack and bleed.&nbsp;\nThis can occur on parts of your scalp or on the whole scalp. It causes red patches of skin covered in thick silvery-white scales. Some people find scalp psoriasis extremely itchy, while others have no discomfort. In extreme cases it can cause hair loss, although this is usually only temporary.\nIn about half of all people with psoriasis, the condition affects the nails. Psoriasis can cause your nails to develop tiny dents or pits, become discoloured, or grow abnormally. Nails can often&nbsp;become loose and separate from your nail bed. In severe cases, your nails may crumble.\nGuttate psoriasis causes small (less than 1cm or 1/3 inch) drop-shaped sores on your chest, arms, legs and scalp. There&#8217;s a good chance that guttate psoriasis will disappear completely after a few weeks, but some people go on to develop plaque psoriasis.\nThis&nbsp;type of psoriasis sometimes&nbsp;occurs after a streptococcal throat infection and is more common among children and teenagers.\nThis affects folds or creases in your skin, such as the armpits, groin, between the buttocks and under the breasts. It can cause large, smooth red patches in some or all of these areas. Inverse psoriasis is made worse by friction and sweating, so it can be particularly uncomfortable in hot weather.\nPustular psoriasis is a rarer type of psoriasis that causes pus-filled blisters (pustules) to appear on your skin. Different types of pustular psoriasis affect different parts of the body.\nThis causes pustules on a wide area of skin, which develop very quickly. The pus consists of white blood cells and is not a sign of infection. The pustules may reappear every few days or weeks in cycles. During the start of these cycles, von Zumbusch psoriasis can cause fever, chills, weight loss and fatigue.\nThis causes pustules to appear on the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet. The pustules gradually develop into circular brown, scaly spots, which then peel off. Pustules may reappear every few days or weeks.\nThis causes pustules to appear on your fingers and toes. The pustules then burst, leaving bright red areas that may ooze or become scaly. These may lead to painful nail deformities.\nErythrodermic psoriasis is a rare form of psoriasis that affects nearly all the skin on the body. This can cause intense itching or burning. Erythrodermic psoriasis can cause your body to lose proteins and fluid, leading to further problems such as infection, dehydration, heart failure, hypothermia and malnutrition.\nPsoriasis occurs when skin cells are replaced more quickly than usual. It&#8217;s not known exactly why this happens, but research suggests it&#8217;s caused by a problem with the immune system.\nYour body produces new skin cells in the deepest layer of skin. These skin cells gradually move up through the layers of skin until they reach the outermost level. Then they die and flake off. This whole process normally takes around 3&nbsp;to 4&nbsp;weeks.\nIn people with psoriasis, this process only takes about 3&nbsp;to 7&nbsp;days. As a result, cells that aren&#8217;t fully mature build up rapidly on the surface of the skin, causing red, flaky, crusty patches covered with silvery scales.\nYour immune system is your body&#8217;s defence against disease and it helps fight infection. One of the main types of cell used by the immune system is called a T-cell.\nT-cells normally travel through the body to detect and fight invading germs such as bacteria, but in people with psoriasis they start to attack healthy skin cells by mistake. This causes the deepest layer of skin to produce new skin cells more quickly than usual, which in turn triggers the immune system to produce more T-cells.\nIt&#8217;s not known what exactly causes this problem with the immune system, although certain genes and environmental triggers may&nbsp;play a role.\nPsoriasis runs in families. 1&nbsp;in 3&nbsp;people with psoriasis has a close relative with the condition.\nHowever, the exact role that genetics plays in causing psoriasis is unclear. Research studies have shown many different genes are linked to the development of psoriasis. It&#8217;s likely that different combinations of genes may make people more vulnerable to the condition. However, having these genes doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean you&#8217;ll develop it.\nMany people&#8217;s psoriasis symptoms start or become worse because of a certain event, known as a trigger. Knowing your triggers may&nbsp;help you to&nbsp;avoid a flare-up. Common triggers include:\n- an injury to your skin, such as a cut, scrape, insect bite or sunburn (this is known as the Koebner response)\n- drinking excessive amounts of alcohol\n- smoking\n- stress\n- hormonal changes, particularly in women (for example, during&nbsp;puberty and the menopause)\n- certain medicines&nbsp;such as&nbsp;lithium, some antimalarial medicines, anti-inflammatory medicines including ibuprofen, ACE inhibitors (used to treat high blood pressure) and&nbsp;beta blockers (used to treat congestive heart failure)\n- throat infections – in some people, usually children and young adults, a form of psoriasis called guttate psoriasis develops after a streptococcal throat infection (although most people who have streptococcal throat infections don&#8217;t develop psoriasis)\n- other immune disorders, such as HIV,&nbsp;which cause psoriasis to flare up or to appear for the first time\nPsoriasis isn&#8217;t contagious, so it can&#8217;t be spread from person to person.\nTreatments are determined by the type and severity of your psoriasis and the area of skin affected. Your&nbsp;doctor will probably start with a mild treatment, such as topical creams (which are applied to the skin), and then move on to stronger treatments if necessary.\nA&nbsp;wide range of treatments&nbsp;are available&nbsp;for psoriasis, but identifying which treatment is most effective can be difficult. Talk to your&nbsp;doctor if you feel a treatment isn&#8217;t working or you have uncomfortable side effects.\nTreatments fall into 3&nbsp;categories:\n- topical – creams and ointments that&nbsp;are applied to your skin\n- phototherapy – your skin is exposed to certain types of ultraviolet&nbsp;light\n- systemic– oral and injected medications that work throughout the entire body\nOften, different types of treatment are used in combination.\nYour treatment for psoriasis may need to be reviewed regularly. You may want to make a care plan (an agreement between you and your health professional)&nbsp;as this can help you manage your day-to-day health.\nThe various treatments for&nbsp;psoriasis are outlined below. You can also read a summary of the pros and cons of the treatments for psoriasis, allowing you to compare your treatment options.\nTopical treatments are usually the first treatments used for mild to moderate&nbsp;psoriasis. These are creams and ointments you apply to affected areas.&nbsp;\nSome people find that topical treatments&nbsp;are all&nbsp;they&nbsp;need to control their condition, although&nbsp;it may take up to 6&nbsp;weeks before&nbsp;there&#8217;s a noticeable effect.\nIf you&nbsp;have scalp psoriasis, a combination of shampoo and ointment may be recommended.\nEmollients are moisturising treatments applied directly to the skin to reduce water loss and cover it with a protective film. If you have mild psoriasis, an emollient is probably the first treatment your GP will suggest.\nThe main benefit of emollients is to reduce itching and scaling. Some topical treatments are thought to work better on moisturised skin. It&#8217;s important to wait at least half an hour before applying a topical treatment after an emollient.\nEmollients are available&nbsp;as a wide&nbsp;variety of products and can be bought over the counter from a pharmacy&nbsp;or prescribed by your GP, nurse or health visitor.\nSteroid creams or ointments (topical corticosteroids) are commonly used to treat mild to moderate psoriasis in most areas of the body. The treatment works by reducing inflammation. This slows the production of skin cells and reduces itching.\nTopical corticosteroids range in strength from mild to very strong. Only use topical corticosteroids when recommended by your doctor. Stronger topical corticosteroids can be prescribed by your doctor and should only be used on small areas of&nbsp;skin or on particularly thick patches. Overusing topical corticosteroids can lead to skin thinning.\nVitamin D analogue creams are commonly used along with or instead of&nbsp;steroid creams&nbsp;for mild to moderate psoriasis affecting areas such as the limbs, trunk or scalp. They work by slowing the production of skin cells. They also have an anti-inflammatory effect.\nExamples of vitamin D analogues are calcipotriol, calcitriol and tacalcitol. There are very few side effects, as long as you don&#8217;t&nbsp;use more than the recommended amount.\nCalcineurin inhibitors,&nbsp;such as&nbsp;tacrolimus and pimecrolimus,&nbsp;are ointments or creams that reduce the activity of the immune system and help to reduce inflammation. They&#8217;re sometimes used to treat psoriasis affecting sensitive areas (such as the scalp, the genitals and folds in the skin) if&nbsp;steroid creams&nbsp;aren&#8217;t effective.\nThese medications can cause skin irritation or a burning and itching sensation when they&#8217;re started, but this usually improves within a week.\nCoal tar is a thick, heavy oil and is probably the oldest treatment for psoriasis. How it works isn&#8217;t exactly known, but it can reduce scales, inflammation and itchiness. It may be used to treat psoriasis&nbsp;affecting the limbs, trunk or scalp if other topical treatments aren&#8217;t effective.&nbsp;\nCoal tar can stain clothes and bedding, and has a strong smell. It can be used in combination with phototherapy (see below).\nDithranol has been used for over 50 years to treat psoriasis. It has been shown to be effective in suppressing the production of skin cells and has few side effects. However, it&nbsp;can burn if too concentrated.\nIt&#8217;s typically used as a short-term treatment for psoriasis affecting the limbs or trunk under hospital supervision, as it stains everything it comes into contact with, including skin, clothes and bathroom fittings. It&#8217;s applied to your skin (while wearing gloves) and left for 10&nbsp;to 60 minutes before being washed off.\nDithranol can be used in combination with phototherapy (see below).\nPhototherapy uses natural and artificial light to treat psoriasis. Artificial light therapy can be given in hospitals and some specialist centres, usually under the care of a dermatologist. These treatments aren&#8217;t the same as using a sunbed.\nUltraviolet B (UVB) phototherapy uses a wavelength of light that is invisible to human eyes. The light slows down the production of skin cells and is an effective treatment for some types of psoriasis that haven&#8217;t responded to topical treatments. Each session only takes a few minutes, but you may need to go to hospital 2&nbsp;or 3&nbsp;times a week for 6&nbsp;to 8&nbsp;weeks.\nFor this treatment, you&#8217;ll first be given a tablet containing compounds called psoralens, or psoralen may be applied directly to the skin. This makes your skin more sensitive to light. Your skin is then exposed to a wavelength of light called ultraviolet A (UVA). This light penetrates your skin more deeply than ultraviolet B light.\nThis treatment may be used if you have severe psoriasis that hasn&#8217;t responded to other treatment. Side effects of the treatment include nausea, headaches, burning and itchiness. You may need to wear special glasses for 24 hours after taking the tablet to prevent the development of cataracts. Long-term use of this treatment isn&#8217;t encouraged, as it can increase your risk of developing skin cancer.\nCombining phototherapy with other treatments often increases its effectiveness. Some doctors use UVB phototherapy in combination with coal tar, as the coal tar makes the skin more receptive to light. Combining UVB phototherapy with dithranol cream may also be effective (this is known as Ingram treatment).\nIf your psoriasis is severe&nbsp;or other treatments haven&#8217;t worked, you may be prescribed systemic treatments by a specialist. Systemic treatments are&nbsp;treatments that work throughout the entire body.\nThese medications can be very effective in treating psoriasis, but they all have potentially serious side effects. All the systemic treatments for psoriasis have benefits and risks. Before starting treatment, talk to your doctor about your treatment options and any risks associated with them.\nThere are 2&nbsp;main types of systemic treatment, called non-biological (usually given as tablets or capsules) and biological (usually given as injections). These are described in more detail below.\nMethotrexate&nbsp;can help to control psoriasis by slowing down&nbsp;the production of skin cells and suppressing inflammation. It&#8217;s usually taken once a week.\nMethotrexate can cause nausea and&nbsp;may affect the production of blood cells. Long-term use can cause liver damage. People who have liver disease shouldn&#8217;t take methotrexate, and you shouldn&#8217;t drink alcohol when taking it.\nMethotrexate can be very harmful to a developing baby, so it&#8217;s&nbsp;important that women use contraception and don&#8217;t become pregnant while they take this drug and for 3&nbsp;months after they stop. Methotrexate can also affect the development of sperm cells, so men shouldn&#8217;t father a child during treatment and for 3&nbsp;weeks afterwards.\nCiclosporin is a medicine that suppresses your immune system (immunosuppressant). It was originally used to prevent transplant rejection, but has proved effective in treating all types of psoriasis. It&#8217;s usually taken daily.\nCiclosporin increases your chances of kidney disease and high blood pressure, which will need to be monitored.\nAcitretin is an oral retinoid that reduces the production of skin cells. It&#8217;s used to treat severe psoriasis that hasn&#8217;t responded to other non-biological systemic treatments. It&#8217;s usually taken daily.\nAcitretin&nbsp;has a wide range of side effects, including dryness and cracking of the lips, dryness of the nasal passages&nbsp;and, in rarer cases, hepatitis.\nAcitretin can be very harmful to a developing baby, so it&#8217;s important that women use contraception and don&#8217;t become pregnant while they take this drug, and for 2&nbsp;years after they stop taking it. However, it&#8217;s safe for a man taking acitretin&nbsp;to father&nbsp;a baby.\nBiological treatments reduce inflammation by targeting overactive cells in the immune system.&nbsp;These treatments are usually used if you&nbsp;have severe psoriasis that hasn&#8217;t responded to other treatments, or if you can&#8217;t use other treatments.\nEtanercept is injected twice a week and you&#8217;ll be shown how to do this. If there&#8217;s no improvement in your psoriasis after 12 weeks, the treatment will be stopped.\nThe main side effect of etanercept is a rash where the injection is given. However, as etanercept affects the whole immune system, there&#8217;s a risk of serious side effects, including severe infection. If you had&nbsp;tuberculosis in the past, there&#8217;s a risk&nbsp;it may return. You&#8217;ll be monitored for side effects during your treatment.\nAdalimumab is injected once every 2&nbsp;weeks and you&#8217;ll be shown how to do this. If there&#8217;s no improvement in your psoriasis after 16 weeks, the treatment will be stopped.\nAdalimumab can be harmful to a developing baby, so it&#8217;s important that women use contraception and don&#8217;t become pregnant while they take this drug, and for 5&nbsp;months after the treatment finishes.\nThe main side effects of adalimumab include headaches, a rash at the injection site and nausea. However, as adalimumab affects the whole immune system, there&#8217;s a risk of serious side effects, including severe infections. You&#8217;ll be monitored for side effects during your treatment.\nInfliximab is given as a drip (infusion) into your vein at the hospital. You&#8217;ll have 3&nbsp;infusions in the first 6&nbsp;weeks, then 1&nbsp;infusion every 8&nbsp;weeks. If there&#8217;s no improvement in your psoriasis after 10 weeks, the treatment will be stopped.\nThe main side effect of infliximab is a headache. However, as infliximab affects the whole immune system, there&#8217;s a risk of serious side effects, including severe infections. You&#8217;ll be monitored for side effects during your treatment.\nUstekinumab is injected at the beginning of treatment, then again 4&nbsp;weeks later. After this, injections are every 12 weeks. If there&#8217;s no improvement in your psoriasis after 16 weeks, the treatment will be stopped.\nThe main side effects of ustekinumab are a throat infection and a rash at the injection site. However, as ustekinumab affects the whole immune system, there&#8217;s a risk of serious side effects, including severe infections. You&#8217;ll be monitored for side effects during your treatment.\nAlthough psoriasis is just a minor irritation for some people, it can have a significant impact on quality of life for those more severely affected.\nIf you have psoriasis, you may find the following advice helpful.\nSelf care is an&nbsp;essential part of your daily life.&nbsp;It involves taking responsibility for your own health and wellbeing with support from those involved in your care. Self care includes&nbsp;staying fit and maintaining good physical and mental health, preventing illness or accidents, and caring more effectively for minor illnesses and long-term conditions.\nPeople with long-term conditions can benefit enormously from self care. They can live longer, have less pain, anxiety, depression and fatigue,&nbsp;a better quality of life, and be more active and independent. Having a care plan will help you manage your treatment so that it fits your lifestyle.\nIt&#8217;s important to use your treatment as prescribed, even if your psoriasis improves. Continuous treatment can help to prevent flare-ups. If you have any questions or concerns about your treatment or any side effects, talk to your GP or healthcare team.\nBecause psoriasis&nbsp;is usually&nbsp;a long-term condition, you may be in regular contact with your healthcare team. Discuss your symptoms or concerns with them, as&nbsp;the more the team knows, the more&nbsp;they can help you.\nPeople with psoriasis have a slightly higher risk of developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease than the general population, although it&#8217;s not known why. Regular exercise and a healthy diet are recommended for everyone, not just people with psoriasis, because they can help to prevent many health problems.\nEating a healthy, balanced diet and exercising regularly can also relieve stress, which may improve your psoriasis.\nBecause of&nbsp;the effect that psoriasis can have on physical appearance, low self-esteem and anxiety are common among people with&nbsp;the condition. This can&nbsp;lead to&nbsp;depression, especially if the psoriasis gets worse.\nYour GP or dermatologist will understand the psychological and emotional impact of&nbsp;psoriasis, so talk to them about your concerns or anxieties.\nSome&nbsp;people with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis. This causes tenderness, pain and swelling in the joints and connective tissue, as well as stiffness. It commonly affects the ends of the fingers and toes. In some people, it affects the lower back, neck and knees. Most people develop psoriatic arthritis after psoriasis,&nbsp;but about&nbsp;20%&nbsp;develop it&nbsp;before they&#8217;re diagnosed with psoriasis.\nThere&#8217;s no single test for psoriatic arthritis. It&#8217;s normally diagnosed using a combination of methods, including&nbsp;looking at your medical history, physical examinations, blood tests, X-rays and MRI scans. If you have psoriasis, you&#8217;ll usually have an annual assessment to look for signs of psoriatic arthritis.\nIf&nbsp;your doctor&nbsp;thinks you have psoriatic arthritis, you&#8217;ll usually be referred to a specialist called a rheumatologist, so you can be treated with anti-inflammatory or anti-rheumatic medicines.\nPsoriasis doesn&#8217;t affect fertility, and women with psoriasis can have a normal pregnancy and a healthy baby. Some women find their psoriasis improves during pregnancy,&nbsp;but for others&nbsp;it gets worse.\nTalk to your healthcare team if you&#8217;re thinking of having a baby. Some treatments for psoriasis can be harmful to a developing baby, so use contraception while taking them.&nbsp;This can apply to both men and women, depending on the medication. Your healthcare team can suggest the best&nbsp;ways to&nbsp;control your psoriasis before you start trying for a family.\nMany people with psoriasis have found that getting involved in support groups helps them. Support groups can increase your self-confidence, reduce&nbsp;feelings of isolation,&nbsp;and give you&nbsp;practical advice about living with the condition.\nFurther information and support for psoriasis is available from the charity Changing Faces.\n&nbsp;\n"

        "disease": "Psoriatic arthritis",
        "description": "Psoriatic arthritis is a type of arthritis that sometimes develops in people with the skin condition psoriasis. It affects the joints and can cause them to become swollen, stiff and painful.\nIt is estimated that around 1 in 4 patients with psoriasis have psoriatic arthritis.\nIn most cases, people will experience problems with their skin before they notice any symptoms in their joints. In a small number of cases, skin problems may start at the same time as joint problems or after.\nPsoriatic arthritis can be caused by the immune system wrongly attacking healthy tissue. It’s not clear why some people with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis and others don’t.\nPsoriatic arthritis can affect any joint in the body. It causes pain, swelling and stiffness in the joints. It often affects particular areas including the:\n- hands\n- feet\n- knees\n- elbows\n- neck and spine\nPsoriatic arthritis can also affect the area where tendons and ligaments are connected to the bone. This is called entheses or enthesitis when inflamed.\nSometimes, the whole finger or toe can get inflamed and look sausage-like. This is called dactylitis\nSymptoms usually develop slowly. This means that many people don&#8217;t know they&#8217;re developing psoriatic arthritis. In rare cases, symptoms can develop suddenly without warning.\nThe severity of psoriatic arthritis varies. Some people may have severe problems affecting many joints. Others may only notice mild symptoms in 1 or 2 joints.\nThere may be times when your symptoms get better and worse. These are called flare-ups or relapses. Some people may reach a point where they have no symptoms at all (known as remission).\nRelapses can be hard to predict. But they can be managed with medication.\nYou should do this even if you haven&rsquo;t been diagnosed with psoriasis.\nYou should have check-ups at least once a year if you have been diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis. Make sure you let your doctor know if you’re experiencing any problems with your joints.\nIf your doctor thinks you may have psoriatic arthritis, they should refer you to a rheumatologist for an assessment. A rheumatologist is a specialist in joint conditions.\nIf you have psoriasis and problems with your joints, a rheumatologist should be able to diagnose psoriatic arthritis. Other types of arthritis, like rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, would need to be ruled out first.\nYou may get some tests to help confirm a diagnosis, including:\n- blood tests to check for signs of inflammation and other types of arthritis\n- X-rays of your joints\n- scans of your joints\nThe main aims of treatment will be to:\n- help your symptoms\n- slow the progression of the condition\n- improve your quality of life\nYou may be prescribed medication to help treat psoriatic arthritis. For example:\n- non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\n- steroid medications\n- disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs)\nSome people may be prescribed other medications to block chemicals that activate the immune system. These are known as biological medications. But, you will usually be given DMARDs to try first.\nFor most people, this will mean trying many different medications. Some of these can also treat psoriasis.\nAs with psoriasis and other types of inflammatory arthritis, you may be more likely to get some other conditions (such as cardiovascular disease (CVD)) if you have psoriatic arthritis.\nCVD is the term for conditions of the heart or blood vessels, such as heart disease and stroke.\nYour GP should carry out tests each year (such as blood pressure and cholesterol tests) so they can check whether you have CVD. They may offer additional treatment, if necessary.\nPsoriatic arthritis can also cause inflammation of the eyes, such as Conjunctivitis and Iritis.\nIf psoriatic arthritis affects your skin and joints, you may notice changes in your nails such as:\n- dents\n- pits\n- discolouration\n- loosening from the nail bed\nThis is less common if only your skin is affected.\nAs well as your GP and a rheumatologist, you may also be cared for by:\n- a specialist nurse – often your first point of contact with your specialist care team\n- a dermatologist (skin specialist) – responsible for treating psoriasis symptoms\n- a physiotherapist – can create an exercise plan to keep your joints mobile\n- an occupational therapist – can help you overcome difficulties in your everyday life\n- a psychologist – can offer psychological support if you need it\n- a podiatrist – can offer assessment and advice on foot problems\nPsoriatic arthritis is a long-term condition. When it affects many joints, regular treatment will likely be needed to keep the disease under control.\nAn early diagnosis and the right treatment can slow down the progression of psoriatic arthritis. Treatment can also help reduce or prevent permanent damage to your joints.\nIn some patients with severe disease, the joints may become permanently damaged or deformed, requiring surgical treatment.\nYou can also help yourself by:\n- having a good balance between rest and regular physical activity\n- losing weight, if you’re overweight\n- not smoking\n- only drinking moderate amounts of alcohol\nLosing weight will help your general health and reduce the strain on your joints. There is evidence that weight loss can also improve the control of psoriatic arthritis and the response to treatment.\nRead more about how to lose weight safely\nSeveral studies have shown that patients with psoriatic arthritis who don&#8217;t smoke tend to have less severe disease and respond much better to treatment compared to those who do smoke.\nRead more about stopping smoking"

        "disease": "Psychosis",
        "description": "Psychosis is when people lose some touch with reality. They may hear or see things that aren&#8217;t there (hallucinations) or believe things that aren&#8217;t true (delusions). Their thoughts and words may also be confused (disordered).\nSymptoms of psychosis\nThe main symptoms of psychosis are:\n- hallucinations – someone sees, hears, feels, tastes, or smells things that aren&#8217;t real, often this can mean they hear voices\n- delusions – someone believes things that are untrue, often this can lead them to believe that someone is trying to harm them.\n- disordered thinking or speaking – their speech may be fast or constant, they may also switch from one topic to another mid-sentence\nThe symptoms of psychosis are often known as having a psychotic episode.\nPeople who have psychotic episodes are often unaware their behaviour is unusual. They&#8217;re also usually unaware that their delusions or hallucinations are not real.\nIf you&#8217;re worried about someone, you could contact their GP practice for them.\nIf they&#8217;re already getting support from a mental health service, contact the service directly.\nMind has information and guidance for friends and family of someone diagnosed with psychosis. This includes information on how to look after yourself while supporting someone else.\nPsychosis is sometimes caused by a specific mental health condition like:\n- schizophrenia – causes a range of psychological symptoms, including hallucinations and delusions\n- bipolar disorder – affects mood and can cause periods of depression and mania\n- severe depression\nPsychosis can also be triggered by:\n- a traumatic experience\n- stress\n- drug misuse\n- alcohol misuse\n- a physical condition, like a brain tumour or dementia\n- a side effect of a prescribed medicine\n- head injury\n- childbirth\nHow often a psychotic episode occurs and how long it lasts can depend on the underlying cause.\nPostnatal psychosis is a severe form of postnatal depression. This is a type of depression some women experience after having a baby.\nIt often happens during the first few weeks after having a baby.\nPostnatal psychosis is more likely to affect women who already have a mental health condition. For example, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia.\nYou or someone else has symptoms of postnatal psychosis like:\nPhone 999 if someone is at immediate risk of danger or harm.\nSpeak to your GP practice immediately if you experience psychotic episodes.\nIt&#8217;s important that psychosis is treated as soon as possible.\nYour GP may ask you some questions to help work out what&#8217;s causing your psychosis.\nThey should refer you to a mental health specialist for further assessment and treatment.\nTreatment for psychosis involves using a combination of:\n- anti-psychotic medication\n- psychological therapies – including talking therapies\n- social support\nSome people may have to take anti-psychotic medication long-term to manage their symptoms.\nDo not suddenly stop taking your medication as it may cause your symptoms to return.\nIf your psychotic episodes are severe, you may need to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital for treatment.\nYour treatment is likely to be coordinated by a team of mental health professionals working together. If this is your first psychotic episode, you may be referred to an early intervention team.\n\nAn early intervention team is a team of healthcare professionals. They work with people who have experienced their first episode of psychosis.\nDepending on your care needs, early intervention teams aim to provide:\n- a full assessment of your symptoms\n- prescriptions for medications\n- psychological services\nsocial, occupational, and educational support\nPeople with a history of psychosis are more likely to have drug or alcohol misuse problems, or both.\nSome people use drugs and alcohol as a way of managing the symptoms of psychosis. But, it can make symptoms worse or cause other problems\nPeople with psychosis are at a higher risk of self harm or suicide.\nSpeak to your GP practice if you&#8217;re self-harming.\nIf you&#8217;re feeling suicidal, you can:\n- speak to someone you trust, like a friend or family member\n- phone 111 and choose the mental health option\n- make an urgent appointment at your GP practice\n- if you have one, contact your mental health team"

The itching is caused by an allergy to the lice saliva or poo.\nIt can take 1 to 3 weeks for itching to develop after the first infestation, and it&#8217;ll usually be worse at night.\nPublic lice are very small (2mm long) and grey-brown in colour.\nThey&#8217;re hard to spot, but sometimes you may be able to see them in your hair. They live mostly on pubic hair, but can also be found in hair on the chest, armpits, face and eyelashes. They do not affect hair on your head.\nYou may also notice the following symptoms:\n- small red or blue spots on your skin (lice bites)\n- white or yellow dots attached to your hair (lice eggs)\n- dark red or brown spots in your underwear (lice poo)\n- crusty or sticky eyelashes, if they&#8217;re infected\nIf you think you might have pubic lice, get checked for free by:\n- booking an appointment at your local sexual health service\n- contacting your GP practice for an appointment\nThere is no test for pubic lice. Your doctor or nurse will check your hair for lice. They may check your pubic hair around your penis or vagina and any other areas that could be affected.\nTo help spot any pubic lice, your doctor or nurse may use a comb and a magnifying lens.\nYou can also buy treatment over the counter at your local pharmacy although they will not be able to diagnose the infestation.\nPubic lice are treated with medicated creams or shampoos that kill the lice.\nYou&#8217;ll usually need to use treatment on your whole body and leave it on for a few hours before washing it off. You&#8217;ll need to repeat this a week later to make sure all the lice have been killed.\nYou may be asked to come back to your GP practice or sexual health clinic once you&#8217;ve finished treatment to check the treatment has worked.\nYour partner(s) should also be treated, even if they do not have symptoms.\nSome pubic lice can be resistant to treatment. Resistance means that the lice will not be affected by a particular treatment. If your symptoms don’t settle, you may need to try more than one type of treatment.\nSpeak to your GP practice or local sexual health clinic if your first treatment hasn&#8217;t worked.\nTreatment of lice in the eye area is usually different from elsewhere. Certain creams and lotions are not safe for use near the eye area. Lice here can be removed with tweezers or Vaseline can be used to suffocate the lice before removal.\nWhile you&#8217;re being treated for pubic lice, there are some things you can do to help stop the lice from spreading.\nPubic lice are spread through close body contact with someone who has them, most commonly sexual contact.\nThe lice crawl from hair to hair but can&#8217;t fly or jump. They need human blood to survive, so generally only leave the body to move from one person to another.\nPubic lice don&#8217;t live on other animals such as cats or dogs.\nIf you or your partner has pubic lice, you should avoid having sex (vaginal, anal or oral). You should also avoid close bodily contact. Do this until you&#8217;ve both finished treatment, including any follow-up treatment.\nPubic lice are easily spread, and condoms don’t protect against them.\nTo reduce the risk of getting pubic lice, you should limit the number of people you have intimate or sexual contact with.\nIf you have been diagnosed with pubic lice you should get tested for other STIs including:\n- gonorrhoea\n- chlamydia\n- syphilis"

        "disease": "Pulmonary hypertension",
        "description": "Pulmonary hypertension is high pressure inside the pulmonary arteries, which are the vessels carrying blood from the right-hand side of the heart to the lungs.\nIt is a serious medical condition as it results in damage to the right-hand side of the heart muscle, making the heart muscle less efficient at pumping blood and oxygen around the body. This leads to symptoms such as:\n- shortness of breath&nbsp;\n- fatigue&nbsp;(tiredness)&nbsp;\n- feeling faint or dizzy\nIf it is not treated, pulmonary hypertension can cause heart failure, which is when the heart muscle struggles to pump enough blood around the body.&nbsp;\nThere are many different types of pulmonary hypertension&nbsp;and some are associated with underlying health conditions, particularly conditions affecting the heart or lungs. Pulmonary hypertension may be more common in people with:\n- sickle-cell anaemia&nbsp;\n- HIV&nbsp;\n- chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)&nbsp;\nGenerally, pulmonary hypertension can affect people of almost any age, although some types are more common in young women and some in people aged over 40.\nOne type of pulmonary hypertension, called pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), is more common in women and affects two to four people in every million each year.\nMore about the&nbsp;causes of pulmonary hypertension\nPulmonary hypertension is a serious condition that usually gets progressively worse. There may be a delay in getting a diagnosis, as the symptoms can be quite general.\nSymptoms such as breathlessness can significantly affect your quality of life, as you may be unable to continue with your regular activities. It&#8217;s important that you start treatment as soon as possible to improve your symptoms.\nIf&nbsp;you already have&nbsp;an underlying condition, which is&nbsp;causing your pulmonary hypertension, this should be treated first. In some cases, this can prevent permanent damage to your pulmonary arteries.\nIn the 1980s, people lived for an average of less than three years after being diagnosed with PAH. Now new medicines mean that people may be able to survive much longer. The course of the disease will depend on how quickly your condition is diagnosed, how advanced your symptoms are, and whether you have an&nbsp;underlying health condition.\nSymptoms of pulmonary hypertension include:\n- shortness of breath\n- fatigue (extreme tiredness)\n- dizziness\n- feeling faint\n- chest pain (angina)\n- a racing heartbeat (tachycardia)\nPeople with a particular type known as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) may not experience any symptoms until their condition is already quite advanced.\nSymptoms can become worse when you exercise, which may limit your ability to take part in physical activities. As your condition progresses, you may find it difficult to carry out even everyday activities.\nWhen pulmonary hypertension begins to affect your everyday life, this can have a negative impact on your quality of life and can lead to&nbsp;depression.\nIf you are&nbsp;feeling low&nbsp;and&nbsp;want to talk to someone, you can&nbsp;contact&nbsp;Breathing Space.&nbsp;\nUntreated pulmonary hypertension can lead to&nbsp;heart failure, which is when your heart muscle is struggling to pump blood around your body. As well as shortness of breath and tiredness, heart failure can also cause:\n- swelling in the legs, ankles and feet (oedema)&nbsp;\n- waking up in the middle of the night gasping for breath (paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea)&nbsp;\n- a cough that will not go away&nbsp;\n- nausea (feeling sick)&nbsp;\n- lack of appetite&nbsp;\n- weight loss\n- confusion or difficulties in concentrating&nbsp;\nPulmonary hypertension is caused by changes to the pulmonary arteries, the vessels carrying blood from your heart to your lungs.\nThe walls of your pulmonary arteries can become stiff and thickened, or may be blocked by something such as a blood clot. This makes it harder for your heart to push blood through these arteries, which increases the pressure inside the vessels and results in pulmonary hypertension.\nThere can be many different reasons for the changes to your arteries. The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified pulmonary hypertension into five different types, depending on the underlying cause:\n- pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)\n- pulmonary hypertension associated with left heart disease\n- pulmonary hypertension associated with lung disease and hypoxia&nbsp;\n- pulmonary hypertension due to blood clots\n- pulmonary hypertension due to other causes&nbsp;\nPulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is caused by problems with the smaller branches of the pulmonary arteries. In PAH, these changes are usually the core medical problem, rather than a condition that has started somewhere else and then affected the pulmonary arteries.\nUnlike the other types of pulmonary hypertension, PAH can therefore be treated directly, while in other cases the underlying cause is treated first.\nPAH is further divided into specific subtypes, outlined below.&nbsp;\nIdiopathic means the cause is unknown. If tests cannot find an underlying reason for your PAH, you may be diagnosed with idiopathic PAH. This is rare, affecting one or two people in every million each year.&nbsp;\nSome cases of PAH can run in families. It is thought that a particular genetic mutation (a change in one of the genes you inherit from your parents) can cause PAH. In up to&nbsp;10% of&nbsp;PAH cases,&nbsp;there may be a family history of the condition.\nPAH can be associated conditions that affect your blood vessels, such as:\n- pulmonary veno-occlusive disease&nbsp;– a rare condition that causes high blood pressure in the lungs\n- pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis&nbsp;– when capillaries (tiny blood vessels) grow within the lungs, causing blockages&nbsp;&nbsp;\nOther conditions or treatments associated with PAH include:\n- a condition affecting the structure or composition of your body tissue, such as scleroderma (a condition that causes hardening of the skin)\n- surgery to artificially connect the aorta (main artery from the left side of the heart) to the pulmonary artery&nbsp;– this is often done to treat&nbsp;congenital heart disease and increase the blood supply to the lungs&nbsp;\n- portal hypertension&nbsp;– a condition where the blood pressure inside the liver is abnormally high, leading to the development of swollen veins\n- HIV&nbsp;–&nbsp;one in 200 people with HIV will develop PAH\n- certain medications or drugs&nbsp;– such as fenfluramine, which is now no longer available, and amphetamines, a type of illegal drug\n- disorders of the thyroid gland&nbsp;&nbsp;\n- glycogen storage disorder (glycogen is a carbohydrate that produces short-term energy)&nbsp;\n- splenectomy&nbsp;– when you have had your spleen surgically removed&nbsp;\n- sickle cell anaemia (see below)\nSickle-cell anaemia&nbsp;is an inherited disorder where your red blood cells are abnormal and die prematurely, leading to a shortage of red blood cells. The lack of red blood cells means that haemoglobin, a protein normally found in these cells, is released into the blood.\nThe haemoglobin seeks out and destroys nitric oxide. This is a substance produced by your body and used to widen blood vessels. Without nitric oxide, your blood vessels remain narrow, which increases the blood pressure within them and can cause pulmonary hypertension.\nThis is a type of pulmonary hypertension estimated to affect&nbsp;two in every 1,000 newborn babies.&nbsp;\nIt has been linked to the mother taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) during the third trimester of the pregnancy (week 27 to the birth).\nConditions that may also be associated with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn include:\n- severe pulmonary hypoplasia&nbsp;– when your baby’s lungs are seriously underdeveloped&nbsp;&nbsp;\n- hypoglycaemia&nbsp;– an abnormally low level of glucose in the baby’s blood&nbsp;&nbsp;\n- sepsis&nbsp;– a life-threatening illness caused by the baby’s body overreacting to an infection\n- meconium aspiration syndrome&nbsp;– when a newborn baby breathes in a mixture of amniotic fluid (which surrounds them in the womb) and meconium (their first faeces), which can block their airways\nPulmonary hypertension may sometimes be associated with diseases affecting the left side of your heart (which pumps blood around the body). The left side of the heart is made up of:\n- the left atria (upper chamber)\n- the left ventricle (lower chamber)&nbsp;\n- the aortic and mitral valves&nbsp;– one-way valves that allow blood to flow through the heart in the correct direction\nBecause blood goes from the pulmonary arteries to the lungs and then to the left side of the heart, any problem with the left side of the heart could have a backwards effect on this circuit and affect the pulmonary arteries. This in turn could cause pulmonary hypertension.&nbsp;\nFor example, the mitral valve, which is located between the left atria and left ventricle, can become narrowed. If this happens, there will be a build-up of blood trying to get through the valve, which will increase blood pressure in the left atria. This could in turn increase pressure in the blood vessels between the lungs and the heart, and then feed back and increase pressure in the pulmonary arteries, leading to pulmonary hypertension.\nUp to&nbsp;60% of&nbsp;people with a condition causing severe left ventricle dysfunction have pulmonary hypertension. Almost all people with a severe mitral valve condition, and nearly two-thirds of those with a severe aortic valve condition, have pulmonary hypertension.\nPulmonary hypertension can also be&nbsp;associated with lung diseases or hypoxia (a shortage of oxygen in the body). This includes:\n- chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)&nbsp; – a collection of lung diseases, such as emphysema, where people have trouble breathing –&nbsp;over half of people with advanced COPD may have pulmonary hypertension, although it is usually mild&nbsp;&nbsp;\n- interstitial lung disease&nbsp;– a group of lung disorders that cause scarring of your lung tissue, making it difficult to get enough oxygen into your body –&nbsp;around a third of people with interstitial lung disease may have pulmonary hypertension&nbsp;\n- sleep-disordered breathing&nbsp;– conditions that affect your breathing while you are in deep sleep, such as&nbsp;obstructive sleep apnoea&nbsp;&nbsp;\nThese types of conditions can restrict the amount of oxygen that is getting into the lungs, and therefore into the blood. A low level of oxygen in the blood causes the pulmonary arteries to constrict (become narrower). Because these vessels are narrower, the blood is squeezed into a smaller space, increasing the blood pressure and resulting in pulmonary hypertension.\nA foreign object, usually a blood clot, blocking or obstructing a vein, may sometimes cause pulmonary hypertension.\nWhen a blood clot blocks one of the blood vessels supplying your lungs, this is called a&nbsp;pulmonary embolism. After a pulmonary embolism, up to&nbsp;two in 100 people may have pulmonary hypertension.\nOther, less common, causes of pulmonary hypertension include:&nbsp;\n- sarcoidosis&nbsp;– a condition that causes inflammation (swelling) of different organs, including the lungs and lymph nodes\n- histiocytosis X – a condition that causes swelling in the blood vessels in the lungs\n- compression of the blood vessels in the lungs, for example by a tumour\nIt can be difficult to diagnose pulmonary hypertension because the symptoms are similar to other conditions affecting the heart or lungs. This means there can be a delay of up to three years before you are correctly diagnosed.&nbsp;\nHowever, as pulmonary hypertension can be a serious condition, it is important that you see your GP if you experiencing any symptoms. Your GP will ask about:\n- your symptoms and how these are affecting your life\n- your family history, as some types of pulmonary hypertension run in families\n- whether you are currently taking any medication&nbsp;\n- whether you have any other medical conditions\nSeveral tests may be used to either diagnose pulmonary hypertension or identify an underlying condition that may be causing it. These may be carried out by your GP, or you may be referred to a hospital to have the tests done there.\nAn echocardiogram is a type of ultrasound scan that can be used to see how well your heart is working. An ultrasound is a procedure that uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of part of the inside of your body, such as your heart. This can be used to estimate the pressure in your pulmonary arteries.\nAn electrocardiogram (ECG) is a test that records the rhythm and electrical activity of your heart. Small stickers called electrodes are stuck to your arms, legs and chest and connected with wires to an ECG machine.\nEvery time your heart beats, it produces tiny electrical signals. The ECG machine traces these signals onto paper.\nMore about having an ECG\nAn X-ray&nbsp;is an imaging technique that uses high-energy radiation to show up abnormalities in bones and certain body tissue.\nA chest X-ray can be used to look for other causes of your symptoms &#8211; for example, scarring in your lungs can also cause shortness of breath. A chest X-ray can also check if your heart is larger than normal &#8211; pulmonary hypertension makes the right-hand side of your heart work harder, causing it to become enlarged.\nLung function tests, also called breathing tests, assess how well your lungs work. These tests measure how quickly you can move air in and out of your lungs, how much air they can hold and how well they transfer oxygen into and remove carbon dioxide from your blood.\nThe tests require you to breathe in and out of a lung function machine, and the information collected will help to diagnose different lung diseases.\nExercise tests involve carrying out some form of exercise while checking your symptoms. For example, you may need to walk for six minutes, either on a treadmill or up and down a corridor, while your heart rate and blood pressure are monitored. This can be useful in determining any underlying causes for your symptoms.\nA ventilation scan measures the amount of air and the blood flow in your lungs. This can be used to look for blood clots in your vessels that may be causing pulmonary hypertension.\nA sample of blood may be taken and tested to rule out other conditions.\nThe tests above may all suggest pulmonary hypertension, but the diagnosis is only confirmed by measuring the blood pressure in:\n- the right ventricle (lower chamber) of your heart, which pumps blood to the lungs\n- your pulmonary arteries, which carry blood from the right side of your heart to your lungs\nYour blood pressure is measured in a procedure called right-heart catheterisation.\nIn right-heart catheterisation, a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is inserted into a vein in your neck, arm or groin. This catheter is fed through into the right side of your heart and into your pulmonary arteries. As well as measuring the blood pressure, the catheter can be used to measure:\n- the amount of blood the right-hand side of your heart is pumping out to your lungs&nbsp;\n- the pressure your heart must work against to get blood to your lungs (pulmonary vascular resistance)\n- the amount of oxygen in the blood that returns to your heart\nIf the pressure in your pulmonary arteries is above a certain level, you will be diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension.\nIf the above diagnostic tests reveal an underlying cause, you will be diagnosed with a particular type of pulmonary hypertension. If no cause is found, you will be diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension.\nIf your pulmonary hypertension is caused by an underlying condition, your treatment will focus on tackling it. If the cause is treated early, it may be possible to prevent permanent damage to your pulmonary arteries (the blood vessels supplying your lungs).&nbsp;\nIf you have pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), you will be referred for treatment at a centre that specialises in PAH. There&nbsp;is&nbsp;one centre&nbsp;in Scotland at the Golden Jubilee National Hospital&nbsp;in Clydebank.\nA number of different medicines can be used to treat PAH and other types of pulmonary hypertension. You will usually be started on conventional therapy or background therapy, and your treatment will then be changed or increased as necessary. Further treatment is called targeted therapy.\nBackground therapy includes:\n- anticoagulant medicines&nbsp;\n- diuretics&nbsp;\n- oxygen\n- digoxin\nThese are explained in more detail below.\nPAH can increase your risk of venous thromboembolism, which is when a blood clot forms in a vein and then breaks free. The clot can become trapped in a blood vessel, blocking the vessel and the blood supply. If this blocks one of the blood vessels supplying your lungs, this is called a pulmonary embolism.\nAnticoagulant medicines reduce the ability of the blood to clot. Taking anticoagulants, such as warfarin, may therefore reduce your risk of venous thromboembolism.\nThese medicines can cause side effects, such as increased bleeding, so you will be carefully monitored while&nbsp;taking them.\nDiuretic medicines are used to remove excess fluid from the body by increasing the production and flow of urine. Diuretics may be used in pulmonary hypertension to treat any fluid retention and swelling (oedema). This can occur if pulmonary hypertension starts to cause&nbsp;heart failure (when your heart struggles to pump blood around your body).\nPossible diuretics that may be used include:\n- furosemide\n- amiloride\n- spironolactone\nDiuretics can cause some side effects, such as:\n- mild tummy upset\n- postural hypotension&nbsp;– when your blood pressure drops suddenly after movement –&nbsp;for example, feeling dizzy after standing up&nbsp;\n- a dry mouth&nbsp;\n- rashes\n- headaches\n- confusion\nDiuretics can also disrupt your levels of electrolytes (minerals in your blood, such as potassium) and affect your kidney function. Because of this, your kidneys and blood will be monitored while you are taking diuretics.\nIf you have low oxygen levels in your blood, you may need to be treated with oxygen. This involves inhaling air that has a higher amount of oxygen in it than normal. This increases the amount of oxygen in your blood and should improve your symptoms.&nbsp;\nIf your pulmonary hypertension leads to heart failure, you may be treated with digoxin. This&nbsp;increases the strength of your heart muscle contractions and can slow down your heart rate.\nCalcium channel blockers are medicines normally used to treat&nbsp;high blood pressure (hypertension). They work by relaxing the muscles that make up the walls of your arteries. This widens your arteries and reduces your blood pressure.\nPossible calcium channel blockers include:\n- nifedipine&nbsp;\n- diltiazem\nCalcium channel blockers may work for people with idiopathic PAH (PAH with no known cause), but the effect in other types of PAH is less clear.\nYou will need a vasoreactivity test to find out if calcium channel blockers will be suitable for you. This involves taking some of the medication and then checking the blood pressure in your pulmonary arteries to see if it has fallen. If it has, you may be prescribed calcium channel blockers.\nIf calcium channel blockers were not suitable for you, or if they are no longer effective, further treatments can be tried. These are called targeted therapies and include the following medicines:\n- bosentan\n- sildenafil\n- iloprost\n- epoprostenol\nThese are explained in more detail below.\nBosentan tablets may be taken to improve your symptoms and your ability to exercise. You usually take two tablets twice a day (in the morning and evening), although the dose can vary.\nYou may spend a day in hospital starting treatment and should then be able to return home and carry on taking the medicine. If after 8-16 weeks your condition has not improved (or has got worse), you may be given additional treatment as well as or instead of bosentan.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nBosentan can increase the levels of some enzymes in the liver, which can lead to liver damage. Enzymes are proteins that speed up and control chemical reactions in the body, such as digestion. Because of this, your liver will need to be monitored once a month for as long as you are taking bosentan.\nBosentan will not be suitable for you if you:\n- already have a problem with your liver&nbsp;\n- are taking ciclosporin (a medicine that suppresses your immune system)\n- are pregnant\nWomen who could get pregnant must use contraception if they are taking bosentan. Bosentan can interact with hormonal contraception, such as the combined contraceptive pill, so it is better to use an alternative method, such as condoms.\nSildenafil tablets are usually taken three times a day to improve your ability to exercise.\nYou may spend a day in hospital starting treatment and should then be able to return home and carry on taking the medicine. How long you can take sildenafil for will depend on your condition. If at any time your condition gets worse, you may be given additional treatment as well as or instead of sildenafil.\nSildenafil may not be suitable for you if you:\n- are also taking medicines or drugs that contain nitrates&nbsp;– organic nitrates are often used to treat&nbsp;angina, and amyl nitrate is a recreational drug commonly known as &#8216;poppers&#8217;\n- have a severe problem with your liver&nbsp;&nbsp;\n- have recently had a&nbsp;heart attack or&nbsp;stroke\n- have severe&nbsp;low blood pressure&nbsp;\n- have certain eye conditions\nIloprost is inhaled through a nebuliser. This is a device that turns the liquid medicine into a mist that you breathe into your lungs. You may need to take iloprost around six to nine times a day.&nbsp;Each dose&nbsp;can take up to&nbsp;10 minutes to inhale.\nYou will need to stay in hospital for up to three days to be trained in using the nebuliser and to monitor your response. After this time, you should be able to return home and keep taking the medicine yourself.\nHow long you need to take iloprost for will depend on your condition. You may need to continue taking it, possibly alongside other treatments, until your condition worsens and you need epoprostenol (see below).\nIloprost may not be suitable if:\n- you have a&nbsp;peptic ulcer\n- you have recently&nbsp;had a&nbsp;heart attack or&nbsp;stroke\n- your pulmonary hypertension is caused by pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (a rare condition that causes high blood pressure in the lungs)\n- your pulmonary hypertension is unstable, with advanced right heart failure\nEpoprostenol – its full name is&nbsp;epoprostenol sodium – may be used if you do not respond to other treatments. Epoprostenol needs to be given through an intravenous infusion, which means a constant drip of medicine goes through a narrow tube into a vein in your arm.\nTreatment with epoprostenol will begin in hospital. It may take one or two weeks to find the correct dose for you. After this time, it is possible, with special training and equipment, for you or your carer to learn how to take this medicine yourself at home.\nOnce you have started taking epoprostenol, you may not be able to stop. Coming off epoprostenol can cause your pulmonary hypertension to rapidly return, so you may need to take epoprostenol for the rest of your life. This is why epoprostenol is considered last, after other treatments have not worked or if&nbsp;your condition has got worse.&nbsp;\nEpoprostenol may not be suitable for you if you have heart failure caused by a problem with the left side of your heart, or if you have or develop pulmonary oedema (fluid on the lungs).\nFor severe pulmonary hypertension, a heart-lung transplant may be a treatment option. This involves transplanting the healthy heart and lungs from a donor into you. However, because of a shortage of donors, these are rarely carried out. There are probably&nbsp;fewer than 10 heart-lung transplants a year in the UK.\nRead more on heart-lung transplants."

        "disease": "Phobias",
        "description": "A phobia is a type of anxiety disorder that is more than simple fear.\nMany people are afraid of things. Fear only becomes a phobia when you begin to organise your life around avoiding the thing that frightens you.\nIf you have a phobia, you&#8217;ll have an overwhelming need to avoid all contact with the source of your anxiety. Coming into contact with the thing you are afraid of will cause you to feel anxiety and/or panic. Sometimes just thinking about the thing can cause these feelings.\nPhobias can be caused by many things, including:\n- animals\n- objects\n- places\n- situations\nIf the cause of your phobia is an object or animal that you do not see regularly, it&#8217;s unlikely to affect your day-to-day life. But, if you encounter the cause of your phobia regularly, you may find it very difficult to lead a normal life.\nAlthough there are many different phobias, they can be divided into 2 categories:\nSimple phobias are fears about specific objects, animals, situations or activities. Some common examples include:\n- dogs (cynophobia)\n- spiders (arachnophobia)\n- snakes (ophidiophobia)\n- enclosed spaces (claustrophobia)\n- dentists (dentophobia)\n- flying (aerophobia)\nSimple phobias affect different people in different ways. Some people only react with mild anxiety when confronted with the object of their fear. Others experience severe anxiety or have a severe panic attack.\nComplex phobias tend to be more disabling than simple phobias. This is because they&#8217;re often associated with a deep-rooted fear or anxiety about a particular circumstance or situation.\nSpeaking to a GP about your anxiety may help to identify a complex phobia.\nTwo common examples of complex phobias are agoraphobia and social phobia.\nAgoraphobia is a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult, or where help wouldn&#8217;t be available if things go wrong.\nAgoraphobia often involves a combination of several interlinked phobias. Someone with agoraphobia may also fear being left alone (monophobia), or places where they feel trapped (claustrophobia).\nThis means someone with agoraphobia may find it difficult to:\n- travel on public transport\n- visit a shopping centre\n- leave home (in extreme cases)\nThe symptoms experienced by agoraphobics vary in severity. Some people feel very apprehensive and anxious if they have to leave their home to visit the shops. Others may feel relatively comfortable travelling a short distance from their home.\nIf you have social phobia, you may experience fear of:\n- being in social situations, like weddings\n- performing in social situations, like public speaking\n- leaving home because of the risk of meeting people (in extreme cases)\nIf you have a social phobia, the thought of being seen in public or appearing at social events can make you feel very anxious and frightened. These situations can make you feel vulnerable.\nIntentionally avoiding meeting people in social situations, like at a dinner party, is a sign of social phobia.\nPhobias are the most common type of anxiety disorder. In the UK, an estimated 10 million people have phobias. Phobias can affect anyone, regardless of age, sex and social background.\nPeople with phobias usually need to avoid contact with the thing that causes fear. How far someone with a phobia will go to avoid contact varies considerably.\nFor example, someone with a fear of spiders (arachnophobia) may not want to touch a spider, while someone else may not be able to even look at a picture of one.\nThis means that all phobias can limit your daily activities and may cause severe anxiety and depression.\nPanic attacks are common among people with phobias. They can be very frightening and distressing. The symptoms often occur suddenly and without warning.\nAs well as overwhelming feelings of anxiety, a panic attack can cause physical symptoms including:\n- sweating\n- trembling\n- hot flushes or chills\n- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing\n- a choking sensation\n- rapid heartbeat (tachycardia)\n- chest pain or a feeling of tightness in the chest\n- a sensation of butterflies in the stomach\n- nausea\n- headaches and dizziness\n- feeling faint\n- numbness or pins and needles\n- dry mouth\n- a need to go to the toilet\n- ringing in your ears\n- feeling confused or disorientated\nIn severe cases, you may also experience psychological symptoms such as:\n- fear of losing control\n- fear of fainting\n- feelings of dread\n- fear of dying\nPhobias usually develop during childhood, adolescence or early adulthood. They often begin after a frightening event or a stressful situation. But, it is not always clear why some phobias occur.\nPhobias are not passed on genetically (running in families). If people in your family share your phobia, it is likely that you all learnt it from another family member as children.\nMost people with a phobia are usually fully aware that they have one. Many people live with a phobia without having it formally diagnosed and by taking care to avoid the thing they are afraid of.\nWhatever type of phobia you have, you may benefit from speaking to your GP. They may refer you to a mental healthcare specialist, like a psychologist or psychiatrist, who can help.\nAlmost all phobias can be successfully treated and cured.\nTreating simple phobias involves gradually becoming exposed to the animal, object, place or situation that causes fear. This is known as desensitisation or self-exposure therapy.\nEach phobia is different and no single programme will work for everyone. You may decide to get help from a mental healthcare specialist, like a psychologist, or to use your own self-help strategy.\nOur mental health self-help guides are based on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). They&#8217;ve proven highly successful in helping people with anxiety and other mental health issues.\nTreating complex phobias often takes longer and involves talking therapies, such as counselling, psychotherapy and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Speak to your GP for further information about treating a complex phobia.\nMedication is not usually used to treat phobias. However, it&#8217;s sometimes prescribed to help people cope with the effects of anxiety. The medication used may include:\n- antidepressants\n- tranquilisers\n- beta-blockers"

        "description": "There are around 7000 known rare conditions, with new conditions being discovered every year.\nIn Scotland, around 400,000 people are affected by a rare condition. This means that about 1 in 17 people will be affected by a rare condition at some point in their lives.\nSome rare conditions are more common but many only affect a small number of people. Some extremely rare conditions may only affect a handful of people in the whole world.\nA rare condition is one that affects less than 1 in 2000 people.\nMost rare conditions are chronic. This means they are a long-term condition that often has to be managed throughout a person&#8217;s life.\nMost symptoms of a rare condition start in childhood. These can often be managed with treatment.\nOver time, individuals&nbsp;will also learn about managing their own health and wellbeing. This means many people with a rare condition will be able to live&nbsp;active and fulfilling lives.&nbsp;\nThere are many different types of rare condition. Most are genetic but some are acquired (non-genetic conditions).\nRare conditions can be diagnosed before birth, during childhood or later in life.\nIt can be challenging to diagnose a rare condition. This means that many patients experience a long journey to get a diagnosis. Dealing with this uncertainty can be frustrating and unsettling.\nSometimes a condition is so rare that it may not be possible to diagnose.\nIf you think you may be affected by a rare condition, you should discuss this with your GP practice. They may refer you to specialist services and recommend genetic testing.\nHealthcare professionals will request different tests depending on your symptoms. These may include&nbsp;blood tests,&nbsp;x-rays&nbsp;or&nbsp;scans. They may also consider genetic testing.\nMost rare conditions are genetic (about 80%).\nA genetic condition is sometimes passed through one or both parents to their child. Some genetic conditions also&nbsp;happen in a family for the first time and may not be inherited from a parent.\nThere are lots of types of genetic testing but&nbsp;a blood test&nbsp;is usually used.&nbsp;Your genetic team will explain any tests that are relevant to your condition in more detail.\nSome tests aim to find changes in genes or chromosomes (the packages for your genes).\nGenetic testing is always advancing so new conditions are being diagnosed every year.\nIf it&#8217;s thought that you could have a rare genetic condition, you may be referred to a genetic centre. They can provide specialist counselling about genetic testing.\nIn Scotland, there are 4 regional genetic centres. These have expertise in rare genetic conditions. These are based in:\n- Glasgow\n- Aberdeen\n- Dundee\n- Edinburgh\nLiving with a rare condition can be overwhelming and frightening. But, you&#8217;re not alone and support is available.\nIf you&#8217;re struggling to get a diagnosis, don&#8217;t give up. You should continue to reach out to your healthcare professionals. Remember, it&#8217;s ok to ask questions about your healthcare.\nIf you have a rare condition, it&#8217;s important to maintain a healthy and active lifestyle.\nThe symptoms of a rare condition can worsen if you also have a common condition like:\n- diabetes\n- obesity\n- high blood pressure\nYour GP practice can offer advice about healthy living.\nFurther information on healthy living\nIn NHS Scotland, there are some networks and services for specific conditions. These provide information and support for healthcare professionals, patients and their families.\nFurther information about specialist services\nFurther information about specialist networks\nSupport groups and charities can be a good source of help and information. If there&#8217;s not a specific support group for your condition, you might find a more general&nbsp;group helpful.\nGenetic Alliance UK&nbsp;supports people with rare, undiagnosed and genetic conditions. They can direct you to relevant information and support for your rare condition.\nRare Resources Scotland has information for people living with rare conditions in Scotland. It also supports their families and healthcare professionals.\nSWAN UK is run by Genetic Alliance UK. It&#8217;s a support network for families affected by a condition that doesn&#8217;t have a name.

        "disease": "Rare tumours",
        "description": "More children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.\nIt’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming, but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.\nUnderstanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. Your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information, and if you have any questions it’s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.\nRare cancers in children make up fewer than 1 in 30 of all childhood cancers and can broadly be grouped as:\n- rare cancers that only affect children, such as pancreatoblastoma, malignant rhabdoid tumours and melanotic neuroectodermal tumours of infancy\n- cancers that usually only affect adults, such as cancers of the digestive system, the thyroid and the adrenal gland\n- rare cancers in the head and neck area, such as nasopharyngeal cancer\n- rare hormonal/endocrine cancers, such as phaeochromocytoma\n- rare brain tumours, such as meningioma\n- rare skin cancers, such as melanomas\nThe causes of most rare childhood cancers are unknown. But if other family members have had particular types of cancer, this may sometimes suggest that there is an inherited faulty gene in the family. If this is a possibility, your child’s specialist will talk to you about it.\nRare cancers are treated with the same treatments used for other childhood cancers. This includes surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Your child may need a combination of these treatments.\nUsually an operation is done to remove all or as much of the cancer as possible. Other treatments, such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy, may be given after or sometimes before surgery. They may also be used if an operation is not possible.\nRadiotherapy&nbsp;uses high-energy rays to destroy the cancer cells, while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. It can be used to treat any cancer cells that may be left behind after surgery, or to shrink a cancer.\nChemotherapy&nbsp;is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells. It is usually given as injections and drips (infusions) into a vein. Chemotherapy may be used to lower the risk of the cancer coming back or to treat cancer that has spread to other parts of the body.\nClinical trials are usually not available as the number of children with rare cancers is so small. The&nbsp;Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group&nbsp;(CCLG) aims to improve the care and treatment of children with cancer and it develops guidelines on the best ways of treating and managing those with rare tumours. Doctors communicate with specialist colleagues in other countries to promote research in rare tumours and develop new forms of treatment.\nAs a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time.\nYour child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience of cancer.\nFurther information and advice if your child has cancer"

        "disease": "Raynaud’s phenomenon",
        "description": "Raynaud’s phenomenon is a common condition that affects the blood supply to certain parts of the body – usually the fingers and toes.\nIt&#8217;s often referred to as Raynaud’s syndrome, Raynaud’s&nbsp;disease or just Raynaud&#8217;s.\nRaynaud’s is usually triggered by cold temperatures, anxiety or stress. The condition occurs because your blood vessels go into a temporary spasm, which blocks the flow of blood.\nThis causes the affected area to change colour to white, then blue and then red, as the bloodflow returns.&nbsp;You may also experience numbness, pain, and pins and needles.\nSymptoms of Raynaud&#8217;s can last&nbsp;from a few minutes to several hours.\nIIt&#8217;s not&nbsp;a serious threat to your health, but can be painful and difficult to live with. If can affect your ability to move your fingers and hands.&nbsp;People with Raynaud’s often go for long periods without any symptoms, and sometimes the condition goes away altogether.\nOther parts of the body that can be affected by Raynaud’s include the ears, nose, nipples and lips.\nIn many cases, it may be possible to control the symptoms of Raynaud’s yourself by avoiding the cold, wearing gloves and using relaxation techniques when feeling stressed.\nStopping smoking can also improve symptoms, as smoking can affect your circulation.\nIf you&#8217;re unable to control your symptoms yourself, then a medication called nifedipine may be recommended.\nRead more about treating Raynaud’s.\nThere are two types of Raynaud&#8217;s:\n- primary – when the condition develops by itself (this is the most common type)\n- secondary – when it&#8217;s caused by&nbsp;another health condition\nMost cases of secondary Raynaud’s are associated with conditions that cause the immune system to attack healthy tissue (autoimmune conditions), such as scleroderma&nbsp;and lupus.\nThe causes of primary Raynaud’s&nbsp;are unclear. However&nbsp;1 in 10 people with primary Raynaud’s goes on to develop a condition associated with secondary Raynaud’s, such as lupus.\nYour GP can help to determine whether you have primary or secondary Raynaud&#8217;s&nbsp;by examining your symptoms and carrying out blood tests.\nRead more about what causes Raynaud’s&nbsp;and diagnosing Raynaud&#8217;s.\nSecondary Raynaud’s can severely restrict the&nbsp;blood supply, so it carries a higher risk of complications, such as ulcers, scarring and even&nbsp;tissue death (gangrene) in the most serious cases. However, severe complications are rare.\nRead more about the complications of Raynaud’s.\nRaynaud’s phenomenon is a common condition. It affects up to 20% of the adult population worldwide. There may be as many as 10 million people with the condition in the UK.\nPrimary Raynaud’s usually begins in your 20s or 30s. Secondary Raynaud’s can develop at any age, depending on the cause.\nRaynaud&#8217;s is slightly more common in women than men.\nRaynaud&#8217;s phenomenon is the result of over-sensitive blood vessels in the body&#8217;s extremities. In many cases, no cause is identified, although it&#8217;s sometimes linked to other health conditions.\nWhen your body is exposed to cold temperatures, the extremities, such as your fingers and toes, lose heat. This is because the small blood vessels under the skin spasm, slowing down the blood supply that is helping to preserve your body&#8217;s core temperature.\nIn people with Raynaud&#8217;s, the sensitive blood vessels overreact to cold temperatures and become narrower than usual, significantly restricting the blood flow.\nSymptoms can be triggered by mildly cool weather, getting something out of the freezer, or running your hands under a cold tap. Strong emotions such as&nbsp;stress or anxiety may also trigger symptoms.\nThe most common form of Raynaud&#8217;s is primary Raynaud&#8217;s phenomenon. This means the condition occurs by itself, without being associated with another health condition.\nIt seems that&nbsp;primary Raynaud’s is caused by disruptions in how the nervous system controls blood vessels. Exactly what causes these disruptions is unclear.\nThere&#8217;s some evidence that primary Raynaud’s may be an inherited condition, as cases have been known to run in families.\nIn some cases, an underlying&nbsp;health condition could&nbsp;be causing the blood vessels to overreact. This is called secondary Raynaud&#8217;s.\nThe majority of cases of secondary Raynaud’s are associated with autoimmune conditions, which cause the immune system to attack healthy tissue.\nAutoimmune conditions known to be associated with secondary Raynaud’s include:\n- scleroderma – a condition that causes hardening and thickening of the skin\n- rheumatoid arthritis – which causes joint pain and swelling\n- Sjogren&#8217;s syndrome – where the immune system attacks the body’s sweat and tear glands\n- lupus – which causes tiredness, joint pain and skin rashes\nAround&nbsp;1 in 10 people with primary Raynaud’s go on to develop an autoimmune condition.\nBlood-born viral infections, hepatitis B and hepatitis C, can occasionally trigger Raynaud’s in some people.\nSome types of cancer can cause secondary Raynaud’s. These are&nbsp;usually cancers that develop inside the blood, bone marrow or immune system, such as:\n- acute lymphoblastic leukaemia – a cancer of the white blood cells that mainly affects children\n- lymphoma – a cancer that develops inside one or more of the glands that are part of the immune system\n- multiple myeloma – a cancer that develops inside bone marrow\nSecondary Raynaud&#8217;s can also be a side effect of taking certain medicines, including:\n- some types of anti-migraine medication – such as sumatriptan and ergotamine\n- beta-blockers – which are used to treat high blood pressure and heart disease\n- some chemotherapy medicines\n- decongestants&nbsp;\n- the contraceptive pill \n- medicines used in&nbsp;hormone replacement therapy\n- some types of medicines used&nbsp;to treat&nbsp;high blood pressure&nbsp;\nIllegal drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines, can also cause secondary Raynaud’s.\nRaynaud&#8217;s sometimes results from a physical injury. It can also affect musicians, people who type a lot, or other people who use their fingers and hands more than usual.\nSkin and tissue damage caused by&nbsp;frostbite can also lead to Raynaud&#8217;s.\nSmoking cigarettes also increases your risk of developing Raynaud&#8217;s. Read&nbsp;about the support available to help you quit smoking.\nVibration white finger is a term used when secondary Raynaud&#8217;s has been caused by vibration. This typically happens to people who regularly use certain types of vibrating tools, such as:&nbsp;\n- sanders, grinders and disc cutters\n- hammer drills\n- chainsaws, hedge trimmers and power mowers\nAny vibrating tool that causes tingling or numbness in your fingers could lead to vibration white finger.\nYour employer has a responsibility to protect you from vibration white finger. If the job can&#8217;t be done without vibrating tools:\n- ask to use suitable low-vibration tools\n- make sure you&#8217;re using the right tool for the job\n- check tools are properly maintained\n- keep&nbsp;cutting tools sharp\n- reduce the amount of time you use the tool in one go by doing other jobs in between\n- keep warm at work\n- wear anti-vibration gloves\n- store tools&nbsp;indoors, so they don&#8217;t have cold handles when next used\n- encourage your blood circulation by keeping warm, stopping smoking and massaging and exercising your fingers during your breaks\nIf you&#8217;re diagnosed with the condition, tell your employer as soon as possible. If you stop using vibrating tools at an early stage, you may recover fully.\nBy law, your employer must contact the Health and Safety Executive about your condition. You may be entitled to an Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit, which is a payment given to people who have become ill or injured as a result of their work.\nSee the GOV.UK website for more information about the Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit.\nRaynaud&#8217;s phenomenon can usually be diagnosed after an examination of your symptoms and some blood tests.\nYour GP may place your hands in cold water or cool air to see if you show symptoms of Raynaud’s.\nFurther testing is usually recommended to find out whether you have primary or secondary Raynaud’s.\nSecondary Raynaud’s may require more treatment and, in some cases, referral to a specialist.\nSecondary Raynaud’s may be suspected if:\n- your symptoms only started when you were over 30 years of age – most cases of primary Raynaud’s begin between the ages of 20 to 30\n- you&#8217;re experiencing severe pain during an attack of Raynaud’s\n- only one side of your body is affected\nYour GP may also check the tiny blood vessels, known as capillaries, found where your nail meets the finger. These capillaries are often&nbsp;larger in people with secondary Raynaud’s, and look like red pen marks.\nYour GP may also refer you for blood tests to check for other health conditions&nbsp;that could be causing your symptoms. These tests may include:\n- a full blood count –&nbsp;to check for&nbsp;infection or, much less commonly, a cancer of the blood, such as leukaemia\n- an antinuclear antibodies (ANA) test –&nbsp;to&nbsp;check for an&nbsp;overactive immune system, which is common in people with autoimmune conditions such as scleroderma&nbsp;and lupus\n- erythrocyte sedimentation rate –&nbsp;to check for an autoimmune disorder\nIf you&#8217;ve been diagnosed with Raynaud’s, Scleroderma &amp; Raynaud&#8217;s UK (SRUK) may be helpful.\nIt is the UK’s leading charity for people affected by the condition.\nYou can usually treat Raynaud&#8217;s phenomenon yourself, although medication is sometimes necessary.\nIf you&#8217;ve been diagnosed with secondary Raynaud’s, you may be referred to a specialist in the treatment of the underlying condition.\nIf your secondary Raynaud’s may be a side effect of a medication, you may be asked to stop taking it, to see if your symptoms improve.\nThe following advice is recommended for&nbsp;both primary and secondary Raynaud’s.\n- Keep your whole body warm, especially your hands and feet. Wear gloves and warm footwear in cold weather.\n- If you smoke, stop. Quitting smoking will improve your circulation, which should help to improve symptoms.\n- Exercise regularly, as this helps to improve your circulation and reduce stress levels (see below). For most people, 150 minutes of vigorous exercise a week is recommended. Read more about exercise.\n- Try to minimise your stress levels. Regular exercise, eating a healthy diet, and relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or activities such as yoga, can help. You may find it useful to avoid stimulants such as coffee, tea and cola.\nIf you find it difficult to control feelings of stress, you may require additional treatment, such as counselling.\nIf your symptoms fail to improve, you may be prescribed nifedipine. This is the only medicine licensed to treat Raynaud&#8217;s phenomenon in the UK. It doesn&#8217;t cure Raynaud&#8217;s, but can help to relieve the symptoms.\nNifedipine is a calcium channel blocker – a type of medication that encourages the blood vessels to widen.\nDepending on the pattern of your symptoms and how well you respond to treatment, you may be asked to take your medication every day. Alternatively, you may only need to take it as prevention; for example, during&nbsp;a sudden snap of cold weather.\nSide effects are common and include:\n- oedema – swelling of certain parts of the body, such as your hands and feet, due to a build-up of fluid\n- headaches\n- heart palpitations\n- dizziness\n- constipation\nDon&#8217;t drink grapefruit juice when taking nifedipine, as this could make side effects worse.\nThe side effects should improve as your body gets used to the medicine, but tell your GP if you find them particularly troublesome. There are alternative calcium channel blockers that may suit you better.\nOther medications have been used to treat Raynaud’s, but their use is controversial, as there is limited evidence to show they&#8217;re effective in most people. However, some people have claimed to benefit from treatment. These medications include:\n- fluoxetine – which was widely used in the treatment of depression\n- sildenafil – which is used to treat erectile dysfunction (inability to get or maintain an erection)\nThese medicines are not licensed for the treatment of Raynaud&#8217;s in the UK, but you may be prescribed them if it&#8217;s thought the potential benefit outweighs the possible risks.&nbsp;\nSurgery for Raynaud&#8217;s is rare. It&#8217;s usually only recommended if your symptoms are so severe that there&#8217;s a risk the affected body part, such as your fingers, could lose their blood supply and begin to die. Read more about the complications of Raynaud&#8217;s phenomenon.\nA type of surgery called sympathectomy is sometimes used. It involves cutting the nerves causing the affected blood vessels to spasm.\nThe results of a sympathectomy are often only temporary and further treatment and possibly more surgery may be required after a few years.\nPeople with Raynaud&#8217;s phenomenon have an increased risk of developing other problems, such as scleroderma.\nAround&nbsp;1 in 16 women and&nbsp;1 in 50 men with Raynaud’s develop a condition called scleroderma, usually between the ages of 25 and 55.\nScleroderma is when the body produces excessively high levels of collagen.\nScleroderma is a Greek word meaning hard skin, but it can affect other areas of the body, such as the kidneys, heart and lungs.\nSymptoms of scleroderma include:\n- puffy and itchy skin\n- tight and uncomfortable joints\n- small calcium spots and red spots under the skin\n- trouble swallowing, known as dysphagia\n- diarrhoea, bloating or constipation\nThere&#8217;s no cure for scleroderma, but there are ways of overcoming problems it may cause.\nFor example, medicines can reverse or slow down the processes that cause damage around the body.\nFor more information, visit Scleroderma &amp; Raynaud&#8217;s UK (SRUK), a UK charity dedicated to improving the lives of people affected by Scleroderma and Raynaud’s.\nIn severe cases of Raynaud’s, the blood supply to an affected body part can become severely diminished. Without a constant supply of blood, the tissue in the body part will begin to die. This problem is rare and normally only occurs in secondary Raynaud&#8217;s.\nThe initial sign is an open sore, known as an ulcer, which develops on the surface of the body part. If you suspect a skin ulcer, contact your GP for advice.\nLeft untreated, the tissue can die, which is known as gangrene (specifically, dry gangrene).\nThe symptoms of dry gangrene normally begin with a red line on the skin that marks the edges of the affected tissue. The tissue becomes cold and numb, and can be painful as the tissue dies. However, many people, particularly the elderly, experience no sensations.\nThe affected area changes colour from red, to brown, to black. The dead tissue will then shrivel up, separate from the healthy tissue and fall off.\nThese complications normally require admission to hospital, where you&#8217;ll be given medication designed to thin your blood, which should help to restore blood flow.\nIf you fail to respond to treatment, you may need surgery to unblock or repair damaged blood vessels."

        "disease": "Reactive arthritis",
        "description": "Reactive arthritis causes inflammation (redness and swelling) in different parts of the body.\nIt usually develops after an infection. In most cases it clears up in a few months without causing long-term problems.\nReactive arthritis can occur at any age, but it often affects young adults aged between 20 to 40. Men are generally affected more than women.\nReactive arthritis is usually linked to an infection. This includes:\n- sexually transmitted infections (STIs) – like chlamydia or gonorrhoea\n- gastrointestinal infections – like food poisoning\nThe body&#8217;s immune system seems to over-react to these infections. It then starts to attack healthy tissue, leading to inflammation.\nPeople with a gene known as HLA-B27 are also more likely to develop reactive arthritis. But, it&#8217;s not clear why this is the case.\nReactive arthritis most often affects the:\n- joints and tendons – causing pain, stiffness and swelling, often in the knees, feet, toes, hips and ankles\n- eyes – causing eye pain, redness, sticky discharge, conjunctivitis and sometimes inflammation\n- urinary system – causing pain when peeing, or discharge from the penis or vagina\nMost people will not experience symptoms in all of these areas.\nReactive arthritis can also cause symptoms, including:\n- feeling unusually tired\n- a high temperature (fever)\n- weight loss\n- mouth ulcers\n- painless white patches inside your mouth\n- a rash\n- thick and crumbly nails\n- abdominal (tummy) pain\n- diarrhoea\nThere&#8217;s no single test for reactive arthritis. But, different tests may be used to check for infection and rule out other reasons for your symptoms. This includes:\n- blood tests\n- urine tests\n- genital swabs\n- X-rays\n- samples of fluid from a joint or joints\n- stool sample\nYour GP will also want to know about your recent medical history. For example, whether you may have recently had a bowel infection or an STI.\nThere is no cure for reactive arthritis but the condition is usually temporary.\nSymptoms can often be controlled using:\n- non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\n- painkillers like ibuprofen\nSevere symptoms may need to be manged with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).\nAntibiotics don&#8217;t treat reactive arthritis itself. But, you may be prescribed antibiotics to treat an infection like an STI.\nOnce your symptoms improve, it&#8217;s also helpful to begin some gentle exercise. Focus on strengthening the muscles and improving the range of motion in joints.\nSpeak to a healthcare professional about exercises for you. You may be referred to a physiotherapist.\nSTIs are a common cause of reactive arthritis. To help prevent this, you should always use a barrier method of contraception during sex. For example, a condom.\nFurther information on contraception"

        "disease": "Recurrent miscarriage",
        "description": "Recurrent miscarriage is when you&#8217;ve experienced 3 or more early miscarriages.\nRead more about early miscarriages\n3 or more early miscarriages refers to the total number of early miscarriages you&#8217;ve had. It does not matter if you&#8217;ve had a successful pregnancy in-between miscarriages. The miscarriages do not need to happen one after the other.\nMost of the time there’s no clear reason why a miscarriage happens. It’s unlikely to be caused by anything you did or did not do.\nRead more about the causes of a miscarriage\nIf you&#8217;ve had 3 or more miscarriages, you may be offered tests or investigations. These can help medical professionals understand why you&#8217;re experiencing recurrent miscarriage.\nThe tests you may be offered can include:\n- 2 blood tests for antiphospholipid syndrome\n- a blood test to check your thyroid function\n- a test for diabetes\n- tests for PCOS and prolactin imbalance\n- a scan of your uterus to check its shape\nYou and your partner may also be offered genetic tests. These can check for inherited chromosomal conditions.\nYou may not be offered all of these tests. Medical professionals will advise which are clinically appropriate for your circumstances.\nIt&#8217;s not always possible to work out exactly what is going wrong. The most likely outcome is that medical professionals will not be able to find a specific reason for your losses.\nIt can be difficult to be told that your recurrent miscarriages are unexplained. You may feel hopeless, especially if there&#8217;s nothing you can treat or change next time.\nMost people who have had 3 unexplained miscarriages do go on to have a healthy pregnancy.\nRecurrent miscarriage can feel very hard to bear.

        "disease": "Restless legs syndrome",
        "description": "Restless legs syndrome, also known as Willis-Ekbom disease, is a common condition of the nervous system. It causes an overwhelming, irresistible urge to move the legs.\nAs many as 1 in 10 people are affected by restless legs syndrome at some point in their life.\nWomen are twice as likely to develop restless legs syndrome than men. It’s also more common in middle age, although the symptoms can develop at any age, including childhood.\nRestless legs syndrome typically causes an overwhelming urge to move your legs. It also causes an uncomfortable sensation in your legs, which can affect your arms, chest and face.\nThis sensation has been described as:\n- tingling, burning, itching or throbbing\n- a &#8216;creepy-crawly&#8217; feeling\n- feeling like fizzy water is inside the blood vessels in the legs\n- a painful, cramping sensation in the legs, particularly in the calves\nThese unpleasant sensations can range from mild to unbearable. They&#8217;re usually worse in the evening and during the night. The sensation can often be relieved by moving or rubbing your legs.\nSome people experience symptoms occasionally, while others have them every day. You may find it difficult to sit for long periods of time, like on a long train journey.\nUp to 80% of people with restless legs syndrome also have periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS).\nIf you have PLMS, your leg will jerk or twitch uncontrollably, usually at night while you’re asleep. The movements are brief and repetitive, and usually occur every 10 to 60 seconds.\nPLMS can be severe enough to wake up both you and your partner. The involuntary leg movements can also occur when you’re awake and resting.\nThere are two types of restless leg syndrome:\n- primary or idiopathic restless legs syndrome\n- secondary restless legs syndrome\nPrimary restless legs syndrome makes up the majority of restless leg syndrome cases. In these cases, there&#8217;s no obvious cause of the syndrome.\nSome researchers think it may be caused by a problem with a part of the brain called the basal ganglia. This part of the brain uses a neurotransmitter (chemical) called dopamine to help control muscle activity and movement. If the cells in your basal ganglia becomes damaged, the amount of dopamine in the brain is reduced. This causes muscle spasms and involuntary movements.\nDopamine levels naturally fall towards the end of the day. This may explain why your symptoms are often worse in the evening and during the night.\nResearch has also identified specific genes related to restless legs syndrome. This means it can run in families. In these cases, symptoms usually occur before the age of 40.\nSecondary restless legs syndrome occurs as a complication of another health condition. It can also be the result of another health-related factor.\nYou can develop secondary restless legs syndrome if you have:\n- iron deficiency anaemia\n- chronic kidney disease\n- diabetes\n- Parkinson’s disease\n- rheumatoid arthritis\n- an underactive thyroid gland\n- fibromyalgia\nYou can also develop secondary restless legs syndrome if you&#8217;re pregnant. It&#8217;s most common from 27 weeks onwards.\nThere’s no single test for diagnosing restless legs syndrome.\nA diagnosis will be based on your:\n- symptoms\n- medical history\n- family history\n- physical examination\n- test results\nYour GP should be able to diagnose restless legs syndrome.\nYou&#8217;ll be asked about the pattern of your symptoms to help assess their severity. You may also be referred for blood tests. These will confirm if you have primary or secondary restless leg syndrome.\nIf your restless legs syndrome is disrupting your sleep, you may be sent for sleep tests. These allow healthcare professionals to see exactly what happens when you&#8217;re asleep.\nThe treatment for restless legs syndrome can depend on:\n- what type of restless legs syndrome you have\n- the severity of your symptoms\nThere are triggers that don’t cause restless legs syndrome, but can make symptoms worse. These include medications like:\n- some antidepressants\n- antipsychotics\n- lithium\n- calcium channel blockers\n- some antihistamines\n- metoclopramide\nDo not stop taking any medicine that&rsquo;s been prescribed without checking with your GP or healthcare provider first. You could make yourself very ill.\nOther possible triggers include:\n- smoking\n- excessive caffeine or alcohol consumption\n- being overweight or obese\n- stress\n- lack of exercise\nIf your symptoms are mild, you may find that making a few lifestyle changes improves the syndrome.\nHaving good sleep hygiene can help restless leg syndrome. This means that you have healthy sleep habits, including:\n- following a regular bedtime ritual and taking time to relax before bed\n- sticking to the same bedtime every day\n- getting up at the same time every morning\n- avoiding naps during the day\n- avoiding stimulants like alcohol, caffeine and drugs before bed\n- avoiding exercise before bed\nOther things that may help include:\n- not smoking\n- taking regular daily exercise\nDuring an episode of restless legs syndrome, the following measures may help relieve your symptoms:\n- massaging your legs\n- taking a hot bath in the evening\n- applying a hot or cold compress to your leg muscles\n- doing activities that distract your mind, like reading or watching television\n- relaxation exercises, like yoga or tai chi\n- walking and stretching\nIf primary restless legs syndrome is causing more severe symptoms, there are medications that may help. Your GP may suggest trying dopamine agonists, painkillers, hypnotics or levodopa.\nIf your symptoms are caused by an underlying health problem, medical professionals will treat that health problem first. It may be that treating that problem will resolve the syndrome.\nIf your secondary restless legs syndrome is caused by pregnancy, your symptoms will usually stop within four weeks of giving birth."

        "disease": "Retinoblastoma: Children",
        "description": "Retinoblastoma is an uncommon eye cancer that usually affects children under 5, although it can affect children of any age. Treatment is very effective and nearly all children with retinoblastoma are cured.\nMore children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.\nIt’s devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming. There are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.\nUnderstanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. Your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information and if you have any questions it’s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.\nRetinoblastoma develops in the light-sensitive lining of the eye (called the retina).\nThere are 2 forms of retinoblastoma:\n- a&nbsp;heritable form – this is genetic or inherited; there are often tumours in both eyes (bilateral) or sometimes only in 1 eye\n- a&nbsp;non-heritable form – this is not passed on in the family; there’s 1 tumour in only 1 eye (unilateral)\nThe heritable form of retinoblastoma, which accounts for about 2 in every 5 cases, is caused by a genetic abnormality. This means that an abnormal gene allows the tumour to develop. This abnormal gene may either be inherited from a parent or happen for the first time at an early stage of development in the womb.\nGenetic counselling and support is available for families in which a member has retinoblastoma. Not all children of a parent with retinoblastoma will inherit this gene, but children born into families with a history of retinoblastoma are offered blood testing. They are also usually checked (screened) soon after birth for signs of retinoblastoma. This means that treatment can be started early if a tumour does develop.\nScreening usually starts shortly after birth and is repeated every few months for 5 years. An eye specialist examines the eye, while shining a light into it with an ophthalmoscope. In younger children, this may need to be done under a&nbsp;general anaesthetic.\nThe genetic abnormality in the heritable form of retinoblastoma is now well-understood. But we don’t know what causes non-heritable retinoblastoma.\nSome children with a family history of retinoblastoma are picked up by screening before they have any symptoms.\nIf there’s no family history of retinoblastoma, the first sign of the condition is often a white pupil that does not reflect light (leukocoria). This may be picked up when a picture of your child is taken using flash photography. The pupil of the affected eye may look white in the photograph.\nSome children may have a squint or, if the tumour is large, they may have a painful red eye.\nTests are likely to involve an examination under anaesthetic (EUA) where an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) examines your child’s eye while they’re asleep. Unlike nearly all other types of cancer, retinoblastomas can be diagnosed just by their appearance. So it’s not usually necessary to take a sample of tissue (a&nbsp;biopsy). Your child will have several more EUAs to check how treatment is progressing.\nWhen retinoblastoma is diagnosed, your child may have some other tests to check the exact position and size of the tumour, and whether it has begun to spread into surrounding structures. This is known as staging.\nThey may have some of the following tests:\n- an&nbsp;ultrasound&nbsp;scan&nbsp;– this is a painless scan that uses sound waves to examine the eye and the surrounding area\n- an&nbsp;MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan&nbsp;– this uses magnetism to build up a detailed picture of the eye and the head\n- a&nbsp;lumbar puncture – the doctor inserts a fine needle between the bones in the lower spine to remove a sample of the fluid from around the brain and spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid)&nbsp;then the fluid is examined under a microscope to check whether there are any cancer cells present\n- a&nbsp;bone marrow sample – this may be taken to check whether there are any cancer cells in the bone marrow (where our blood cells are made); the doctor inserts a needle into the hip bone and draws some of the bone marrow out with a syringe so that it can be checked for any cancer cells\n- a&nbsp;bone scan – this involves taking a series of&nbsp;X-rays&nbsp;to check for signs of any spread to the bones\n- a&nbsp;blood test – this may be taken for genetic testing for the Rb gene; the results of this test can take some months\nThe doctor or a specialist nurse will explain more about the tests that your child needs.\nThe stage of a cancer is a term used to describe its size and whether it has spread from where it first started. Knowing the stage of your child’s retinoblastoma helps the doctors to decide on the most appropriate treatment.\nThe following staging system is commonly used for retinoblastoma.\nThere is cancer in 1 or both eyes, but it has not spread to other parts of the eye or the tissues surrounding the eye. This stage may be sub-divided into 5 grades (A–E), depending on the size and position of the cancer and on whether there’s any damage to the eye.\nThe cancer has spread outside the eye into surrounding tissue, or to other parts of the body.\nTreatment depends on the number, position and size of the tumours in the eye. The aim of treatment is to first get rid of the cancer, and secondly to try to keep the sight in the eye. Some treatments may cause changes to the vision in the affected eye. Your child’s specialist will talk to you about the possible risks as well as the advantages of the treatment.\nFor smaller tumours, treatment is given to the eye itself (called local therapy), while your child is asleep and under anaesthetic.\nThis is used to freeze the tumours. More than 1 session may be necessary, in which case they are usually done at monthly intervals.\nA laser is used to heat the tumour. Your child may need a number of sessions at intervals of 3&nbsp;to 4 weeks.\nA small radioactive disc is stitched over the tumour on the outside of the eye. The disc needs to stay in place for up to 4 days while the radiation destroys the cancer cells. This is done for slightly larger tumours, or tumours that have not been successfully treated with other methods.\nThis process uses heat to destroy the cancer cells and may be combined with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, as heat can improve the effectiveness of these treatments. The heat is produced by a laser, which is directed at the tumour.\nThis is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells. It may be given before the local treatments mentioned above, to help shrink the tumour and make treatment more successful.&nbsp;Chemotherapy&nbsp;can also be used if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, or if there’s a risk that it may spread. The chemotherapy drugs most commonly used to treat retinoblastoma are carboplatin, etoposide, and vincristine.\nNewer techniques include giving chemotherapy directly into the artery (the blood vessel) that supplies the eye (intra-arterial chemotherapy) or injecting chemotherapy into the central gelatinous part of the eye (intra-vitreal chemotherapy).\nIf the tumour is very large and the vision in the eye is lost, your child is likely to need an operation to remove the eye. The specialist will only do this if it is absolutely necessary. An artificial eye is then fitted.\nRadiotherapy&nbsp;treats cancer by using high energy rays from a machine to destroy the cancer cells, while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. It can be given to the whole eye but does have some effect on the surrounding tissue. Radiotherapy for retinoblastoma is normally only used when other treatments have not worked well.\nThe side effects will depend on the treatment your child is having. The immediate side effects will usually improve when treatment finishes. But unfortunately, some treatments may cause side effects that develop many years later. The specialist will explain all of this to you before treatment starts. Your child’s follow-up will include checking for any long-term effects of treatment.\nMany children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. Specialist doctors carry out trials for children’s cancers.\nIf appropriate, your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial, and will answer any questions you have. Written information is provided to help explain things.\nTaking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide whether it’s right for your child.\nSometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child’s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The&nbsp;Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group&nbsp;(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.\nAt least 9 out of every 10 children with retinoblastoma are cured. Following treatment, the eye specialist will frequently examine your child’s eye under anaesthetic to check that the retina is healthy, the cancer has not come back, and no new tumours have developed. Follow-up is usually in a clinic for childhood cancers, called a paediatric oncology clinic.\nChildren with heritable retinoblastoma will be given genetic counselling when they are old enough to understand it.\nHaving the heritable form of retinoblastoma means an increased risk of developing other types of cancer later in life. Your child will be followed up closely into adulthood. They will be encouraged to get any new symptoms, such as a lump, checked early, and to have a healthy lifestyle to help to reduce cancer risk.\nAs a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time.\nYour child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer.\nFurther information and advice if your child has cancer"

Your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information and if you have any questions it is important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.\nSarcomas are rare types of tumour that develop in the supporting tissues of the body, such as bone, muscle or cartilage. There are 2 main types of sarcomas:\n- soft tissue sarcomas can develop in muscle, fat, blood vessels, or in any of the other tissues that support, surround and protect the organs of the body\n- bone sarcomas can develop in any of the bones of the skeleton\nRhabdomyosarcoma is the most common of soft tissue sarcomas in children. These tumours develop from muscle or fibrous tissue and can grow in any part of the body.\nThe most common areas of the body to be affected are around the head and neck, bladder, testes, womb, or vagina.\nSometimes tumours are also found in a muscle or a limb, in the chest or in the abdominal wall. If the tumour is in the head or neck area, it can occasionally spread into the brain or the fluid around the spinal cord.\nThe causes of rhabdomyosarcoma are unknown but research is going on all the time. Children with certain rare genetic disorders, such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome, have a higher risk of developing rhabdomyosarcoma.\nThe most common symptom is a lump or swelling. Other symptoms will depend on the part of the body that’s affected by the rhabdomyosarcoma:\n- a&nbsp;tumour in the head or neck area can sometimes cause a blockage (obstruction) and discharge from the nose or throat; occasionally, an eye may appear swollen and protruding\n- a&nbsp;tumour in the abdomen (tummy) can cause pain or discomfort in the abdomen and difficulty going to the toilet (constipation)\n- a&nbsp;tumour in the bladder may cause symptoms such as blood in the urine and difficulty passing urine (peeing)\nDifferent tests are usually needed to diagnose a rhabdomyosarcoma.

Treatment will depend on the size of the tumour, its position in the body and whether it has spread.\nThe 3 main types of treatment for soft tissue sarcomas are chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy. Your child may have a combination of treatments.\nChemotherapy&nbsp;is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells. It can be given:\n- to shrink the tumour before surgery\n- after surgery to reduce the risk of rhabdomyosarcoma coming back\nThe drugs used and the length of treatment depends on the type and stage of the rhabdomyosarcoma.\nIf it is possible, your child will have an operation to remove all or as much as possible of the tumour, without damaging surrounding tissue or organs. The operation will depend on the size of the tumour and where it is in your body. The surgeon will explain what is involved. Chemotherapy is usually given before surgery to shrink the tumour and make it easier to remove with surgery. If an operation isn’t possible, both chemotherapy and radiotherapy are given.\nRadiotherapy&nbsp;treats cancer by using high energy rays, which destroy the cancer cells while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. It may be given after surgery to the area where the rhabdomyosarcoma started.\nThe side effects will depend on the treatment being given and the part of the body that is being treated. Your child’s doctor will discuss this with you before treatment starts. Most side effects are short-term (temporary) and gradually disappear once treatment stops.\nChemotherapy may cause side effects such as feeling sick,&nbsp;hair loss,&nbsp;tiredness, and an increased risk of infection. But it can also make your child feel better by relieving any symptoms the tumour is causing.\nRadiotherapy can make your child feel tired, and the skin in the area that’s being treated may go red or get darker. Other side effects will depend on the area of the body that is being treated. Your child’s specialist doctor or nurse will explain this.\nA small number of children may develop long-term side effects many years after treatment for rhabdomyosarcoma. This depends on the type of treatment your child had. Your child’s doctor or nurse will talk to you about any possible risk of late side effects. Follow-up for children who’ve had cancer includes close monitoring for any signs of any late effects.\nLate effects may include a possible reduction in bone growth, infertility, a change in the way the heart and the kidneys work, and a slight increase in the risk of developing another cancer in later life.\nMany children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial.

        "description": "Rheumatoid arthritis is a long-term condition. It can cause:\n- pain\n- swelling\n- stiffness in the joints\nIt can also cause deformity of the joints.\nIt normally affects the hands, wrists and feet. But, other joints and parts of the body are sometimes also affected.\nRheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition. This means it&#8217;s caused by the body&#8217;s immune system attacking itself.\nThe immune system helps to defend our body from infections. But, in rheumatoid arthritis the immune system sends antibodies to the lining of the joints by mistake. The antibodies then attack the tissues surrounding the joint. This causes the thin layer of cells (synovium) covering the joints to become sore and inflamed.\nInflammation also causes chemicals to be released. These chemicals thicken the synovium and damage the:\n- bones\n- cartilage – the stretchy connective tissue between bones\n- tendons – the tissue that connects bone to muscle\n- ligaments – the tissue that connects bone and cartilage\nThe chemicals can also change the shape of the joint over time.\nThe symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis vary from person to person. They can come and go, and may change over time.\nSymptoms of rheumatoid arthritis that affect the joints include:\n- pain\n- swelling\n- stiffness and difficulty moving affected joints\n- redness\n- heat around the joints\nIn some people, firm swellings called rheumatoid nodules also develop under the skin around affected joints.\nSome people with rheumatoid arthritis can experience other symptoms. This includes:\n- tiredness and lack of energy\n- a high temperature (fever)\n- sweating\n- a poor appetite\n- weight loss\nRheumatoid arthritis can be difficult to diagnose. This is because many conditions cause joint stiffness and inflammation.\nYou should speak to your GP if you think you have symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. They will ask about your symptoms and carry out a physical examination to:\n- check your joints for any swelling\n- look at how easily your joints move\nYou GP may also arrange blood tests.\nIf your GP thinks that you have rheumatoid arthritis, they will refer you to a specialist (Rheumatologist). The Rheumatologist will arrange to meet you to go over your history and examine your joints. They may need to arrange extra tests, like more blood tests or scans, before they can make a diagnosis and decide if treatment is needed. These will:\n- check for joint inflammation and damage\n- show what kind of arthritis you have\nThere&#8217;s no cure for rheumatoid arthritis but with treatment the joint pain, swelling and stiffness will improve and the risk of joint damage can be reduced.\nDifferent types of medications can be used to treat rheumatoid arthritis to relieve joint pain, stiffness and swelling. This will also reduce the chance of developing joint damage.\nThe two main types of medication are:\n- disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs)\n- biologic treatments\nThey usually need to be taken for a long-time. They are most effective when started early after the first symptoms.\nYou may also need other medication to relieve the joint pain and stiffness.. For example:\n- painkillers\n- non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\n- corticosteroids\nYou may be offered other treatments to help your rheumatoid arthritis symptoms. This includes:\n- physiotherapy – helps improve muscle strength, flexibility and fitness\n- occupational therapy – provides training and advice if you need help with everyday tasks or are having difficulty at work\n- podiatry – helps if you have problems with your feet\nIf you have rheumatoid arthritis, surgery is sometimes needed to:\n- improve movement in your joint\n- reduce pain\n- correct damage to the shape of the joint\nSurgery for rheumatoid arthritis includes:\n- finger, hand and wrist surgery – there are different types to correct problems in this area\n- arthroscopy – a procedure to remove inflamed joint tissue\n- joint replacement surgery – surgery to replace part or all of a joint\nSome people with rheumatoid arthritis try complementary therapies like:\n- massage\n- acupuncture\n- osteopathy\n- chiropractic\nRheumatoid arthritis can be hard to deal with because the symptoms are unpredictable.\nSome days the pain and stiffness will be worse than others and there&#8217;s no way of knowing when a flare-up will occur. This may mean that some people develop stress, anxiety or depression. It can also cause fear, frustration and anger.\nYou should speak to a healthcare professional if you&#8217;re struggling to deal with your condition.\nThe National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society (NRAS) website has information about living with rheumatoid arthritits.\nYou can also phone the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society (NRAS) helpline on 0800 298 7650. It&#8217;s Monday to Friday, 9.30am to 4.30pm.

        "disease": "Ringworm and other fungal infections",
        "description": "Ringworm is a common fungal infection that can cause a red or silvery ring-like rash on the skin. Ringworm commonly affects arms and legs, but it can appear almost anywhere on the body. Despite its name, ringworm doesn&#8217;t have anything to do with worms.\nOther similar fungal infections can affect the scalp, feet, groin and nails. These fungal infections, medically known as &#8216;tinea&#8217;, are not serious and are usually easily treated. However,&nbsp;they are&nbsp;contagious and easily spread.\nThere are different types of tinea fungal infection, based on the affected area of the body:\n- ringworm&nbsp;(tinea corporis) – affecting the body\n- fungal nail infection (onychomycosis) – affecting the nails\n- athlete&#8217;s foot (tinea pedis) – affecting the feet\n- jock itch (tinea cruris) – affecting the groin\n- tinea capitis – affecting the scalp\nRingworm usually looks like a round, red or silvery patch of skin that may be scaly, inflamed and itchy, but other fungal infections may present themselves slightly differently. Read more about the symptoms of ringworm and other tinea fungal infections.\nSee your GP if you or your child has a fungal scalp infection, as it’s treated with antifungal tablets, which are only available on prescription. Symptoms of a fungal scalp infection include small patches of scaly scalp skin (which may be sore), patchy hair loss and itchiness. Other types of fungal infections (including ringworm) are generally treated with antifungal cream from the pharmacy, and you don&#8217;t need to see a doctor unless it persists. However, pharmacists often prefer children to see a GP to confirm a diagnosis.\nFungal spores are passed between people through direct skin contact and by sharing objects such as towels, hairbrushes and bedding. Athlete’s foot is commonly spread in gym and swimming pool changing rooms.\nPets, such as dogs and cats, can have ringworm, and you can catch it by stroking them.\nRead more about the causes of ringworm.\nIt&#8217;s estimated that 10% to 20% of people will have&nbsp;ringworm in their lifetime.\nAlthough children are more likely to get this, people of all ages can be affected.\nGroin infections are more common in young men.\nFungal scalp infections (tinea capitis) are most common in children who have not reached puberty, particularly African-Caribbean children and those who live in urban areas.\nMost ringworm infections are mild and can be treated using a pharmacy antifungal cream. Scalp infections can be treated with antifungal tablets, sometimes combined with antifungal shampoo. If the skin is irritated or broken, it can lead to other bacterial infections, which may need treatment with antibiotics. Read more about how to treat fungal infections.\nIt&#8217;s important to prevent the infection spreading. You should avoid sharing towels, bedding or clothes with someone with a fungal infection. If you think your pet has ringworm, take it to the vet. If your pet is treated quickly, you’ll be less likely to catch it. If your child has a fungal infection, they can go to school, but you should inform their teacher. In addition to treatment, your child should maintain a good level of personal hygiene to prevent the infection spreading. Read more about how to stop the spread of fungal infections.\nThe symptoms of a tinea fungal infection depend on where the infection is.\nThe symptoms of ringworm include:\n- a ring-like red or silvery rash on your skin – your skin will look red and irritated around the ring, but healthy inside\n- scaly, itchy and inflamed skin\nIn more severe cases:\n- the rings may multiply, grow in size and merge together\n- the rings may feel slightly raised and the skin underneath may be itchy\n- blisters and pus-filled sores may form around the rings\nThe ring spreads outwards as it progresses. You can have one patch or several patches of ringworm, and in more serious cases, your skin may become raised and blistered.\nRingworm&nbsp;on the face and neck may not appear ring-shaped, but may be itchy and swollen, and it can become dry and crusted. If you have a beard, you may notice patches of hair breaking away.\nRingworm on the hand often causes the skin to become thicker on the palm and in between the fingers. It may affect one hand or both and normally only appears on one side.\nThe symptoms of a fungal scalp infection include:\n- small patches of scaly skin on the scalp, which may be sore\n- patchy hair loss\n- an itchy scalp\nIn more severe cases:\n- small, pus-filled sores on the scalp\n- crusting on the scalp\n- bald patches (if your hair is affected)\nIn very severe cases, a large inflamed sore called a kerion may form on your scalp. This can ooze pus, and you may also have a fever and swollen lymph glands.\nThe main symptom of athlete’s foot is an itchy, dry, red and flaky rash, usually in the spaces between your toes. In more severe cases, you may have:\n- cracked skin in the affected area\n- blisters, which may ooze or crust\n- swelling of the skin\n- a burning or stinging sensation in your skin\n- scaling patterns around your sole, between your toes and on the side of your foot\nThe symptoms of jock itch include:\n- red-brown sores, which may have blisters or pus-filled sores around the edge\n- itchiness and redness around your groin area, such as your inner thighs and bottom (the genitals are not usually affected)\n- scaly, flaky skin on your inner thighs\nExercising, walking and wearing tight clothing or underwear can make the symptoms of a groin infection worse.\nThe symptoms of a fungal nail infection include:\n- a whitish thickening of the nail\n- discolouration (the nail can turn white, black, yellow or green)\n- the nail can become brittle and start to fall off\n- the skin around the nail may be sore and irritated\nRead more about fungal nail infection\nMake an appointment to see your GP if you:\n- or your child develop the symptoms of a fungal scalp infection\n- have ringworm that has not improved after two weeks of treatment with antifungal cream\n- have another medical condition, or you’re having medical treatment that is known to weaken your immune system, such as chemotherapy or steroid tablets\nRead more about how fungal infections are diagnosed.\nTinea fungal infections are caused by a particular type of fungi, called dermatophytes, which live off keratin. Keratin is a tough, waterproof tissue found in many parts of your body, including your skin, hair and nails. This explains why fungal infections mostly affect your skin, scalp or nails.\nThe fungi are tiny spores tough enough to survive for months on your skin, in soil or on household objects, such as combs or towels. They thrive in heat and moisture, which helps them to grow and explains why they are often spread in swimming pool changing rooms and communal showers. The spores can be spread in four different ways:\n- human-to-human contact\n- human-to-animal contact – for example, by stroking an infected dog or cat\n- human-to-object contact – both animals and humans can leave traces of fungi spores on objects and surfaces, such as towels, clothing, bed linen, combs or brushes\n- human-to-soil contact – less commonly, it can develop after lengthy exposure to infected soil\nAs an adult, you can become a carrier of a scalp infection without developing any symptoms. This is because your body has usually developed a defence against the infection by the time you reach adulthood. If you’re a carrier of a fungal infection, you can unknowingly pass the condition on to children, who may then go on to develop symptoms.\nYou are more likely to develop a fungal infection if you:\n- are very young or very old\n- are African-Caribbean (in the case of scalp infections)\n- have type 1 diabetes\n- are very overweight (obese)\n- have a medical condition that weakens your immune system, such as HIV or AIDS\n- are receiving medical treatment that weakens your immune system, such as chemotherapy or steroid tablets\n- have had fungal infections in the past\n- have hardened arteries (atherosclerosis)\n- have poor circulation (specifically, a condition called venous insufficiency, where the veins in your legs have trouble moving blood back to your heart)\nRingworm and other tinea fungal infections are usually easy to diagnose from their appearance and location.\nYour GP will usually be able to diagnose a scalp infection after examining your scalp. Knowing exactly which fungus is causing the infection is useful, because some antifungal medications are better at treating certain types. Your GP will take a small scraping of skin from your scalp to test in a laboratory. You may be given an antifungal medication before you receive your test results. If the tests show that a different antifungal medication would work better, you will be prescribed that instead.\nMost fungal infections can be diagnosed by your GP after examining your skin and asking whether you have other related symptoms. Further tests will usually only be needed if your symptoms are severe or if they fail to respond to antifungal treatment. If this happens, your GP may take a small scraping of affected skin for analysis in a laboratory. Microscopic analysis will show if fungi are present and the specific type that is causing your infection. Read about how to treat ringworm and other fungal infections.\nMost tinea fungal infections, including ringworm, are easily treated by using antifungal creams, tablets or shampoo. You can also help to get rid of fungal infections and stop them from spreading by:\n- washing areas of affected skin daily and drying thoroughly, paying particular attention to skin folds and between your toes\n- in the case of a groin or foot infection, changing your underwear or socks daily, because fungi can persist in flakes of skin\n- with a scalp infection, not sharing combs, hairbrushes or hats\n- washing clothes, towels and bed linen frequently\n- wearing loose-fitting clothes, preferably made of cotton or other natural materials\nRead more about preventing ringworm.\nMost cases of ringworm, groin infections and athlete’s foot can be treated using an over-the-counter antifungal cream, gel or spray. There are lots of different types, so ask your pharmacist to help you choose the right one for you. You usually apply antifungal creams, gels and sprays daily to the affected areas of skin for 2 weeks. The cream, gel or spray should be applied over the rash and to one inch of skin beyond the edge of the rash. Read the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions first. You may be advised to use the treatment for a further 2 weeks, to reduce the risk of re-infection. See your GP if your symptoms have not improved after 2 weeks of treatment, because you may need to take antifungal tablets. Both terbinafine and griseofulvin tablets can be used to treat ringworm infections, as well as another antifungal medicine called itraconazole.\nGroin infections can sometimes occur at the same time as athlete&#8217;s foot. It&#8217;s vital to treat both infections at the same time to avoid being re-infected with either condition.\nScalp infections are usually treated using antifungal tablets, often alongside an antifungal shampoo. There are 2 main types of antifungal tablet:\n- terbinafine\n- griseofulvin\nThe antifungal medicine that your GP prescribes will depend on the type of fungi causing the infection.\nMost people with fungal scalp infections are prescribed terbinafine tablets to take once a day for 4 weeks. It&#8217;s an effective treatment for most cases. Side effects of terbinafine can include:\n- nausea\n- diarrhoea\n- indigestion\n- rashes\nThese side effects are usually mild and short-lived. Some people have also reported that terbinafine temporarily affected their sense of taste.\nTerbinafine is not suitable for people with a history of liver disease or lupus (where the immune system attacks healthy tissue).\nGriseofulvin is a type of antifungal medicine that prevents fungi from growing and multiplying. It’s available in the form of a spray and is usually taken daily for 8 to 10 weeks. Side effects of griseofulvin can include:&nbsp;\n- nausea\n- vomiting\n- mild diarrhoea\n- headache\n- indigestion&nbsp;\nHowever, these side effects should improve as your body gets used to the medicine. Griseofulvin can cause birth defects, so it shouldn&#8217;t be taken during pregnancy, or if you intend to become pregnant soon after stopping treatment. Men shouldn&#8217;t father a child within 6 months of stopping treatment. Griseofulvin is also not suitable for women who are breastfeeding, and those with severe liver disease or lupus. Griseofulvin can interfere with both the combined contraceptive pill and the progestogen-only pill, so women need to use an alternative barrier form of contraception, such as a condom, while taking it. Griseofulvin may also affect your ability to drive and can enhance the effects of alcohol.\nAntifungal shampoo cannot cure scalp infections, but it can help to prevent the infection spreading and may speed up recovery. Antifungal shampoos, such as selenium sulphide and ketoconazole shampoo, are available from your pharmacist. Ideally, antifungal shampoo should be used twice a week during the first 2 weeks of treatment. There is no evidence that shaving a child&#8217;s head will reduce the risk of an infection or speed up recovery.\nItraconazole is usually prescribed in the form of capsules for 7 or 15 days. It is not recommended for use in children, elderly people or those with severe liver disease. Side effects of itraconazole can include:\n- nausea\n- vomiting\n- indigestion\n- diarrhoea\n- headache\nRead about how to stop ringworm spreading or coming back.\nFungal nail infections can be treated with antifungal nail paint, but it also often requires antifungal tablets. These tend to work better than nail paints, although they can cause side effects, such as headache, nausea and diarrhoea. Read more about treating fungal nail infections.\nThe following advice will help to stop fungal infections from spreading. The fungi that cause tinea infections can survive on items such as furniture, hairbrushes, clothing and towels, and can be spread through contact with these items. Therefore, if someone in your household has a fungal infection, you should:\n- avoid sharing personal items – such as combs, hairbrushes, towels, clothing and bed linen\n- avoid scratching the affected areas of your skin or scalp, because it could spread the infection to other parts of your body\nIt’s important that other household members check themselves for signs of infection and get treatment if necessary. If you suspect that your pet is the source of the infection, take them to your vet for treatment. Patches of missing fur is a sign that an animal has ringworm. Always wash your hands after touching a pet with the infection. If someone in your family has a fungal infection, there is no need for them to stay off work or school. However, treatment should be started as soon as possible. Good personal hygiene should also be followed to stop it spreading to other children. Wearing something on your feet in gym and swimming pool changing rooms will reduce your chances of getting athlete’s foot. Find out how to treat fungal infections."

        "disease": "Rosacea",
        "description": "Rosacea is a common but poorly understood long-term skin condition that mainly affects the face.\nIt can be controlled to&nbsp;some degree with long-term treatment, but sometimes the changes in&nbsp;physical appearance can have&nbsp;a significant psychological impact.\nSymptoms often begin with episodes of flushing,&nbsp;where the skin turns red for a short period, but other symptoms can develop as the condition progresses, such as:\n- burning and stinging sensations\n- permanent redness\n- spots (papules and pustules)\n- small blood vessels in the skin becoming visible\nRosacea is a relapsing condition, which means there are periods when symptoms are particularly bad, but less severe at others.\nRead about the symptoms of rosacea\nSee your GP if you have persistent symptoms that could be caused by rosacea. Early diagnosis and&nbsp;treatment can help stop the condition getting worse.\nThere&#8217;s no specific test for rosacea, but your GP will often be able to diagnose the condition by:\n- examining your skin\n- asking about your symptoms\n- asking about possible triggers you may have\nIn some circumstances your GP may arrange further tests&nbsp;to rule out other conditions with similar symptoms, such as lupus&nbsp;or the menopause. For example, these could be a blood test&nbsp;or&nbsp;skin biopsy, where a small scraping of skin is removed and examined.\nThe exact&nbsp;cause of rosacea is unknown, although a number of possible factors have been suggested, including abnormalities in the blood vessels of the face and a reaction to microscopic mites commonly found on the face.\nAlthough they&#8217;re not thought to be direct causes of the condition, several triggers have been identified that may make rosacea worse.\nThese include:\n- exposure to sunlight\n- stress\n- strenuous exercise\n- hot or cold weather\n- hot drinks\n- alcohol and caffeine\n- certain foods, such as spicy foods\nRead about causes of rosacea\nThere&#8217;s currently no cure for rosacea, but treatment can help control the symptoms.\nLong-term treatment&nbsp;is usually necessary, although there may be periods when your symptoms improve and you can stop treatment temporarily.\nFor most people, treatment involves a combination of self-help measures and medication, such as:\n- avoiding known triggers – for example, avoiding drinks containing alcohol or caffeine\n- creams and gels – medications applied directly to the skin to reduce spots and redness\n- oral medications – tablets or capsules that can&nbsp;help clear up more severe spots, such as oral antibiotics\nIn some cases procedures such as laser and intense pulsed light (IPL) treatment may be helpful.&nbsp;These involve&nbsp;beams of light&nbsp;being aimed at the visible blood vessels in the skin to shrink them and make them less visible.\nRead about more about&nbsp;treating rosacea&nbsp;and&nbsp;self-help measures for rosacea\nAny long-term (chronic) condition can have an adverse psychological effect, but rosacea can be particularly troublesome&nbsp;as it affects your appearance. This can change how you feel about yourself and how you interact with others.\nMany people with rosacea have reported feelings of low self-esteem, embarrassment and frustration.\nIt&#8217;s important to try to come to terms with the fact you have a chronic condition that, although incurable, is controllable.\nPersevering with your treatment plan and avoiding your individual triggers are the best ways of controlling your symptoms.\nAs your physical symptoms improve, you&nbsp;may start to feel better psychologically and emotionally.\nIf you have rosacea, take comfort in knowing you&#8217;re not alone. There are millions of people living with the condition&nbsp;in the UK and across the world.\nYou can find support and information from organisations like:\n- Changing Faces&nbsp;– a charity for people with a visible difference or facial disfigurement, who can be contacted on&nbsp;0300 012 0275 for counselling and advice\nSpeak to your GP if you&#8217;re feeling&nbsp;depressed as a result of your condition. They may recommend further treatment if necessary.\nRosacea that affects your eyes (ocular rosacea) can lead to a number of eye problems, some of which can be serious.\nSymptoms of ocular rosacea can include:\n- feeling like there is something in your eyes\n- dry eyes\n- irritated and bloodshot eyes\n- inflammation of the eyelids (blepharitis)\nRosacea can sometimes cause the cornea, the transparent layer at the front of the eyeball, to become inflamed and damaged. This is known as keratitis.\nThis damage can make the cornea vulnerable to ulceration and infection, which could potentially threaten your sight.\nSymptoms of serious problems with your corneas include:\n- eye pain\n- sensitivity to light (photophobia)\n- deterioration in your vision\nContact your GP immediately if you think you may have a problem with your corneas. If this isn&#8217;t possible, visit your nearest accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department.\nIf keratitis isn&#8217;t treated promptly by an ophthalmologist, a doctor who specialises in treating eye conditions, there&#8217;s a risk of permanent vision loss.\nRosacea causes a range of symptoms, although not everyone will experience them all.\nMost people with rosacea have periods when their symptoms are particularly troublesome, followed by periods&nbsp;when their symptoms are less so.\nThe main symptoms of rosacea include:\n- flushing\n- persistent facial redness\n- visible blood vessels\n- papules and pustules\n- thickened skin\nThese are discussed in more detail below.\nOther symptoms associated with rosacea include:\n- sensitive skin&nbsp;– burning, itching, stinging and&nbsp;pain\n- dry, rough skin\n- raised red patches (plaques) on your skin\n- facial swelling (lymphoedema)\nPermanent damage to the face (scarring) almost never occurs in rosacea.\nFlushing&nbsp;is when your skin turns red for a short period&nbsp;– usually a few minutes. It tends to mainly affect the face, although it can spread to your neck and chest.\nIn some cases the redness may be accompanied by an unpleasant feeling of heat.\nIn rosacea flushing&nbsp;is often caused by a certain trigger, such as sun exposure, hot drinks or exercise. See&nbsp;causes of rosacea for more information about possible triggers.\nPersistent facial redness (erythema) is&nbsp;like&nbsp;a blush or a patch of sunburn that doesn&#8217;t go away, or the sort of blotchy skin often associated with drinking too much alcohol.\nThis can be upsetting for those with rosacea as people can mistakenly assume they are heavy drinkers.\nThe redness usually affects the cheeks, nose and chin, but may spread to other areas, such as the forehead, neck and chest.\nOver time the blood vessels in the skin may become permanently widened&nbsp;(dilated) and visible. The medical name for visible blood vessels is telangiectasia.\nIf you have rosacea, you may develop round red bumps that rise from your skin (papules) and pus-filled swellings&nbsp;(pustules).\nThese spots appear on your face and are similar to acne. Rosacea used to be called acne rosacea, but the 2&nbsp;conditions are quite different.\nIn rosacea there are no blackheads&nbsp;and&nbsp;the skin is not greasy, but dry and peeling. Rosacea spots also don&#8217;t cause scarring.\nIn the most serious cases of rosacea the skin can thicken and form excess tissue, usually around the nose. This causes the nose to take on a large, bulbous appearance (rhinophyma).\nRhinophyma is an uncommon,&nbsp;severe&nbsp;symptom of rosacea and takes several years to develop. It&nbsp;almost exclusively affects men.\nThe exact cause of rosacea is unknown, although a number of potential factors have been suggested.\nIt&#8217;s possible a combination of these factors may be responsible for the condition, although there isn&#8217;t enough evidence to say this for certain.\nSome of the main factors that have been suggested are outlined below.\nSome experts believe abnormalities in the blood vessels of the face may be a major contributing factor for rosacea. This may explain symptoms of flushing, persistent redness and visible blood vessels.\nIt&#8217;s not known what causes these abnormalities. But sun damage may be responsible for degeneration of the elastic tissue of the skin and the dilation of blood vessels.\nRecent research has shown external triggers such as ultraviolet (UV) light, spicy food, alcohol (particularly red wine), exercise, stress, heat and cold can lead to the&nbsp;activation of certain molecules within the skin called peptides.\nIncreased levels of these peptides may in turn affect the immune system or&nbsp;nerves and blood vessels&nbsp;(neurovascular system) of the skin. Activation of these systems can cause dilation of blood vessels, redness and inflammation.\nMicroscopic mites called demodex folliculorum usually live harmlessly on human skin, but people with rosacea have particularly large numbers, which may play a role in the condition.\nIt is currently uncertain whether the mite is a cause or an effect of rosacea, although some&nbsp;researchers have suggested the symptoms may be caused by the skin reacting to&nbsp;bacteria in the mites&#8217; faeces.\nHelicobacter pylori bacteria are bacteria&nbsp;found in the digestive system. It&#8217;s been suggested these bacteria may be a possible cause of rosacea, although&nbsp;a link&nbsp;hasn&#8217;t been proven.\nOne theory is the bacteria may stimulate the production of a protein called bradykinin, which is known to cause blood vessels to expand.\nRosacea seems to be more common in families, although it&#8217;s not clear which genes&nbsp;– if any&nbsp;– are involved or how they&#8217;re passed on.\nAlthough they&#8217;re not thought to be direct causes of&nbsp;the condition, many people with rosacea find certain triggers make their symptoms worse.\nDifferent people can have different triggers, but triggers that have been commonly reported include:\n- exposure to sunlight\n- stress\n- hot or cold weather\n- strong&nbsp;winds\n- strenuous exercise\n- alcohol\n- hot baths\n- spicy foods\n- hot drinks\n- humidity\n- caffeine&nbsp;– found in tea, coffee and cola\n- the menopause\n- dairy products\n- other&nbsp;medical conditions\n- certain medicines – such as amiodarone, corticosteroids and high doses of vitamins B6 and B12\nAlthough rosacea can&#8217;t be cured, treatment can help keep the symptoms under control.\nLong-term treatment is usually necessary, although there may be periods where your symptoms improve and you can stop treatment temporarily.\nTreatment choices depend on&nbsp;which type of symptom is most troublesome, but usually involves a combination of&nbsp;self-help measures and medication, and are&nbsp;outlined below.&nbsp;\nThere are a number of&nbsp;things you can do yourself to help keep the symptoms of rosacea under control, including:\n- avoiding things that trigger your symptoms – for example, by using sun cream and covering yourself up if direct sunlight makes your symptoms worse\n- taking good care of your skin – for example, by&nbsp;using&nbsp;products suitable for sensitive skin\n- using make-up –&nbsp;patches of persistent red skin can be disguised using specially designed camouflage make-up\n- keeping your eyelids clean – if rosacea is causing your eyelids to become inflamed (blepharitis)\nIf you have&nbsp;round red bumps that rise from your skin (papules) and pus-filled swellings (pustules) caused by rosacea, there are a number of different medications that can be effective.\nThese can be divided into topical treatments that are applied to the skin, or oral treatments, which are taken by mouth.\nTopical medications are usually prescribed first. These include:\n- metronidazole cream or gel\n- azelaic acid cream or gel\n- ivermectin cream\nIvermectin is a relatively new medicine. There&#8217;s some evidence to suggest it may be more effective and perhaps less irritating to the skin than metronidazole, although it&#8217;s not currently available on the NHS everywhere and may only be recommended if the other treatments don&#8217;t work.\nYou&#8217;ll usually need to apply these topical treatments once or twice a day, taking care not to get them in your eyes or mouth. It may be several weeks before you notice any significant improvement in your symptoms.\nSide effects of these treatments can include a burning or stinging sensation, itchiness and dry skin.\nIf your symptoms are more severe, an oral antibiotic medication may be recommended as these can help reduce&nbsp;inflammation of the skin.\nAntibiotics often used to treat rosacea include tetracycline, oxytetracycline, doxycycline and erythromycin.&nbsp;\nThese medications are usually taken for 4&nbsp;to 6&nbsp;weeks, but longer courses may be necessary if the spots are persistent.\nFor example, a low-dose doxycycline capsule is available if oral antibiotics need to be taken long term.\nCommon side effects of these medications include:\n- feeling and being sick\n- diarrhoea\n- bloating and&nbsp;indigestion\n- tummy (abdominal)&nbsp;pain\n- loss of appetite\nSome of the medications used can also&nbsp;make your skin sensitive to sunlight and artificial sources of light, such as sun lamps and sunbeds.\nAs with the topical treatments mentioned above, these medications usually need to be taken&nbsp;once or twice a day and you may not notice a significant improvement in your symptoms for several weeks.\nIsotretinoin is a medicine often used to treat severe acne,&nbsp;but at lower doses it&#8217;s also occasionally used to treat rosacea.\nAs isotretinoin is a strong medication that can cause a range of side effects, it can only be prescribed by a&nbsp;specialist&nbsp;in treating skin conditions (dermatologist) and not your GP.\nCommon side effects of isotretinoin include:\n- dryness and cracking of the skin, lips and nostrils\n- inflammation of your eyelids (blepharitis) or&nbsp;eyes (conjunctivitis)\n- headaches\n- muscle or&nbsp;joint pain\n- back pain\n- blood in your urine (haematuria)\n- mood changes\nIsotretinion can also cause birth defects if taken during pregnancy.\nTreating&nbsp;facial redness and&nbsp;flushing caused by rosacea&nbsp;is generally more difficult than treating papules and pustules caused by the condition.&nbsp;\nBut as well as&nbsp;the self-help measures mentioned above, there are some medications that can help.\nBrimonidine tartrate is a relatively new medication for facial redness caused by rosacea. It comes in the form of a&nbsp;gel that&#8217;s applied to the face once a day.\nThe medication works by restricting the widening (dilation) of the blood vessels in your face. Research&nbsp;has shown it can start to have an effect about 30 minutes after it&#8217;s first used, and this can last for around 12 hours.\nCommon side effects of&nbsp;brimonidine tartrate include itchiness and a burning sensation where the gel is applied.\nLess common side effects can include:\n- a dry mouth\n- headaches\n- pins and needles\n- dry skin\nA rebound effect, where flushing becomes worse, has also been reported with this medication.\nAlternatively, there are a number of oral medications that may help improve redness caused by rosacea.\nThese include:\n- clonidine&nbsp;– a medication that relaxes the blood vessels\n- beta-blockers&nbsp;– medications that decrease the activity of the heart\n- anxiety medications&nbsp;– medications sometimes used to help calm the person and reduce blushing&nbsp;\nIt&#8217;s not clear how effective these medications are at treating redness caused by rosacea, but they may sometimes be prescribed under the supervision of a dermatologist.\nRedness and visible blood vessels (telangiectasia) can also sometimes be successfully improved with vascular laser or intense pulsed light (IPL) treatment. These treatments may also improve flushing.\nA referral to a dermatologist is usually required before having these treatments and they&#8217;re not usually available on the NHS, so you may need to pay for them privately. Around 2&nbsp;to 4&nbsp;treatments may be needed, so the overall cost may be significant.\nLaser and IPL machines produce narrow beams of light that are aimed at the visible blood vessels in the skin. The heat from the lasers damages the dilated veins and causes them to shrink so they&#8217;re no longer visible, with minimal scarring or damage to the&nbsp;surrounding area.\nLaser treatment can cause pain, but most people don&#8217;t need an anaesthetic. Side effects of laser treatment are usually mild and can include:\n- bruising\n- crusting of the skin\n- swelling and redness of the skin\n- blisters&nbsp;(in rare cases)\n- infection (in very rare cases)\nThese side effects usually only last a few days and are rarely permanent.\nIn some people with rosacea the skin of the nose can become thickened. This is known as&nbsp;rhinophyma.\nIf you have severe rhinophyma, your GP may refer you to a dermatologist or plastic surgeon to&nbsp;discuss&nbsp;ways the appearance of your skin can be improved.\nA number of surgical treatments are available to remove any excess tissue and remodel the nose into a more pleasing shape.\nThis may be done with a&nbsp;laser, a scalpel or specially designed abrasive instruments using a technique called dermabrasion.\nIf rosacea&nbsp;is affecting your eyes (ocular rosacea), you may require further treatment.&nbsp;\nFor example, you may need to use lubricating eye drops or ointment if you have dry eyes, or oral antibiotics if you have blepharitis.\nIf&nbsp;initial treatment isn&#8217;t&nbsp;effective or you develop any further problems with your eyes, you&#8217;ll need to be referred to an eye specialist called an ophthalmologist for further assessment and treatment.\nIf you have rosacea, there are a number of things you can do to help keep the condition under control.\nMany people with rosacea notice certain triggers make their symptoms worse. Although it&#8217;s not always practical or possible, taking&nbsp;steps&nbsp;to avoid these triggers can&nbsp;help reduce the severity and frequency of your symptoms.\nIf you&#8217;re not sure whether your symptoms have a specific trigger, it may be useful to keep a diary to identify whether your symptoms get worse depending on things&nbsp;like the activities you do and foods or drinks you have.\nAdvice about how to avoid some common triggers can be found&nbsp;below.\nAs sunlight is the most commonly reported trigger of rosacea, you should use sun cream whenever possible, even when it&#8217;s overcast.\nA sun cream with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 is recommended. A broad-spectrum sun cream that protects against UVA and UVB light should be used.\nUsing sun creams specifically designed for children may help reduce skin irritation. Covering exposed skin with clothes or a sun hat may also help.\nTry to minimise your exposure to the sun during the summer months, particularly in the middle of the day when the sun is at its hottest.&nbsp;\nBut remember, sun can also be strong in the morning and evening, so take adequate precautions at these times as well.\nStress is also a commonly&nbsp;reported trigger of rosacea. Successfully managing your stress levels can help control your symptoms.\nWays you can reduce stress include:\n- learning relaxation techniques, such as&nbsp;deep breathing exercises, meditation and yoga\n- taking regular exercise\nAs strenuous exercise can sometimes make rosacea symptoms worse, a low-intensity exercise programme, such as walking or swimming, may be better than high-intensity activities, such as running or aerobics.\nRead about stress management.\nSome of the most&nbsp;commonly reported food- and drink-related triggers are alcohol and spicy foods. You may want to try completely removing these from your diet to see if your rosacea improves.\nBut&nbsp;there are many other dietary triggers that can also affect some people with rosacea.\nIt&#8217;s a good idea to include information about how your diet affects your rosacea symptoms in&nbsp;your rosacea diary.\nCovering your face and nose with a scarf can help protect your skin from cold temperatures and wind.\nIf you need to spend considerable time outside during cold weather, protect your face&nbsp;with a balaclava.\nThe advice below about skincare techniques may also help control your rosacea symptoms.\n- Clean your skin every morning and evening using a gentle, non-abrasive cleanser. Use soap-free cleansers with non-alkaline or neutral pH. Avoid scented soaps and alcohol-based skin cleansers\n- Rinse your face with lukewarm water and allow skin to dry thoroughly before you apply medication or make-up\n- Look for products suitable for sensitive skin. These are usually described as mild, hypoallergenic, fragrance-free and non-comedogenic (will not block pores)\n- Use a moisturiser to soothe skin if it feels sore\n- Avoid oil-based or waterproof cosmetics requiring solvents for removal. Use water-based make-up and skin products&nbsp;instead\n- Avoid astringents, toners and other facial or hair products that contain ingredients that might irritate your skin, such as fragrances, alcohol, menthol, witch hazel,&nbsp;eucalyptus oil, camphor, clove oil, peppermint, sodium lauryl sulphate and lanolin\n- You may want to avoid using anything on your skin that you aren&#8217;t sure of. You can then gradually&nbsp;reintroduce products once your symptoms have been treated and cleared to see if you can use them again without any problems\n- Men may find that using an electric razor, rather than a blade, helps reduce skin irritation\n- Some people find regular gentle facial massage reduces swelling (lymphoedema)\n- Don&#8217;t use steroid cream unless you&#8217;re specifically instructed to by your GP, as it may make your symptoms worse\nIt may be possible to disguise patches of persistent red skin using specially designed camouflage make-up.\nThe charity Changing Faces offers a skin camouflage service, available nationally and free of charge, to help with the use of these creams.\nYour GP or dermatologist can refer you to the skin camouflage service and prescribe skin camouflage make-up.\nIf your eyelids are inflamed as a result of rosacea (blepharitis), cleaning your eyelids every day with&nbsp;warm water and a small amount of cleaning solution can help ease your symptoms.\nAvoiding&nbsp;eye make-up can also help reduce your symptoms, but if you do choose to&nbsp;wear eye make-up, make sure it is a type that washes off easily so you can still clean your eyelids."

        "disease": "Scabies",
        "description": "Scabies is a contagious skin condition caused by tiny mites that burrow into the skin.\nThe main symptoms of scabies are intense itching and a rash in areas of the body where the mites have burrowed.\nThe itching is often worse at night when your skin is warmer.\nA scabies rash is made up of tiny red spots. Scratching the rash may cause crusty sores to develop.\nBurrow marks can be found anywhere on the body. These are short (1cm or less), wavy and silver-coloured lines on the skin. There&#8217;s a black dot at one end that can be seen with a magnifying glass.\nScabies usually affects the whole body, apart from the head. Some areas are more likely to be affected, including the:\n- folds of skin between fingers and toes\n- wrists\n- underarm area\n- waist\n- groin\n- bottom\nSome people may also develop a rash on their head, neck, palms and soles of the feet. This includes older people and young children.\nScabies is not usually a serious condition, but it does need to be treated.\nA pharmacist will recommend a cream or lotion that you apply over your whole body. It&#8217;s important to read the instructions carefully.\nLet the pharmacist know if you&#8217;re breastfeeding or pregnant.\nYou&#8217;ll need to repeat the treatment 1 week later.\nEveryone in your home needs to be treated at the same time, even if they do not have symptoms.\nDo not use pharmacy treatments on children under 2 years old. They will need to see a GP.\nAnyone you’ve had sexual contact with in the past 8 weeks should also be treated.\nYou should contact your local sexual health clinic if:\n- you think you have genital scabies\n- your partner has been diagnosed with genital scabies\nWhen you get to the clinic, you&#8217;ll be asked for some personal details and your sexual history. You&#8217;ll then get an examination and, if necessary, treatment.\nYou should avoid having sex and close bodily contact until you and your partner have completed a full course of treatment.\nYou may also be offered tests for STIs.\nThe 2 most common treatments for scabies are permethrin cream and malathion lotion. Both medications contain insecticides that kill the scabies mite.\nPermethrin cream is usually recommended as the first treatment. Malathion lotion is used if permethrin isn&#8217;t effective.\nTo help reduce the itchiness, you may also be given:\n- steroid cream\n- menthol cream or gel\n- antihistamines\nYou may have itchiness for a couple of weeks after your treatment has finished. This is because the immune system will still be reacting to dead mites and their droppings.\nContact your GP if you&#8217;re still experiencing itchiness 6 weeks after completing your treatment.\nYou can return to school or work after the first treatment has been completed.\nScabies is spread through direct skin contact, including sexual contact.\nIt&#8217;s unlikely that scabies will spread through brief physical contact. For example, shaking hands or hugging.\nScabies infections can spread quickly. This is because people are usually unaware they have it until 2 to 3 weeks after the initial infection.\nPeople who work closely together in confined environments are more at risk. For example, people working in schools, nurseries, nursing homes or university halls.\nScabies mites can survive outside the human body for 24 to 36 hours. This makes it possible to be infected by contaminated clothes, towels or bed linen. But, it&#8217;s rare for someone to be infected this way.\nIf you or someone in your family has scabies there are things you can do to reduce the risk of it spreading.\nScabies can sometimes lead to a secondary skin infection. This is when your skin becomes irritated and inflamed through lots of itching.\nCrusted scabies is a rare but more severe form of scabies. This is where a large number of mites are in the skin. This can develop in older people and those with a lowered immunity. It&#8217;s highly infectious.\nUnlike normal scabies, a crusted scabies rash doesn&#8217;t usually itch. In crusted scabies, the increase in the number of mites causes thick, warty crusts to develop on the skin."

        "disease": "Scarlet fever",
        "description": "Scarlet fever is a bacterial illness that mainly affects children. It causes a distinctive pink-red rash.\nThe illness is caused by Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria, also known as&nbsp;Group A Streptococcus, which are found on the skin and in the throat.\nScarlet fever usually follows a&nbsp;sore throat&nbsp;or a skin infection, like&nbsp;impetigo, caused by particular strains of Streptococcus bacteria.\nThe symptoms of scarlet fever usually develop 2 to 5 days after infection. However, the incubation period (the period between exposure to the infection and symptoms appearing) can be as short as one day or as long as 7 days.\nYou or your child:\nThe distinctive pink-red rash caused by scarlet fever develops 12 to 48 hours after symptoms like a sore throat or headache.\nRed blotches are the first sign of the rash. These turn into a fine pink-red rash that feels like sandpaper to touch and looks like&nbsp;sunburn. It may also be itchy.\nOn darker skin the rash may be more difficult to see although its rough texture should be apparent.\nThe rash usually starts on the chest and stomach, but soon spreads to other parts of the body, like the:\n- ears\n- neck\n- elbows\n- inner thighs\n- groin\nThe rash doesn&#8217;t usually spread to the face. However, the cheeks become flushed and the area just around the mouth stays quite pale. The rash will turn white if you press a glass on it.\nThe rash usually fades after about a week, but the outer layers of skin, usually on the hands and feet, may peel for several weeks afterwards.\nIn milder cases, sometimes called scarlatina, the rash may be the only symptom.\nOther symptoms of scarlet fever may include:\n- swollen neck glands\n- loss of appetite\n- nausea or vomiting\n- red lines in the folds of the body, such as the armpit, which may last a couple of days after the rash has gone\n- a white coating on the tongue, which peels a few days later leaving the tongue red and swollen (this is known as strawberry tongue)\n- a general feeling of being unwell\nIf you think you or your child may have scarlet fever, see your GP for a proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment. It usually clears up after about a week\nYour GP should be able to diagnose scarlet fever by examining the distinctive rash and asking about other symptoms. They may also decide to take a sample of saliva from the back of the throat so it can be tested in a laboratory to confirm the diagnosis.\nThere&#8217;s no evidence to suggest that catching scarlet fever when pregnant will put your baby at risk. However, if you&#8217;re heavily pregnant, tell the doctors and midwives in charge of your care if you&#8217;ve been in contact with someone who has scarlet fever.\nScarlet fever is very infectious and can be caught by:\n- breathing in bacteria in airborne droplets from an infected person&#8217;s coughs and sneezes\n- touching the skin of a person with a Streptococcal skin infection, such as&nbsp;impetigo\n- sharing contaminated towels, baths, clothes or bed linen\nIt can also be caught from people who have the bacteria in their throat or on their skin but don&#8217;t have any symptoms.\nMost cases of scarlet fever occur in children under 10 (usually between 2 and 8 years of age). However, people of any age can get the illness.\nAs it&#8217;s easily spread, scarlet fever is likely to affect someone in close contact with a person with a sore throat or skin infection caused by Streptococcus bacteria. Outbreaks can occur in nurseries and schools where children are in close contact with one another.\nThe symptoms of scarlet fever will only develop in people susceptible to toxins produced by the Streptococcus bacteria. Most children over 10 years of age will have developed immunity to these toxins.\nIt&#8217;s possible to have scarlet fever more than once, but this is rare.\nMost cases of scarlet fever clear up after about a week without treatment. However, your GP may recommend treatment as it:\n- reduces the length of time you&#8217;re infectious\n- speeds up recovery\n- lowers the risk of complications of scarlet fever\nWith treatment, most people recover in about 4 to 5 days and can return to nursery, school or work 24 hours after starting antibiotic treatment.\nWithout treatment, you&#8217;ll be infectious for 1 to 2 weeks after symptoms appear.\nScarlet fever is usually treated with a 10-day course of&nbsp;antibiotics. This is often in the form of penicillin or amoxicillin tablets, although liquid may be used for young children.\nFor people who are allergic to penicillin, alternative antibiotics like erythromycin can be used instead.\nThe symptoms usually improve within 24 hours of starting antibiotics, with the other symptoms disappearing within a few days. However, it&#8217;s important that the whole course of treatment is completed to ensure the infection is fully cleared and reduce the potential for&nbsp;antibiotic resistance.\nKeep your child away from nursery or school for at least 24 hours after starting antibiotic treatment.\nAdults with scarlet fever should also stay off work for at least 24 hours after starting treatment.\nMany of the symptoms of scarlet fever can be relieved using some simple self care measures.\nMost cases of scarlet fever don&#8217;t cause complications, particularly if the condition is properly treated.\nHowever, there&#8217;s a small risk of the infection spreading to other parts of the body and causing more serious infections, like:\n- an&nbsp;ear infection\n- a throat abscess (painful collection of pus)\n- sinusitis&nbsp;(inflammation of the sinuses)\n- pneumonia&nbsp;(inflammation of the lungs)\nVery rare complications that can occur at a later stage include:\n- bacteraemia (an infection of the bloodstream)\n- septic arthritis\n- meningitis\n- necrotising fasciitis (a severe infection involving death of areas of soft tissue below the skin)\n- Streptococcal&nbsp;toxic shock syndrome&nbsp;(rapidly progressive symptoms with low blood pressure and multi-organ failure)\nYou or child develop any of these symptoms in the first few weeks after the main infection has cleared up:\nIf your GP is closed, phone the 111 service.\nThere’s currently no vaccine for scarlet fever.\nIf your child has scarlet fever, keep them away from nursery or school for at least 24 hours after starting treatment with antibiotics. Adults with the illness should also stay off work for at least 24 hours after starting treatment.\nGPs, schools and nurseries should be aware of the current high levels of scarlet fever and inform local health protection teams if they become aware of cases, particularly if more than one child is affected."

        "disease": "Schizophrenia",
        "description": "Schizophrenia is a long-term mental health condition that causes a range of different psychological symptoms, including:\n- hallucinations&nbsp;– hearing or seeing things that do not exist\n- delusions&nbsp;–&nbsp;unusual beliefs not based on reality that often contradict the evidence\n- muddled thoughts based on hallucinations or delusions\n- changes in behaviour\nDoctors often describe schizophrenia as a psychotic illness.&nbsp;This means sometimes a person may not be able to distinguish their own thoughts and ideas from reality.\nRead more about the symptoms of schizophrenia.\nThe exact cause of schizophrenia is unknown. However, most experts believe&nbsp;the condition is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.\nIt is thought certain things make you more vulnerable to developing schizophrenia, and&nbsp;certain situations can&nbsp;trigger the condition.\nRead more about the causes of schizophrenia.\nSchizophrenia is one of the most common serious mental health conditions. About&nbsp;1 in 100 people will experience schizophrenia in their lifetime, with many continuing to lead normal lives.\nSchizophrenia is most often diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 35. Men and women are affected&nbsp;equally.\nThere is no single test for schizophrenia. It is most often diagnosed after an assessment by a mental health care professional, such as a psychiatrist.\nIt is important that schizophrenia is diagnosed as early as possible, as the chances of recovery improve the earlier it is treated.\nRead more about diagnosing schizophrenia.\nSchizophrenia is usually treated with a combination of medication and therapy&nbsp;appropriate to each individual. In most cases, this will be antipsychotic&nbsp;medicines and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).\nPeople with schizophrenia will usually receive help from a community mental health team (CMHT), which will offer day-to-day support and treatment.\nMany people recover from schizophrenia, although they may have periods when symptoms return (relapses). Support and treatment can help&nbsp;reduce the impact&nbsp;the condition has&nbsp;on your life.\nRead more about treating schizophrenia.\nIf schizophrenia is well managed, it is possible to reduce the chances of severe relapses. This can include:\n- recognising the signs of an acute episode\n- taking medication as prescribed\n- talking to others about the condition\nThere are many charities and support groups offering help and advice on living with schizophrenia. Most people&nbsp;find it comforting&nbsp;talking to others with a similar condition.\nRead more about living with schizophrenia.\nChanges in thinking and behaviour are the most obvious signs of schizophrenia, but people can experience symptoms in different ways.\nThe symptoms of schizophrenia are usually classified into one of two categories&nbsp;–&nbsp;positive or negative.\n- positive symptoms – represent a change in behaviour or thoughts, such as hallucinations or delusions\n- negative symptoms – represent a withdrawal or lack of function that you would usually expect to see in a healthy person; for example, people with schizophrenia often appear emotionless, flat and apathetic\nThe condition&nbsp;may develop slowly. The first signs of schizophrenia, such as becoming socially withdrawn and unresponsive or experiencing changes in sleeping patterns, can be hard to identify. This is because the first symptoms often develop during adolescence and changes can be mistaken for an adolescent &#8220;phase&#8221;.\nPeople often have episodes of schizophrenia, during which their symptoms are particularly severe, followed by periods where they experience few or no positive symptoms. This is known as acute schizophrenia.\nIf you are experiencing symptoms of schizophrenia, see your GP as soon as possible.&nbsp;The earlier schizophrenia is treated, the more successful the outcome tends to be.\nRead more information about how schizophrenia is diagnosed.\nA hallucination is when a person experiences a sensation but there is&nbsp;nothing or&nbsp;nobody there to account for it. It can involve any of the senses, but the most common is hearing voices.\nHallucinations are very real to the person experiencing them, even though people around them&nbsp;cannot hear the voices or experience the sensations.\nResearch using brain-scanning equipment shows changes in the speech area in the brains of people&nbsp;with schizophrenia&nbsp;when they hear voices. These studies show the experience of hearing voices as a real one, as if the brain mistakes thoughts for real voices.\nSome people describe the voices they hear as friendly and pleasant, but more often they are rude, critical, abusive or&nbsp;annoying. The voices might describe activities taking place, discuss the hearer&#8217;s thoughts and behaviour, give instructions, or talk directly to the person. Voices may come from different places or&nbsp;one place in particular, such as the television.\nA delusion is a belief&nbsp;held with complete conviction, even though it is based on a mistaken, strange or unrealistic view. It may affect the way people behave. Delusions can begin suddenly, or may develop over weeks or months.\nSome people develop a delusional idea to explain a hallucination they are having. For example, if they have heard voices describing their actions, they may have a delusion that someone is monitoring their actions.\nSomeone experiencing a paranoid delusion may believe&nbsp;they are being harassed or persecuted. They may believe they are being chased, followed, watched, plotted against or poisoned, often by a family member or friend.\nSome people who experience delusions find different meanings in everyday events or occurrences. They may believe&nbsp;people on TV or in newspaper articles are communicating messages to them alone, or that there are hidden messages in the colours of cars passing on the street.\nPeople experiencing psychosis often have trouble keeping track of their thoughts and conversations. Some people find it hard to concentrate and will drift from one idea to another. They may have trouble reading newspaper articles or watching a TV programme.\nPeople sometimes describe their thoughts as &#8220;misty&#8221; or &#8220;hazy&#8221; when this is happening to them. Thoughts and speech may become jumbled or confused, making conversation difficult and hard for other people to understand.\nA person&#8217;s behaviour may become more disorganised and unpredictable, and their appearance or dress may seem unusual to others. People with schizophrenia may behave inappropriately or become extremely agitated and shout or swear for no reason.\nSome people describe their thoughts as being controlled by someone else, that their thoughts are not their own, or that thoughts have been planted in their mind by someone else.\nAnother recognised feeling is that thoughts are disappearing, as though someone is removing them from their mind. Some people feel their body is being taken over and someone else is directing their movements and actions.\nThe negative symptoms of schizophrenia can often&nbsp;appear several years before somebody experiences their first acute schizophrenic episode. These initial negative symptoms are often referred to as the prodromal period of schizophrenia.\nSymptoms during the prodromal period usually appear gradually and slowly get worse. They include becoming more socially withdrawn and experiencing an increasing lack of care about your appearance and personal hygiene.\nIt can be difficult to tell whether the symptoms are part of the development of schizophrenia or caused by something else. Negative symptoms experienced by people living with schizophrenia include:\n- losing interest and motivation in life and activities, including relationships and sex&nbsp;\n- lack of concentration, not wanting to leave the house, and changes in sleeping patterns&nbsp;\n- being less likely to initiate conversations and feeling uncomfortable with people, or feeling there is nothing to say\nThe negative symptoms of schizophrenia can often lead to relationship problems with friends and family because they can sometimes be mistaken for deliberate laziness or rudeness.\nThe exact causes of schizophrenia are unknown, but research suggests that a combination of physical, genetic, psychological and environmental factors can make people more likely to develop the condition.\nCurrent thinking is that some people may be prone to schizophrenia, and a stressful or emotional life event might trigger a psychotic episode. However, it&#8217;s not known why some people develop symptoms while others don&#8217;t.\nThings that increase the chances of schizophrenia developing include:\nSchizophrenia tends to run in families, but no&nbsp;one gene is thought to be responsible. It&#8217;s more likely&nbsp;that different combinations of genes make people more vulnerable to the condition. However, having these genes doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean you will develop schizophrenia.\nEvidence the disorder is partly inherited comes from studies of twins. Identical twins share the same genes. In&nbsp;identical twins, if one twin develops schizophrenia, the other twin has a one in two chance of developing it too. This is true even if they are raised separately.&nbsp;\nIn non-identical twins, who have different genetic make-ups, when one twin develops schizophrenia, the other only has a one in seven chance of developing the condition.\nWhile this is higher than in the general population (where the chance is about 1 in a 100), it suggests genes are not the only factor influencing the development of schizophrenia.\nStudies of people with schizophrenia have shown there are subtle differences in the structure of their brains. These changes aren&#8217;t seen in everyone with schizophrenia and&nbsp;can occur in people who don&#8217;t have a mental illness. But they suggest&nbsp;schizophrenia may partly be a disorder of the brain.\nThese are chemicals that carry messages between brain cells. There is a connection between neurotransmitters and schizophrenia because drugs that alter the levels of neurotransmitters in the brain are known to relieve some of the symptoms of schizophrenia.&nbsp;\nResearch suggests&nbsp;schizophrenia may be caused by a change in the level of two neurotransmitters: dopamine and serotonin. Some studies indicate&nbsp;an imbalance between the two may be the basis of the problem. Others have found a change in the body&#8217;s sensitivity to the neurotransmitters is part of the cause of schizophrenia.\nResearch has shown that people who develop schizophrenia are more likely to have experienced complications before and during their birth, such as a low birth weight, premature labour, or a lack of oxygen (asphyxia) during birth. It may be that these things have a subtle effect on brain development.\nTriggers are things that can cause schizophrenia to develop in people who are at risk. These include:\nThe main psychological triggers of schizophrenia are stressful life events, such as a bereavement, losing your job or home, a divorce or the end of a relationship, or physical, sexual, emotional or racial abuse. These kinds of experiences, though stressful, do not cause schizophrenia, but can trigger its development in someone already vulnerable to it.\nDrugs do not directly cause schizophrenia, but studies have shown drug misuse increases the risk of developing schizophrenia or a similar illness.\nCertain drugs, particularly cannabis, cocaine, LSD&nbsp;or amphetamines, may trigger symptoms of schizophrenia in people who are susceptible. Using amphetamines or cocaine can lead to psychosis and can cause a relapse in people recovering from an earlier episode.\nThree major studies have shown teenagers under 15 who use cannabis regularly, especially &#8220;skunk&#8221; and other more potent forms of the drug, are up to four times more likely to develop schizophrenia by the age of 26.\nWant to know more?\n- Mind: What causes schizophrenia?\n- Rethink Mental Illness: Schizophrenia\n- Royal College of Psychiatrists: Cannabis and mental health \nThere is no single test for schizophrenia. The condition is usually diagnosed after assessment by a specialist in mental health.\nIf you are concerned&nbsp;you may be developing symptoms of schizophrenia, see your GP as soon as possible. The earlier schizophrenia is treated, the more successful the outcome tends to be.\nYour GP will ask about your symptoms and check they are not the result of other causes, such as recreational drug use.\nIf a diagnosis of schizophrenia is suspected, your GP should refer you promptly to your local community mental health team (CMHT).\nCMHTs are made up of different mental health professionals who support people with complex mental health conditions.\nA member of the CMHT team, usually a psychiatrist or a specialist nurse, will carry out a more detailed assessment of your symptoms. They will also want to know your personal history and current circumstances.\nTo make a diagnosis, most mental healthcare professionals use a diagnostic checklist. Schizophrenia can usually be diagnosed if:\n- you have experienced one or more of the following symptoms most of the time for a month&nbsp;–&nbsp;delusions, hallucinations,&nbsp;hearing voices, incoherent speech&nbsp;or negative symptoms, such as a flattening of emotions\n- your symptoms have had a significant impact on your ability to work, study or perform daily tasks\n- all other possible causes, such as recreational drug use or bipolar disorder, have been ruled out\nSometimes it might not be clear whether someone has schizophrenia. If you have other symptoms at the same time, a psychiatrist may have reason to believe you have a related mental illness.\nThere are several&nbsp;related mental illnesses similar to schizophrenia. Your psychiatrist will ask&nbsp;how your illness has affected you so they can confidently confirm you have schizophrenia and not another mental illness, such as:\n- bipolar disorder (manic depression) –&nbsp;people with bipolar disorder swing from periods of mania (elevated moods and extremely active, excited behaviour) to periods of deep depression; some people also hear voices or experience other kinds of hallucinations, or may have delusions\n- schizoaffective disorder –&nbsp;this is often described as a form of schizophrenia because its symptoms are similar to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, but schizoaffective disorder is a mental illness in its own right; it may occur just once in a person&#8217;s life or&nbsp;recur intermittently, often when triggered by stress.\nYou should also be assessed for post-traumatic stress disorder and other conditions,&nbsp;such&nbsp;as&nbsp;depression, anxiety and substance misuse.&nbsp;\nAs a result of&nbsp;their delusional thought patterns, people with schizophrenia may be reluctant to visit their GP if they believe there is nothing wrong with them.\nIt is likely&nbsp;someone who has had acute schizophrenic episodes in the past will have been assigned a care co-ordinator. If this is the case, contact the person&#8217;s care co-ordinator to express your concerns.\nIf someone is having an acute schizophrenic episode for the first time, it may be necessary for a friend, relative or other loved one to persuade them to visit their GP.\nIn the case of a rapidly worsening schizophrenic episode, you may need to go to the accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department, where a duty psychiatrist will be available.\nIf a person who is having an acute schizophrenic episode refuses to seek help, their nearest relative can request that a mental health assessment is carried out. The social services department of your local authority can advise&nbsp;how to do this.\nIn severe cases of schizophrenia, people can be compulsorily detained in hospital for assessment and treatment&nbsp;under the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 2015.\nIf you or a friend or relative are diagnosed with schizophrenia, you may feel anxious about what will happen. You may be worried about the stigma attached to the condition, or feel frightened and withdrawn.\nIt is important to remember that a diagnosis can be a positive step towards getting good, straightforward information about the illness and the kinds of treatment and services available.\nMost people with schizophrenia are treated by community mental health teams (CMHTs). The goal of the CMHT is to provide&nbsp;day-to-day support and treatment while ensuring you have as much independence as possible.\nA CMHT can be made up of and provide access to:\n- social workers\n- community mental health nurses&nbsp;– a nurse with specialist training in mental health conditions\n- occupational therapists\n- pharmacists\n- counsellors and psychotherapists&nbsp;\n- psychologists and psychiatrists&nbsp;– the psychiatrist is usually the senior clinician in the team\nAfter your first episode of schizophrenia, you should initially be referred to an early intervention team.&nbsp;These specialist teams provide treatment and support, and are usually made up of psychiatrists, psychologists, mental health nurses, social workers and support workers.\nPeople with complex mental health conditions, such as schizophrenia, are usually entered into a treatment process known as a care programme approach (CPA). A CPA is essentially a way of ensuring you receive the right treatment for your needs.\nThere are four stages to a CPA:\n- assessment – your health and social needs are assessed\n- care plan –&nbsp;a care plan is created to meet your health and social needs\n- care co-ordinator&nbsp;appointed – a&nbsp;care co-ordinator, sometimes known as a key worker, is usually a social worker or nurse, and is your first point of contact with other members of the CMHT\n- reviews –&nbsp;your treatment will be regularly reviewed and, if needed, changes to the care plan can be agreed\nNot everyone uses the CPA. Some people may be cared for by their GP, while others may be under the care of a specialist.\nYou will work together with your healthcare team to develop a care plan. The care plan may involve an advance statement or crisis plan, which can be followed in an emergency.\nYour care plan should include&nbsp;a combined healthy eating and physical activity programme and, if you smoke,&nbsp;support&nbsp;for giving up.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nYour care co-ordinator will be responsible for making sure all members of your healthcare team, including your GP, have a copy of your care plan.\nPeople who have serious psychotic symptoms as&nbsp;the result of an acute schizophrenic episode may require a more intensive level of care than a CMHT can provide.\nThese episodes are usually dealt with by antipsychotic medication and special care.\nOne treatment option is to contact a home treatment or crisis resolution team (CRT). CRTs treat people with serious mental health conditions who are currently experiencing an acute and severe psychiatric crisis. Without the involvement of the CRT, these people would require treatment in hospital.\nThe CRT aims to treat people in the least restrictive environment possible, ideally in or near their home. This can be in your own home, in a dedicated crisis residential home or hostel, or in a day care centre.\nCRTs are also responsible for planning aftercare once the crisis has passed to prevent a further crisis from occurring.\nYour care co-ordinator should be able to provide you and your friends or family with contact information in the event of a crisis.\nMore serious acute schizophrenic episodes may require admission to a psychiatric ward at a hospital or clinic. You can admit yourself voluntarily to hospital if your psychiatrist agrees it is necessary.\nPeople can also be compulsorily detained at a hospital under the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 2015. It is only possible for someone to be compulsorily detained at a hospital if they have a severe mental disorder, such as schizophrenia, and if detention is necessary:&nbsp;\n- in the interests of the person&#8217;s own health and safety\n- to&nbsp;protect others\nPeople with schizophrenia who are compulsorily detained may need to be kept in locked wards.\nAll people being treated in hospital will stay only as long as is absolutely necessary&nbsp;for them to&nbsp;receive appropriate treatment and arrange aftercare.\nAn independent panel will regularly review your case and progress. Once they feel you are no longer a danger to yourself and others, you will be discharged from hospital. However, your care team may recommend&nbsp;you remain in hospital voluntarily.\nIf it is felt there is a significant risk of future acute schizophrenic episodes occurring, you may want to write an advance statement.\nAn advance statement is a series of written instructions about what you would like your family or friends to do in case you experience another acute schizophrenic episode. You may also want to include&nbsp;contact details for your care co-ordinator.\nIf you want to make an advance statement, talk to your care co-ordinator, psychiatrist or GP.\nAntipsychotics are usually recommended as the initial treatment for&nbsp;the symptoms of an acute schizophrenic episode. They work by blocking the effect&nbsp;of the chemical dopamine&nbsp;on the brain.\nAntipsychotics can usually reduce feelings of anxiety or aggression within a few hours of use, but&nbsp;may take several days or weeks to reduce other symptoms, such as hallucinations or delusional thoughts.\nIt&#8217;s important that your doctor gives you a thorough physical examination before you start taking antipsychotics, and that you work together to find the right one for you.\nAntipsychotics can be taken orally (as a pill) or given as an injection (known as a depot). Several slow-release antipsychotics are available.&nbsp;These require you to have&nbsp;one injection every two to four weeks.\nYou may only need&nbsp;antipsychotics until your acute schizophrenic episode has passed. However, most people take medication for one or two years after their first psychotic episode to prevent further acute schizophrenic episodes occurring, and for longer if the illness is recurrent.\nThere are two main types of antipsychotics:\n- typical antipsychotics – the first generation of antipsychotics&nbsp;developed during the 1950s\n- atypical antipsychotics – newer-generation antipsychotics&nbsp;developed in the 1990s\nThe choice of antipsychotic should be made following a discussion between you and your psychiatrist about the likely benefits and side effects.\nBoth typical and atypical antipsychotics can cause side effects, although not everyone will experience them and the severity will differ from person to person.\nThe side effects of typical antipsychotics include:\n- shaking\n- trembling\n- muscle twitches\n- muscle spasms\nSide effects of both typical and atypical antipsychotics include:\n- drowsiness&nbsp;\n- weight gain, particularly with some atypical antipsychotics\n- blurred vision\n- constipation\n- lack of sex drive\n- dry mouth\nTell your care co-ordinator, psychiatrist&nbsp;or GP if your side effects become severe. There may be an alternative antipsychotic you can take or additional medicines&nbsp;that will help you deal with the side effects.\nIf you do not benefit from one antipsychotic medication after taking it regularly for several weeks, an alternative can be tried. It is important that you work with your treatment team to find the right one for you.\nDo not stop taking your antipsychotics without first consulting your care co-ordinator, psychiatrist or GP.&nbsp;If you stop taking them,&nbsp;you could&nbsp;have a relapse of symptoms.\nYour medication should be reviewed at least once a year.\nWant to know more?\n- Mind: Antipsychotics\n- Royal College of Psychiatrists: Depot medication\nPsychological treatment can help people with schizophrenia cope with the symptoms of hallucinations or delusions better. They can also help treat some of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as apathy or a lack of enjoyment.\nPsychological treatments for schizophrenia work best when they are combined with antipsychotic medication. Common psychological treatments include:\nCognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) aims to help you identify the thinking patterns that are causing you to have unwanted feelings and behaviour, and learn to replace this thinking with more realistic and useful thoughts.\nFor example, you may be taught to recognise examples of delusional thinking. You may then receive help and advice about how to avoid acting on these thoughts.\nMost people will require&nbsp;between 8 and 20 sessions of CBT over the space of&nbsp;6 to 12 months. CBT sessions usually last for about an hour.\nYour GP or care co-ordinator should be able to arrange a referral to a CBT therapist.\nMany people with schizophrenia rely on family members for their care and support. While most family members are happy to help, caring for somebody with schizophrenia can place a strain on any family.\nFamily therapy is a way of helping you and your family cope better with your condition. It involves a series of informal meetings&nbsp;over a period of around six months. Meetings may include:\n- discussing information about schizophrenia\n- exploring ways of supporting somebody with schizophrenia\n- deciding how to solve practical problems that can be caused by the symptoms of schizophrenia\nIf you think you and your family could benefit from family therapy, speak to&nbsp;your care co-ordinator or GP.\nArts therapies are designed to promote creative expression. Working with an arts therapist in a small group or individually can allow you to express your experiences with schizophrenia.\nSome people find expressing things in a non-verbal way through the arts can provide a new experience of schizophrenia and help them develop new ways of relating to others.\nArts therapies have been shown to alleviate the negative symptoms of schizophrenia in some people.\nNICE recommends&nbsp;that arts therapies are provided by an arts therapist&nbsp;registered with the&nbsp;Health and Care Professions Council who has experience of working with people with schizophrenia.\nWant to know more?\n- Mind: Understanding talking treatments\nAs well as monitoring your mental health, your healthcare team and GP should monitor your physical health.\nA healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet with lots of fruits and vegetables and regular exercise, is good for you and can reduce your risk of developing cardiovascular disease or diabetes. You should also try to avoid too much stress and get a proper amount of sleep.\nYou should have a check-up with your GP at least once a year to monitor your risk of developing cardiovascular disease or diabetes. This will include recording your weight, checking your blood pressure, and any appropriate blood tests.\nRates of smoking&nbsp;in people with schizophrenia are three times higher than in the general population. If you are a smoker, you are at a higher risk of developing cancer, heart disease and stroke.\nStopping smoking has clear physical health benefits but it has also been shown to improve the mental health of people with schizophrenia.\nResearch has shown you are up to four times more likely to quit smoking if you use NHS support as well as stop-smoking medicines, such as patches, gum or inhalators. Ask your doctor about this or phone Quit Your Way Scotland on 0800 84 84 84.\nIf you take antipsychotic medicines and want to stop smoking it&#8217;s very important that you talk to your GP and/or psychiatrist before you stop as the dosage of your prescription drugs may need to be monitored and the amount you have to take could be reduced.\nIn the course of your treatment for schizophrenia, you will be involved with many different services. Some are accessed through referral from your GP, others through your local authority. These services may include the following:\n- community mental health teams (CMHTs) – these provide the main part of local specialist mental health services, and offer assessment, treatment and social care to people living with schizophrenia and other mental illnesses\n- trained peer support – this involves the support of someone who has had schizophrenia themselves&nbsp;and is now stable, and&nbsp;may be available&nbsp;through your CMHT\n- early intervention teams – these provide early identification and treatment for people with the first symptoms of psychosis; your GP may be able to refer you directly to an early intervention team\n- crisis services –&nbsp;specialist mental health teams that help with crises that occur outside normal office hours and allow people to be treated at home for an acute episode of illness&nbsp;instead of in hospital\n- acute day hospitals –&nbsp;an alternative to inpatient care in a hospital, where you can visit every day or as often as necessary\n- assertive outreach teams – deliver intensive treatment and rehabilitation in the community for people with severe mental health problems and provide rapid help in a crisis situation; staff often visit people at home, act as advocates, liaise with other services (such as your GP or social services), and&nbsp;can also help with practical problems (such as helping to find housing and work), and daily tasks (such as shopping and cooking)\n- advocates – trained and experienced workers who help people communicate their needs or wishes, get impartial information, and represent their views to other people; they can be based in your hospital or mental health support groups, or you can find an independent advocate to act on your behalf\nWant to know more?\n- Mind: Mind in your area\nAvoid too much stress, including work-related stress. If you are employed, you may be able to work shorter hours or in a more flexible way.\nUnder the Equality Act 2010, all employers must make reasonable adjustments for people with disabilities, including people diagnosed with schizophrenia or other mental illnesses.\nSeveral&nbsp;organisations provide support, training and advice for people with schizophrenia who wish to continue working.\nYour community mental health team is a good first point of contact to find out what services and support are available for you.\nMental health charities such as Mind or Rethink Mental Illness are also an excellent source of information on training and employment.\nIf you are unable to work as a result of your mental illness, you are entitled to financial support, such as Incapacity Benefit.\nWant to know more?\n- GOV.UK: Disability and the Equality Act 2010\n- GOV.UK: Incapacity Benefit\n- Money Helper\nMany people find it helpful to meet other people with the same experiences for mutual support and to share ideas. It is also an important reminder that you are not alone.\nCharities and support groups allow individuals and families to share experiences and coping strategies, campaign for better services, and provide support. Useful charities, support groups and associations include:\n- Hearing Voices Network\n- Mind\n- Rethink Mental Illness\n- SANE\nThere are also other places that offer support to people with schizophrenia and other mental illnesses.\nEven if you do not have a job or are unable to work, it is still important to go out and do everyday things and&nbsp;give a structure to your week.\nMany people regularly go to a day hospital, day centre or community mental health centre. These offer a range of activities that&nbsp;allow you to get active again and spend some time in the company of other people.\nThese provide training to help you develop your work skills and support you back into work. They often have contacts with local employers.\nThis could be a bedsit or flat where there is someone around who is trained to support you and help you deal with day-to-day problems.\nYou may be offered&nbsp;the chance to&nbsp;meet regularly&nbsp;with a trained peer support worker who has recovered from psychosis or schizophrenia themselves.\nWant to know more?\n- Mind: Housing and mental health\nFriends, relatives and partners have a vital role in helping people with schizophrenia recover and make a relapse less likely.\nIt is very important not to blame the person with schizophrenia or tell them to &#8220;pull themselves together&#8221;, or to blame other people.&nbsp;It is important to stay positive and supportive when dealing with a friend or loved one&#8217;s mental illness.\nAs well as supporting the person with schizophrenia, you may want to get support to cope with your own feelings.&nbsp;Several voluntary organisations provide help and support for carers.\nFriends and family should try&nbsp;to understand what schizophrenia is, how it affects people, and how they can help.&nbsp;You can provide emotional and practical support, and encourage people to seek appropriate support and treatment.\nAs part of someone&#8217;s treatment, you may be offered family therapy. This can provide information and support for the person with schizophrenia and their family.\nFriends and family can play a major role by monitoring the person&#8217;s mental state, watching out for any signs of relapse, and encouraging them to take their medication and attend medical appointments.\nIf you are the nearest relative of a person who has schizophrenia, you have certain rights that can be used to protect the patient&#8217;s interests. These include requesting that the local social services authority ask an approved mental health professional to consider whether the person with schizophrenia should be detained in hospital.\nWant to know more?\n- Mind: How to cope as a carer\nMany people with schizophrenia experience periods of depression. Do not ignore these symptoms.&nbsp;If&nbsp;depression is not treated,&nbsp;it can worsen and lead to suicidal thoughts.\nStudies have shown that&nbsp;people with schizophrenia have a higher chance of committing suicide. If you have been feeling particularly down over the last month and no longer take pleasure in the things you used to enjoy, you may be depressed. See your GP for advice and treatment.\nImmediately report any suicidal thoughts to your GP or care co-ordinator.\nThe warning signs that people with depression and schizophrenia may be considering suicide include:\n- making final arrangements&nbsp;–&nbsp;such as giving away possessions, making a will or saying goodbye to friends\n- talking about death or suicide&nbsp;– this may be a direct statement such as, &#8220;I wish I was dead&#8221;, or indirect phrases such as, &#8220;I think that dead people must be happier than us&#8221;, or &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice to go to sleep and never wake up?&#8221;\n- self-harm&nbsp;–&nbsp;such as cutting their arms or legs, or burning themselves with cigarettes\n- a&nbsp;sudden lifting of mood&nbsp;– this&nbsp;could mean a person has decided to commit suicide and feels better because of their decision\nIf you see any of these warning signs:\n- get professional help for the person, such as from a crisis resolution team (CRT) or the duty psychiatrist at your local A&amp;E department\n- let them know they are not alone and you care about them\n- offer your support in finding other solutions to their problems\nIf you feel there is an immediate danger of the person committing suicide, stay with them or have someone else stay with them.

        "disease": "Sciatica",
        "description": "This information may be useful for those who have been diagnosed with sciatica. People who are experiencing new or ongoing symptoms should visit their healthcare professional for assessment, diagnosis or treatment.\nRead more about managing a back problem\nSciatica is a common condition and can also be known as nerve root or radicular pain.&nbsp;Sciatica is a term used to describe pain felt in the leg but which often comes from the lower back.\nThe sciatic nerve starts in the lower back and goes all the way down the back of the leg into the foot. Symptoms can be experienced along any part of the nerve. They can have a sudden or slow onset and can vary from mild to severe.\nSciatica can have a range of symptoms, these can include:\n- lower back pain\n- leg pain, often this feels worse than back pain\n- a change in sensation in the leg or foot\n- muscle spasms in the back\n- a weakness in the leg or foot\nA change in feeling in the leg or foot can include:\n- pins and needles\n- numbness\n- hot or cold\n- burning sensations\n- shooting sensations\n- sensations that can be hard to describe\nSciatica can be caused by irritation of the nerves which travel from the spine down the legs.  This can be from inflammation around the nerves and in some cases from pressure, usually from a disc related change.\nMost symptoms of sciatica will improve with time. Nerves are resilient and in most cases inflammation and any disc changes resolve allowing nerves to recover.\nIn order for sciatica to be diagnosed you&#8217;ll need an assessment from a healthcare professional.\nThey&#8217;ll ask you questions about your back and leg issue and then carry out a physical examination. This may include checking your range of movement and strength.\nYou may sometimes need to have a further examination to rule out other possible health conditions.\nA scan rarely changes how you manage the condition in the early stages. X-ray and MRI is generally not advised in people with sciatica. This is because structural changes of the spine are very common with age and often present in people who have no symptoms.\nA scan can be considered if your symptoms are unchanged for more than 12 weeks, continue to greatly impact your quality of life and you wish to consider surgery. Your healthcare professional can discuss this with you.\nSciatica usually improves within 12 weeks but this can vary significantly between individuals. For some people symptoms take up to a year to settle but can come and go within this time.\nIt&#8217;s important to remember, lots of things can influence symptoms such as&nbsp;poor sleep, stress and emotional wellbeing.\nRarely, sciatica can cause a condition called Cauda equina syndrome to develop.\nCauda equina syndrome is a rare but serious back condition which can lead to permanent damage or disability. If you develop this condition you&#8217;ll need to be seen by an emergency specialist spinal team.\nIf you have had a new significant trauma affecting your back in the last 7 days, for example a fall from height or a direct impact to the back area, you should also phone 111.\nMost people will recover from sciatica with a combination of time, modifying activity, and pacing themselves to allow the nerves to adapt. Pain medication, staying active, and gentle exercise will also help.\nThe nerve can still be sensitive so it is recommended to build up your tolerance to activities slowly.  The little and often approach to movement is recommended.\nThere are some things you can do to help manage this condition yourself.\nA&nbsp;back problem&nbsp;can sometimes mean you need to take some time off work to help recovery. How long you&#8217;re off will depend on the nature of your condition and your role at work.\nYou do not need to be symptom free before you consider returning to work. Continuing to go to work, or returning to work as soon as is possible for you, will help your recovery. Gradually getting back to your normal daily activities can help to build up your strength and stamina levels.\nFollowing this advice, you should see gradual improvements over time.\nYou should see the biggest change in your symptoms within the first couple of weeks. Most problems should have improved within 6 weeks.\nIf your sciatica hasn’t improved within 6 weeks of following this advice, or if your symptoms get worse at any time, talk to a healthcare professional about your symptoms.\nFind out about access to MSK services in your area\nWhen dealing with any health condition it&#8217;s important to also look after your mental wellbeing&nbsp;as this can impact your recovery."

        "disease": "About scoliosis",
        "description": "Scoliosis is the abnormal twisting and curvature of the spine. Scoliosis can develop at any age, but is most common in children aged 10 to 15.\nScoliosis is usually first noticed by a change in the appearance of the back.\nTypical signs include:\n- a visibly curved spine\n- one shoulder being higher than the other\n- one shoulder or hip being more prominent than the other\n- clothes not hanging properly\n- a prominent ribcage\n- a difference in leg lengths\nPeople with scoliosis may also have back pain. This is more common in adults.\nIf you or your child have signs of scoliosis, contact a healthcare professional. They can examine your back and decide the best next steps with you.\nOnce you or your child has been diagnosed with scoliosis, you should see a specialist to talk about treatment options.\nRarely scoliosis can cause a condition called cauda equina syndrome to develop. Cauda equina syndrome is serious back condition. It can lead to permanent damage or disability. If you develop this condition you’ll need to be seen by an emergency specialist spinal team.\nOr you have experienced a new onset of the following symptoms:\nIn most cases, the cause of scoliosis is unknown and it cannot usually be prevented. This is called idiopathic scoliosis. About 80% of cases of scoliosis are idiopathic.\nIt&#8217;s not thought to be linked with things like bad posture, exercise or diet.\nThere is a family history of the condition in some idiopathic cases. This suggests a possible genetic link.\nSome cases of scoliosis are caused by conditions that affect the nerves and muscles, like:\n- cerebral palsy – a condition that affects the brain and nerves and happens during or shortly after birth\n- muscular dystrophy – a genetic condition that causes muscle weakness\n- neurofibromatosis – a genetic condition that causes benign tumours to grow along your nerves\nIn rare cases, babies can be born with scoliosis. This is known as congenital scoliosis. It&#8217;s caused by the bones in the spine not developing properly in the womb.\nIn adults, scoliosis can sometimes be caused by age related changes to parts of the spine. This is known as degenerative scoliosis.\nRead more information on types of scoliosis from Scoliosis Support and Research\nScoliosis is first assessed by a healthcare professional with a physical examination of the spine, ribs, hips and shoulders.\nYou may be asked to bend forward to see if any areas are particularly prominent. For example, one of your shoulders may be higher than the other or there may be a bulge in your back or ribs.\nAfter your assessment you may be referred to an spinal specialist. They will discuss further tests and treatments with you.\nThe specialist will usually take an X-ray to confirm the diagnosis of scoliosis.\nThis will help determine the size and shape of the curve.\nIn some cases, scans like a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan or a computerised tomography (CT) scan can be recommended.\nRead about scoliosis treatment for children and young people\nRead about scoliosis treatment for adults\nScoliosis can sometimes lead to further emotional and physical problems.\nHaving a visibly curved spine or wearing a back brace can cause problems related to body image, self-esteem and overall quality of life. This is particularly the case for children and teenagers with scoliosis.\nIf this is a problem for you or your child, you may find it useful to contact a scoliosis support group, like the Scoliosis Association UK. These groups are a good source of information and support for people with scoliosis.\nIn young children with severe scoliosis, the rib cage can be pushed against the heart and lungs. This can cause breathing problems and make it difficult for the heart to pump blood around the body.\nThis can also increase the chances of developing lung infections, like pneumonia, and can lead to problems like heart failure.\nIn some cases of scoliosis, particularly those affecting adults, the bones in the spine compress nearby nerves. In severe cases, this can cause problems like:\n- back and leg pain\n- numbness or weakness in the legs"

        "disease": "Seasonal affective disorder (SAD)",
        "description": "Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that has a seasonal pattern. The symptoms often begin in the autumn as the days start getting shorter. They are most severe during December, January and February. It&#8217;s sometimes known as &#8216;winter depression&#8217;.\nIn most cases, the symptoms of SAD begin to improve in the spring before disappearing.\nThe symptoms of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) differ throughout the year and from person to person.\nThe symptoms of SAD are usually fairly mild at the start of the autumn. They might get worse as the winter progresses and the amount of sunlight decreases. However, the nature and severity of the symptoms of SAD will vary from person to person.\nIf you have SAD, you may experience depressive symptoms like:\n- low mood\n- a loss of pleasure or interest in normal, everyday activities\n- irritability\n- feelings of despair\n- feelings of guilt and worthlessness\n- low self-esteem\n- indecisiveness\n- tearfulness\n- stress or anxiety\n- a reduced sex drive\nYou may also:\n- be less active than normal\n- feel tired and sleep more than normal (hypersomnia)\n- feel lethargic (lack energy)\n- find it difficult to concentrate\n- have an increased appetite and eat more than usual (hyperphagia)\nFor many people, SAD can be a difficult condition to live with because it can have a significant effect on your day-to-day life.\nSome people with SAD experience recurring episodes of unipolar depression. This is where you only experience depressive symptoms. Others find they experience mild episodes of bipolar depression. This is when depressed periods are followed by manic periods where you feel happy, energetic and much more sociable.\nThe exact cause of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is unknown. The symptoms of depression are thought to be linked to less exposure to sunlight.\nOne theory is that light stimulates a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. This part controls your mood, sleep and appetite, affecting how you feel.\nIn people with SAD, lack of sunlight and a problem with certain chemicals in the brain prevents the hypothalamus from working properly. The lack of light is thought to affect:\n- the production of melatonin &#8211; melatonin is a hormone that makes you sleepy; in people with SAD, the body may produce it in higher than normal levels\n- the production of serotonin – serotonin is a hormone that affects your mood, appetite and sleep; a lack of sunlight may lead to lower serotonin levels, which is linked to feelings of depression\nyour internal body clock (circadian rhythm) &#8211; your body uses sunlight to time important biological functions, like when you wake up, so lower light levels during winter may disrupt your body clock causing SAD\nThere are many different causes and contributing factors associated with depression. Some of these may also contribute to SAD. Possibilities include:\n- genetic and family factors, like a family history of depression, could mean that you inherit particular genes (units of genetic material) that make depression more likely\n- childhood experiences, like neglect or sexual abuse\n- personality, for example if you&#8217;re someone who is naturally quite anxious\n- psychological factors, relating to how your brain interprets emotions and how you think about things\nsocial factors, like your relationships with other people and whether you have close friends\nSAD is often difficult to diagnose because the there are many other types of depression that have similar symptoms. It may take several years before you and your GP realise that your symptoms are forming a regular pattern.\nYour GP might carry out a psychological assessment to check your mental health. During the assessment, you may be asked questions about:\n- your mood\n- your lifestyle\n- your eating patterns\n- your sleeping patterns\n- any seasonal changes in your thoughts and behaviour\n- whether there is anything in your personal history that may contribute to a depressive disorder, like abuse\n- whether there is anything in your family history that may contribute to a depressive disorder, like a family history of depression\nYour GP may also carry out a brief physical examination to check for any other possible causes of your symptoms.\nA diagnosis of SAD will depend on whether:\n- you&#8217;ve had symptoms during the same seasons for 2 or more years in a row\n- your periods of depression are followed by periods without depression\n- there are any other obvious explanations or causes for your seasonal mood changes\nYour GP will recommend the most suitable treatment option for you. This may involve using a combination of treatments to get the best results.\nTreatment options may include:\n- cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) – a talking therapy. It helps you change how you think and react to situations that are making you unhappy\n- counselling – another type of talking therapy where you talk to a trained counsellor about your worries and problems\n- psychodynamic psychotherapy – where you can discuss how you feel about yourself, how you feel about others and experiences in your past\nIf other treatments like CBT, counselling and psychotherapy aren&#8217;t helping, there are some other options that might be offered to you.\nAntidepressants are often only prescribed for SAD when the symptoms are severe. This is because there&#8217;s limited evidence that they&#8217;re effective.\nIt&#8217;s thought that they are most effective if they&#8217;re taken at the start of winter (before the symptoms appear) and continued until spring.\nIt can take between four and six weeks for antidepressants to take full effect. It&#8217;s also important to continue to take the medication as prescribed, even if you start to feel better.\nRead more about antidepressants\nResearchers think that light therapy works by simulating the sunlight that&#8217;s missing during the darker winter months.\nThis additional light encourages your brain to\n- reduce the production of melatonin (the hormone that makes you sleepy)\n- increase the production of serotonin (the hormone that affects your mood)\nIt&#8217;s thought that altering the levels of both hormones can help to ease your symptoms of SAD.\nHowever, there&#8217;s mixed evidence about the effectiveness of light therapy. It&#8217;s difficult to compare the research because they use a variety of light sources. Also, many of the clinical trials (medical tests) were conducted over short periods of time.\nThe studies which showed that light therapy is effective discovered that it&#8217;s best if used first thing in the morning.\nLight therapy produces short-term results. It may help to relieve your current symptoms, but you&#8217;ll still be affected by SAD next winter.\nWhen buying a light box, make sure that you choose one that is:\n- made by a fully certified manufacturer\n- medically proven to treat SAD\nCheck the manufacturer’s information and instructions to see:\n- whether the product is suitable for treating SAD\n- the light intensity you should be using\n- how long you need to sit in front of the light\nThe SAD Association can provide a list of recommended manufacturers.\nVery bright light may not be suitable if you:\n- have an eye problem or your eyes are particularly sensitive to light\n- are taking certain types of medication, such as antidepressants\n- have epilepsy, a condition that causes seizures (fits)\nSpeak to your GP if you&#8217;re unsure about a particular product or if you experience any side effects while using light therapy."

        "disease": "Sepsis",
        "description": "Always trust your instincts and phone 999 if you think there&#8217;s an emergency.\nIf your GP practice is closed, phone 111.\nTrust your instincts and phone 111 if your child&rsquo;s symptoms are getting worse or they are sicker than you&rsquo;d expect (even if their temperature falls).\nSepsis is a serious complication of an infection.\nWithout quick treatment, sepsis can lead to multiple organ failure and death.\nThe immune system usually keeps an infection limited to one place. This is called a localised infection. To do this, the body produces white blood cells.\nWhite blood cells travel to an infection site to destroy the germs causing the infection. This triggers tissue swelling, known as inflammation. This helps to fight the infection and prevent it from spreading.\nHowever, an infection can spread to other parts of the body if the immune system is weak or an infection is severe.\nWidespread inflammation can damage tissue and interfere with blood flow. When blood flow is interrupted, blood pressure can drop dangerously low. This stops oxygen from reaching the organs and tissues.\nSepsis can be triggered by an infection in any part of the body. The most common sites of infection that lead to sepsis are the:\n- lungs\n- urinary tract\n- tummy (abdomen)\n- pelvis\nHowever, sometimes the specific infection and source of sepsis can&#8217;t be identified.\n- appendicitis – infection in the appendix\n- cellulitis – a skin infection that can be caused by an intravenous catheter that&#8217;s been inserted through the skin to give fluids or medication\n- cholangitis – an infection of the bile duct\n- cholecystitis – an infection of the gallbladder\n- encephalitis &#8211; an infection of the brain and nervous system\n- endocarditis – a heart infection\n- flu – only in some cases\n- meningitis – an infection of the brain and nervous system\n- peritonitis – an infection of the thin layer of tissue that lines the abdomen\n- pneumonia &#8211; a lung infection\n- post-surgery infections\n- osteomyelitis – a bone infection\n- urinary tract infection – an infection of the bladder, urethra or kidneys\nSepsis is often diagnosed by testing your:\n- temperature\n- heart rate\n- breathing rate\n- blood\nOther tests can help determine the type of infection, where it&#8217;s located and which parts of the body have been affected. These include:\n- urine or stool samples\n- a wound culture – where a small sample of tissue, skin or fluid is taken from the affected area for testing\n- respiratory secretion testing – taking a sample of saliva, phlegm or mucus\n- blood pressure tests\n- imaging studies – like an X-ray, ultrasound scan or computerised tomography (CT) scan\nAnyone can develop sepsis after an injury or minor infection. However, some people are more vulnerable, including people who:\n- are very young\n- are very old\n- are pregnant\n- have had a urinary catheter fitted\n- have a long term health condition like diabetes\n- have recently had surgery\n- are genetically prone to infections\n- are already in hospital with a serious illness\n- have to stay in hospital for a long time\n- have wounds or injuries as a result of an accident\n- have a medical condition that weakens the immune system – like HIV or leukaemia\n- are receiving medical treatment that weakens the immune system – like chemotherapy or long-term steroids\n- are on mechanical ventilation – where a machine is used to help you breathe\nSome people make a full recovery from sepsis fairly quickly. The amount of time it takes to fully recover from sepsis varies depending on:\n- the severity of the sepsis\n- the person&#8217;s overall health\n- how much time was spent in hospital\n- whether treatment was needed in an intensive care unit (ICU)\nSome people with sepsis will experience long-term physical and psychological problems. This is known as post-sepsis syndrome.\nSymptoms of post-sepsis syndrome include:\n- feeling lethargic or excessively tired\n- muscle weakness\n- swollen limbs\n- joint pain\n- chest pain\n- breathlessness\nSepsis can cause a variety of symptoms.\n- over 38C (babies under 3 months)\n- over 39C (babies aged 3 to 6 months)\n- below 36C – check 3 times in a 10-minute period\n- a high temperature in a child who can’t be encouraged to show interest in anything\n- difficulty breathing – this looks like hard work\n- grunting with every breath\n- struggling to speak more than a few words at once (for older children who normally talk)\n- breathing that obviously &#8220;pauses&#8221;\n- no interest in feeding (child under 1 month)\n- not drinking for more than 8 hours (when awake)\n- black, green or bloody vomit\n- a soft spot on a baby&#8217;s head that bulges\n- “sunken” eyes\n- a baby that’s floppy\n- a child that can’t be encouraged to show interest in anything\n- weak, whining or continuous crying in a younger child\n- confusion in an older child\n- irritableness\n- unresponsive\n- stiffness in the neck, especially when trying to look up or down\n- not had a wee or wet nappy for 12 hours\nEarly symptoms of sepsis may include:\n- a high temperature (fever) or low body temperature\n- chills and shivering\n- a fast heartbeat\n- fast breathing\nIn some cases, symptoms of more severe sepsis or septic shock&nbsp;(when your blood pressure drops to a dangerously low level) develop.\nThese can include:\n- feeling dizzy or faint\n- a change in mental state – like confusion or disorientation\n- diarrhoea\n- nausea and vomiting\n- slurred speech\n- severe muscle pain\n- severe breathlessness\n- less urine production than normal – for example, not urinating for a day\n- cold, clammy and pale or mottled skin\n- loss of consciousness\nTreatment for sepsis varies, depending on the:\n- area affected\n- cause of the infection\n- organs affected\n- extent of any damage\nIf you have the early signs of sepsis, you&#8217;ll usually be referred to hospital. You&#8217;ll then be given a diagnosis and treatment.\nYou&#8217;ll need emergency treatment, or treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU), if:\n- the sepsis is severe\n- you develop septic shock&nbsp;– when your blood pressure drops to a dangerously low level\nICUs can support body functions like breathing that are affected by sepsis. This allows the medical staff to focus on treating the infection.\nSepsis is treatable if it&#8217;s identified and treated quickly. In most cases it leads to full recovery with no lasting problems.\nThe main treatment for sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock is antibiotics. These will be given directly into a vein (intravenously).\nIdeally, antibiotic treatment should start within an hour of diagnosis.\nIntravenous antibiotics are usually replaced by tablets after 2 to 4 days. You may have to take them for 7 to 10 days or longer, depending on the severity of your condition.\nIf sepsis is suspected, broad-spectrum antibiotics are given first. This is because there won&#8217;t be time to wait until a specific type of infection has been identified.\nBroad-spectrum antibiotics work against a wide range of known infectious bacteria. They usually cure most common infections.\nOnce a specific bacterium has been identified, a more focused antibiotic can be used.\nIf the sepsis is caused by a virus, antibiotics won&#8217;t work. However, it would be too dangerous to delay treatment to find out the specific cause. This means antibiotics are usually given anyway.\nWith a viral infection, you&#8217;ll need to wait until your immune system starts to tackle it. However, antiviral medication may be given in some cases.\nIf you have sepsis, your body needs more fluid to prevent dehydration and kidney failure.\nIf you have severe sepsis or septic shock, you&#8217;ll usually be given fluids intravenously for the first 24 to 48 hours.\nIt&#8217;s important that the doctors know how much urine your kidneys are making when you have sepsis. This helps them spot signs of kidney failure.\nIf you&#8217;re admitted with severe sepsis or septic shock, you&#8217;ll usually be given a catheter. This is inserted into your bladder to monitor your urine output.\nYour body&#8217;s oxygen demand goes up if you have sepsis.\nIf you&#8217;re admitted to hospital with sepsis and the level of oxygen in your blood is low, you&#8217;ll usually be given oxygen. This is given through a mask or tubes in your nostrils.\nIf a source of the infection can be identified, like an abscess or infected wound, this will also need to be treated.\nFor example, any pus may need to be drained away. In more serious cases, surgery may be needed to remove the infected tissue and repair any damage.\nMedications called vasopressors are used if you have low blood pressure caused by sepsis.\nVasopressors are normally given intravenously while you&#8217;re in an ICU. Extra fluids may also be given intravenously to help increase blood pressure.\nYou may require additional treatments like:\n- corticosteroids\n- insulin medication\n- a blood transfusion\n- mechanical ventilation – where a machine is used to help you breathe\n- dialysis – where a machine filters your blood to copy the function of your kidneys\nThese treatments are mostly used in ICUs."

        "disease": "Septic shock",
        "description": "Septic shock is a life-threatening condition that happens when your blood pressure drops to a dangerously low level after an infection.\nAny type of bacteria can cause the infection. Fungi such as candida and viruses can also be a cause, although this is rare.\nAt first the infection can lead to a reaction called sepsis. This begins with:\n- weakness\n- chills\n- a rapid heart and breathing rate\nLeft untreated, toxins produced by bacteria can damage the small blood vessels, causing them to leak fluid into the surrounding tissues.\nThis can affect your heart&#8217;s ability to pump blood to your organs, which lowers your blood pressure and means blood doesn&#8217;t reach vital organs, such as the brain and liver.\nYou think that you or someone in your care has symptoms of septic shock like:\nPeople with a weakened immune system have an increased risk of developing septic shock.\nThis includes:\n- newborn babies\n- elderly people\n- pregnant women\n- people with long-term health conditions, such as diabetes, cirrhosis or kidney failure\n- people with lowered immune systems, such as those with HIV or AIDS or those receiving chemotherapy\nYou&#8217;ll usually be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) so your body&#8217;s functions and organs can be supported while the infection is treated. In some cases treatment may start in the emergency department.\nTreatment may include:\n- oxygen therapy\n- fluids given directly through a vein (intravenously)\n- medication to increase your blood flow\n- antibiotics\n- surgery (in some cases)\nTo help you breathe more easily, you&#8217;ll be given oxygen through a face mask, a tube inserted into your nose, or an endotracheal tube inserted into your mouth. If you have severe shortness of breath, a mechanical ventilator may be used.\nYou&#8217;ll probably be given fluids directly into a vein. This will help raise your blood pressure by increasing the amount of fluid in your blood.\nTo increase the blood flow to your vital organs, such as your brain, liver, kidneys and heart, you may be prescribed inotropic medicines or vasopressors.\nInotropic medicines (inotropes), such as dobutamine, stimulate your heart. They increase the strength of your heartbeat, which helps get oxygen-rich blood to your tissues and organs, where it&#8217;s needed.\nVasopressors include:\n- dopamine\n- adrenaline\n- noradrenaline\nThese medicines will cause your blood vessels to narrow, increasing your blood pressure and the flow of blood around your body. This will allow your vital organs to start functioning properly.\nAntibiotics are often used to treat the associated bacterial infection. The type of antibiotic used depends on the type of bacterial infection and where in the body the infection started.\nYou may be started on antibiotics immediately to increase your chances of survival. Initially, two or three types of antibiotics may be used. The most effective type of antibiotic can be used once the bacterium responsible for the infection is identified.\nIn severe cases of sepsis or septic shock, the large decrease in blood pressure and blood flow can kill organ tissue. If this happens, surgery may be required to remove the dead tissue.\nThe chances of surviving septic shock will depend on:\n- the cause of infection\n- the number of organs that have failed\n- how soon treatment is started\nComplications of septic shock can include:\n- inability of the lungs to take in enough oxygen (respiratory failure)\n- the heart not being able to pump enough blood around the body (heart failure)\n- kidney failure or injury\n- abnormal blood clotting\nThese are serious health conditions that will need to be treated urgently. Septic shock can be fatal because of complications like these."

        "disease": "Severe head injury",
        "description": "Severe head injuries need urgent medical assessment as there&#8217;s a risk of serious permanent brain damage.\nIt can be hard to tell the difference between a minor and a severe head injury.\nRead about minor head injuries\nThe symptoms of a severe head injury can vary from person to person.\nA person with a severe head injury should be seen in an A&amp;E (accident and emergency) department.\nThe healthcare professionals treating you will prioritise any life-threatening injuries. Once you&#8217;re in a stable condition, they&#8217;ll ask some questions. This can help with the diagnosis and treatment of your injury.\nIf someone witnessed your accident, it&#8217;s helpful for them to come to hospital with you to describe what happened.\nA healthcare professional will assess your brain function using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). This is an assessment of how serious your brain injury is. It&#8217;s based on your ability to open your eyes, to speak, and to move your body.\nYou may have a computerised tomography (CT) scan. This produces a detailed image of the inside of your head. This image shows whether there&#8217;s any bleeding, bruising or swelling in your brain.\nSkull x-rays are not carried out anymore as they do not provide information on brain damage.\nIf someone is confused, they may struggle to cooperate with a CT scan. In these cases, they may require anaesthesia to allow the scan to happen and to prevent their brain injury from getting worse.\nSome people who sustain a severe head injury enter a state of impaired consciousness. Examples of impaired consciousness are confusion, drowsiness and coma.\nThis can last for a few days, weeks, or years, and can be caused by other things like alcohol or drugs.\nIt&#8217;s possible for someone to partially or fully recover from impaired consciousness, depending on the cause.\nIf someone is in a state of impaired consciousness, the medical professionals treating them can sometimes give further information on:\n- their current state\n- how likely they are to recover\nDepending on your specific injury and examination results, you may be:\n- admitted to hospital for further testing and treatment\n- allowed to go home after examination\n- sent home with advice to attend follow-up appointments at your local neurological centre or head injury clinic\nIf you&#8217;re admitted to hospital, the treatment you receive will depend on your injuries.\nWounds to the head often bleed a lot, especially if you&#8217;re taking anti-coagulant medications (like warfarin or apixaban).\nAny cuts or grazes to your head will be treated to prevent further bleeding or infection. If there are foreign bodies in the wound, like broken glass, they&#8217;ll need to be removed.\nDeep or large cuts may need to be closed with glue, stitches or staples until they heal. Local anaesthetic may be used to numb the area around the cut so you don&#8217;t feel any pain.\nIf you need to be observed, the healthcare professionals treating you will regularly check:\n- your level of consciousness and how alert you are (using GCS)\n- the size of your pupils and how well they react to light\n- how well you can move your arms and legs\n- your breathing, heart rate, blood pressure, temperature and the level of oxygen in your blood\nThis gives medical professionals a bedside assessment of how your brain injury is progressing.\nNeurosurgery is any type of surgery used to treat nervous system problems (problems with the brain, spinal cord and nerves). The majority of head injuries will heal by themselves and do not benefit from neurosurgery.\nIf surgery is needed, a neurosurgeon (a specialist in brain surgery) may speak to you or your family first.\nHowever, some problems may require urgent treatment. This means there may not be time to discuss surgery before it&#8217;s carried out. In such cases, your surgeon will discuss the surgery with you or your family after the operation.\nSomeone who has neurosurgery is likely to need close monitoring after their operation, and have a long rehabilitation period.\nYour skull may be fractured during a head injury. Skull x-rays are of very limited value because it gives little information about brain injury. Instead, a CT scan will help determine the extent of the injury.\nMost skull fractures will heal by themselves, particularly if they&#8217;re simple, linear fractures. The healing process can take many months. You may have a headache for a few weeks. This should be eased with over-the-counter painkillers.\nBecause severe head injuries can cause such damage, serious complications can happen. These can sometimes be permanent.\nComplications can include:\nThe brain and its lining can become infected (meningitis). You may be offered a vaccination to prevent this happening.\nThere are many reasons brain injury can happen. It can be temporary or permanent. The effects of brain injury are difficult to predict, but could include:\n- headaches and tiredness\n- problems with your memory\n- difficulty moving, keeping your balance, or with co-ordination\n- loss of your sense of taste smell\n- changes in your vision, including blind spots\n- difficulty thinking, processing information and solving problems\n- difficulty with speech and communication\n- changes to your normal feelings and behaviour\n- aggression or loss of inhibitions\n- epilepsy\nSome people experience the symptoms of concussion for a long time after the initial injury. This is called post-concussion syndrome.\nRead more about post-concussion syndrome\nWhen you&#8217;ve recovered enough to go home, you&#8217;ll need someone to take you. You should not drive until you&#8217;ve completely recovered.\nIf you&#8217;ve been sent home less than 24 hours after your injury happened, you&#8217;ll need someone to stay with you until this time has passed. This is to keep an eye out for problems appearing.\nYou may be advised not to take your blood thinning medication for a short period.\nDo not stop taking any medicine that&rsquo;s been prescribed without checking with your GP or healthcare professional first. You could make yourself very ill.\nYou may be advised to see your GP the week after you&#8217;re discharged from hospital, so they can check how you&#8217;re coping.\nYou may also have a follow-up appointment at a head injury clinic. This will usually be with a specialist in head injury.\nDepending on your injury, you may be offered different treatment to help you recover. This could include:\n- physiotherapy, to help with physical problems like weakness, stiffness or poor co-ordination\n- occupational therapy, to help you if you’re struggling with everyday tasks\n- speech therapy\n- psychological therapy, to help you cope if your injury has affected your mental wellbeing\nEvery brain injury is different. It&#8217;s a good idea to seek further information about possible effects and rehabilitation techniques. A number of charities and organisations may be able to help, including:\n- Brain and Spinal Injury Centre (BASIC)\n- Brain and Spine Foundation\n- Child Brain Injury Trust\n- Headway"

        "disease": "Shingles",
        "description": "Shingles, also known as herpes zoster, is an infection of a nerve and the skin around it. It&#8217;s caused by the varicella-zoster virus, which also causes chickenpox.\nThe main symptom of shingles is pain, followed by a rash that develops into itchy&nbsp;blisters. These look like&nbsp;chickenpox.\nSometimes shingles causes symptoms that develop a few days before the painful rash. This includes symptoms like:\n- a&nbsp;headache\n- burning, tingling, numbness or itchiness of the skin in the affected area\n- a feeling of being generally unwell\n- a high temperature (fever)\nThe shingles rash usually appears on one side of your body. It develops on the area of skin related to the affected nerve.\nNew blisters can appear for up to a week. A few days after appearing they become yellowish in colour, flatten and dry out.\nScabs then form where the blisters were, which may leave some slight scarring.\nShingles on the back\nShingles on the chest\nShingles on the face\nShingles on back of neck\nMost people with shingles experience a localised band of pain in the affected area.\nThe pain may be a constant, dull or burning sensation and its intensity can vary from mild to severe. You may have sharp stabbing pains from time to time, and the affected area of skin will usually be tender.\nYou haven&#8217;t had chickenpox before, you&#8217;ve been exposed to someone who has chickenpox or shingles and you:\nIf your GP is closed, phone 111.\nIf the pharmacist cannot treat you they may recommend you see your GP.\nFind your nearest pharmacy\nWhen you catch chickenpox the virus stays in your body. It can become active again later on if your immune system is lowered and cause shingles.\nYour immune system can be lowered by things like:\n- stress\n- other illnesses or conditions\n- treatments like chemotherapy\nIt&#8217;s possible to have shingles more than once, but it&#8217;s very rare to get it more than twice.\nThere&#8217;s no cure for shingles. But, there are ways to ease your symptoms until the condition improves.\nShingles symptoms usually get better in 2 to 4 weeks.\nSpeak to your GP or pharmacist as soon as you get symptoms of shingles. Early treatment may help to reduce the severity of the condition and complications.\nYour GP or pharmacist may recommend painkillers to ease discomfort caused by shingles. This includes:\n- paracetamol\n- non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)&nbsp;like&nbsp;ibuprofen\n- opioids &#8211; used for more severe pain\n- antidepressants&nbsp;&#8211; used for severe pain\n- anticonvulsants &#8211; used for severe pain\nSome people with shingles may also be prescribed antiviral tablets.\nYou can&#8217;t give shingles to other people. But, other people can catch chickenpox from you if they haven&#8217;t had it before.\nIf you have shingles, you&#8217;re contagious until the last blister has dried and scabbed over.\nTo help prevent the virus being passed on:\nChickenpox&nbsp;can be particularly dangerous for certain groups of people. If you have shingles, avoid:\n- pregnant women who haven&#8217;t had chickenpox before\n- people with a weak immune system, for example someone with HIV or AIDS\n- babies less than 1 month old (unless it&#8217;s your own baby)\nComplications can sometimes occur as a result of shingles. They are more likely if your immune system is low, (the body&#8217;s natural defence system), or are elderly.\nShingles is rarely life threatening. Complications, though, can mean that around 1 in every 1,000 cases in adults over the age of 70 is fatal.\nComplications can include:\n- postherpetic neuralgia\n- eye problems\n- Ramsay Hunt syndrome\n- the rash becoming infected with bacteria\n- white patches (a loss of pigment) or scarring in the area of the rash\n- inflammation of the lungs&nbsp;(pneumonia), liver (hepatitis), brain (encephalitis), spinal cord (transverse myelitis), or protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord&nbsp;(meningitis)&nbsp;– these complications are rare.\nRead about the shingles vaccine and find out if you&#8217;re eligible"

        "disease": "Shortness of breath",
        "description": "It&#8217;s normal to get out of breath when you&#8217;ve overexerted yourself. But when breathlessness comes on suddenly and unexpectedly, it&#8217;s usually a sign of a medical condition.\nYour child is short of breath and:\nIf your GP practice is closed, phone 111.\nYour doctor may ask you some questions, such as:\n- did the breathlessness come on suddenly or slowly?\n- did anything trigger it, such as exercise?\n- how bad is it?\n- does it only happen when you&#8217;ve been active, or when you&#8217;re not doing anything?\n- is there any pain when you breathe?\n- do you have a cough?\n- do certain positions make it worse – for example, can you lie down?\nFeeling like you can&#8217;t get enough air can be scary. Make sure you get help from a healthcare professional. They may give you extra oxygen to breathe if you need it.\nThere are different health conditions that can cause sudden and unexpected breathlessness.\nSudden breathlessness could be an asthma attack. You&#8217;ll feel breathless because it&#8217;s difficult to move air in and out of your airways. Your GP may advise you to use a spacer device with your inhaler to help your breathlessness.\nPneumonia (lung inflammation) may also cause shortness of breath and a cough. It&#8217;s usually caused by an infection, so you&#8217;ll need to take antibiotics.\nIf you have COPD, it&#8217;s likely your breathlessness is a sign this condition has suddenly got worse.\nIt&#8217;s possible to have a heart attack without having all the obvious symptoms, such as chest pain and anxiety.\nIn this case, shortness of breath may be the only warning sign you&#8217;re having a heart attack. If you or your GP think this is the case, they&#8217;ll give you aspirin and admit you to hospital straight away.\nHeart failure can also cause breathing difficulties. Heart failure means your heart cannot pump enough blood around your body. It&#8217;s usually because the heart muscle has become too weak or stiff to work properly. It leads to a build-up of fluid inside the lungs, which makes breathing more difficult. Lifestyle changes and medicines or surgery will help the heart pump better and relieve your breathlessness.\nBreathlessness could also be linked to a problem with your heart rate or rhythm. For example, atrial fibrillation (an irregular and fast heart rate) or supraventricular tachycardia (regular and fast heart rate).\nA panic attack or anxiety can cause you to take rapid or deep breaths, known as hyperventilating. Concentrating on slow breathing or breathing through a paper bag can bring your breathing back to normal. This should only be done when you are sure that anxiety is the cause of your breathlessness.\nMore unusual causes include:\n- a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis)\n- pneumothorax – partial collapse of your lung caused by a small tear in the lung surface, which allows air to become trapped in the space around your lungs\n- pulmonary embolism – a blockage in one of the blood vessels in the lung\n- idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis – a condition that causes scarring of the lungs\n- pleural effusion – excess fluid next to the lung\n- diabetic ketoacidosis – a complication of diabetes where acids build up in your blood and urine\nLong-term breathlessness is usually caused by:\n- obesity\n- being unfit\n- poorly controlled asthma\n- chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\n- anaemia\n- heart failure\n- a problem with your heart rate or rhythm\nMore unusual causes of long-term breathlessness are:\n- bronchiectasis\n- a blockage in a blood vessel in the lung (pulmonary embolism)\n- partial collapse of your lung caused by lung cancer\n- excess fluid next to the lung (pleural effusion)\n- narrowing of the main heart valve, restricting blood flow to the rest of the body\n- having panic attacks often"

        "disease": "Sickle cell disease",
        "description": "Sickle cell disease is the name for a group of blood disorders. The most severe is sickle cell anaemia. These disorders are inherited, meaning they are passed on through your genes.\nYou can have a blood test at any time to find out if you carry the gene for sickle cell disease, or if you have sickle cell disease.\nSickle cell disease affects how your body produces red blood cells. Normal red blood cells are round – red blood cells affected by sickle cell disease harden and become sickle-shaped, like a crescent moon. This causes them to die too quickly and block blood vessels, leading to symptoms that are often painful.\nPeople from particular ethnic backgrounds are more likely to have sickle cell disease or carry the gene. You are more likely to have sickle cell disease if you are from one of these ethnic backgrounds:\n- African\n- Asian\n- Caribbean\n- Eastern Mediterranean\n- Middle Eastern\nThere are treatments to manage sickle cell disease, but no cure yet – it&#8217;s a lifelong condition.\nFind out about symptoms and diagnosis\nFind out about treating sickle cell disease\nFind out about living with sickle cell disease\nFind out about screening to see if you&#8217;re a sickle cell carrier\nThe main symptoms of sickle cell disease are sickle cell crises (very painful episodes affecting different parts of the body), infections, and anaemia.\nThere are a number of serious problems that can appear suddenly as a result of sickle cell disease. If you experience any of the following symptoms, you should get medical advice immediately:\n- high temperature (a fever) going to 38C (100.4F) or higher\n- difficulty breathing\n- drowsiness, confusion, or slurred speech\n- a severe headache, stiff neck, or dizziness\n- skin or lips that are very pale\n- fits (seizures)\n- serious pain that isn&#8217;t responding to treatments at home\n- sudden swelling in the tummy\n- priapism – a painful erection lasting two hours or more\n- weakness on one or both sides of your body\n- sudden vision loss, or changes in your vision\nIf you develop any of the symptoms listed above, phone your GP or care team immediately. If you can&#8217;t contact your GP or care team, go to your closest Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E) department. Dial 999 for an ambulance if you aren&#8217;t able to travel yourself.\nIt&#8217;s important to make sure that the medical team looking after you know that you have sickle cell disease.\nEpisodes of pain known as sickle cell crises happen when the blood vessels that go to one part of your body become blocked. The pain can be severe.\nSickle cell crises are one of the most common symptoms of sickle cell disease and, on average, occur once a year and last up to seven days. Some people have sickle cell crises every few weeks – others experience them less than once a year.\nA sickle cell crisis typically affects one part of the body at a time. The most common parts affected are:\n- hands or feet (this is especially common in young children)\n- ribs and breastbone\n- spine\n- pelvis\n- tummy\n- legs and arms\nSickle cell crises have different causes. They can be triggered by cold, rainy or windy weather, stress, dehydration, or exercise that leaves you severely out of breath.\nSickle cell disease leaves people – especially children – extra vulnerable to infection because their bodies aren&#8217;t as effective at dealing with bacteria and viruses. This leaves them more vulnerable to viruses like the common cold, as well as severe and potentially life-threatening conditions like meningitis.\nAs well as keeping up to date with their vaccinations, many people with sickle cell disease take daily doses of antibiotics in order to prevent infections.\nAlmost everyone with sickle cell disease has anaemia. Haemoglobin is found in red blood cells – it&#8217;s the substance that transports oxygen around the body. People with anaemia have low levels of haemoglobin in their blood.\nMost of the time anaemia doesn&#8217;t cause symptoms, but if you&#8217;re infected with parvovirus, the virus that causes slapped cheek syndrome, the anaemia can get worse. When that happens, it causes:\n- headaches\n- a fast heartbeat\n- fainting\n- dizziness\nIf these symptoms occur, the anaemia is usually treated with a blood transfusion.\nSudden anaemia can happen in young children if they experience swelling of the spleen. This is also treated with a blood transfusion.\nThere&#8217;s a wide range of other issues that can be caused by sickle cell disease. These include:\n- a serious lung condition called acute chest syndrome that can cause chest pain, a cough, breathing difficulties and fever\n- pain in bones and joints\n- delayed puberty\n- delayed growth in childhood\n- kidney or urinary problems, including bedwetting and blood in the urine\n- gallstones – these are stones in the gallbladder that can cause jaundice (yellow eyes and skin) and abdominal (tummy) pain\n- ulcers on the lower legs (open sores that can be very painful)\n- priapism – a painful, persistent erection that can last for several hours\n- high blood pressure (pulmonary hypertension)\n- transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) or strokes – these happen when blood flow to the brain is interrupted or blocked\n- enlarged spleen – this can cause a fast heartbeat, worsening of anaemia, a swollen tummy, shortness of breath and abdominal pain\n- vision problems like floaters, worsened night vision, blurred vision, patchy vision and, occasionally, sudden vision loss\nThese symptoms can be treated – see Treating sickle cell disease for more information.\nYou can have a blood test any time to find out if you have sickle cell disease, or find out if you&#8217;re a carrier who could have a child with the condition.\nSickle cell disease is usually diagnosed during pregnancy – free screening to find out if a baby is at risk of having the condition is offered to every pregnant woman in Scotland.\nEven if your family background doesn&#8217;t make it likely your child will have sickle cell disease, you can still request a test.\nIf possible, screening should be done before the tenth week of pregnancy, so that there&#8217;s time to think about further tests that can find out if your baby will be born with sickle cell disease.\nNewborn babies are screened for sickle cell disease as part of the newborn blood spot test – the heel prick test. There are a few reasons for this:\n- if a baby&#8217;s parents weren&#8217;t screened during pregnancy, this test identifies if the child has sickle cell disease\n- if screening during pregnancy showed that the baby had a high risk of having sickle cell disease, but no more testing was done, the heel prick test will determine if the child has the condition or not\n- this test shows if the baby is a carrier of sickle cell, and could one day have children of their own who have the condition (find out more about sickle cell carriers here)\n- the heel prick test identifies other inherited conditions, like cystic fibrosis\nAnother blood test will be used to confirm the diagnosis if the heel prick test suggests that the baby could have sickle cell disease.\nLearn about being tested to see if you carry the sickle cell gene\nPeople of all ages with sickle cell disease are supported by a team of medical professionals in a specialist sickle cell centre. A specialised care plan will be developed with you that helps you to fully understand the condition and find the best way of managing it.\nSickle cell crises can usually be managed at home. The following steps are recommended for adults or children experiencing a sickle cell crisis:\n- over the counter painkillers like paracetamol and ibuprofen can help – although aspirin should not be given to anyone under 16 – and if needed, your GP may prescribe stronger painkillers\n- heating pads or warm towels can be placed on the area and massaged to ease the pain – pharmacies usually sell heating pads you can use for this\n- drink plenty – staying hydrated will help\n- relaxing distractions like reading, videos, and computer games are a good way to distract your mind, or your child&#8217;s mind, from the pain\nIf none of the above measures help, or the pain is very severe, phone your GP. You or your child should go to the local accident and emergency (A&amp;E) if it&#8217;s not possible to contact your GP. It may be necessary for you or your child to spend a few days in hospital being treated with stronger pain relief.\nThe best way to prevent a sickle cell crisis is by being aware of potential triggers and avoiding them.\n- Prevent dehydration by drinking plenty of fluids –especially water.\n- Avoid alcohol – alcohol causes dehydration.\n- Stay warm with enough layers of clothing to avoid getting cold, and avoid extreme temperatures.\n- Don&#8217;t expose yourself to sudden changes in temperature – for example, avoid swimming in cold water.\n- The lack of oxygen at high altitudes can trigger a sickle cell crisis, so be careful if you&#8217;re at high altitude for any reason. However, plane travel shouldn&#8217;t be an issue because planes maintain a consistent oxygen level due to being pressurised.\n- Make sure to stay active, but avoid activities that leave you severely out of breath.\n- Don&#8217;t smoke – smoking can trigger acute chest syndrome.\n- Stay relaxed as much as you can – sickle cell crises can be triggered by stress, so consider learning relaxation techniques like breathing exercises.\nYour care team may recommend a medication called hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) if you keep experiencing sickle cell crises. This is a capsule that is taken once a day. It works by reducing how many other types of blood cell, like white blood cells and platelets (clotting cells) there are in the body.\nThis means that you&#8217;ll need regular blood tests to make sure you&#8217;re healthy.\nChildren who have sickle cell disease should be kept up to date on all of their routine vaccinations, and may also need additional vaccinations like the hepatitis B vaccine and the annual flu vaccine.\nIf you have sickle cell disease, you&#8217;ll most likely need to take a dose of antibiotics every day, usually penicillin. This will not pose serious health risks.\nReduce risk in day-to-day life by being careful about activities that can make you vulnerable to infection. Always follow good food hygiene measures, for example.\nIf you&#8217;re planning to go abroad, talk to your GP as far in advance as you can. You might need extra vaccinations or medication, such as anti-malarials if you&#8217;re going to a place where malaria is a risk. It may also be a good idea to take extra precautions when it comes to food and water.\nMost of the time, anaemia doesn&#8217;t have any symptoms and you won&#8217;t require any treatment for it. However, children with sickle cell anaemia who are also on a restricted diet (such as a vegan or vegetarian diet) may need folic acid supplements. Folic acid helps your body to create more red blood cells, so it can help to improve anaemia.\nIt&#8217;s important to be aware that this type of anaemia isn&#8217;t the same as the anaemia caused by iron deficiency, so don&#8217;t take iron supplements without talking to your care team first. Taking iron supplements with the anaemia caused by sickle cell disease can be dangerous.\nBlood transfusions or hydroxycarbamide may be necessary for serious or persistent anaemia.\nThere are a range of treatments for other problems that can be caused by sickle cell disease, depending on the type of symptom and how severe it is:\n- people with acute chest syndrome need emergency treatment – this involves oxygen, blood transfusions, antibiotics, and fluids given through a vein, as well as possibly hydroxycarbamide to prevent it happening again\n- painkillers can treat joint and bone pain\n- a short course of hormones can be given to children in order to trigger delayed puberty\n- gallbladder removal surgery is used to treat gallstones\n- for persistent priapism, medication can stimulate blood flow, or a needle can be used to drain blood from the penis\n- regular blood transfusions or hydroxycarbamide are given to people who have had a stroke or who are at greater risk of having one\nIn addition to the treatments above, chelation therapy involves taking medication to make the level of iron in your blood lower, bringing it to safe levels. This treatment is given to people who need a lot of blood transfusions.\nLearn more about living with sickle cell disease here\nSickle cell disease is a lifelong illness, which can be managed well with treatment and self-help. In addition to preventing symptoms and crises as much as possible, there are a few things you can do that will make it easier to live with the condition and stay in the best possible health.\nIf you&#8217;re due to have surgery, or you&#8217;re brought in for surgery in an emergency, it&#8217;s very important you take some precautions.\nYou should tell your care team about any surgeries you have planned that involve a general anaesthetic.\nTell your surgeon on the day that you have sickle cell disease.\nGeneral anaesthetic can cause a number of problems, including increasing the risk of a sickle cell crisis. It&#8217;s important that you&#8217;re monitored closely during the surgery, and are given plenty of fluids as well as being kept warm.\nIt might be necessary to have a blood transfusion before the surgery to reduce the chances of complications.\nYou can have a healthy pregnancy if you have sickle cell disease, but it&#8217;s a good idea to talk to your care team before planning a pregnancy, for a number of reasons:\n- there&#8217;s a bigger chance of complications such as miscarriage, pre-eclampsia, anaemia and sickle cell pain while you&#8217;re pregnant\n- you may have to stop taking some of the medications for sickle cell disease, like hydroxycarbamide, before getting pregnant, as these can harm a foetus\n- it may be a good idea to find out if your partner is a sickle cell carrier and talk with a counsellor about what this could mean\n- extra monitoring during pregnancy, as well as extra treatment, might be necessary\nIt&#8217;s important to use a reliable form of contraception if you aren&#8217;t planning a pregnancy.\nLearn about pregnancy and newborn screening for sickle cell disease\nMost children with sickle cell disease lead normal, happy lives. However, sickle cell disease can be very different from person to person, and it&#8217;s still a serious condition.\nSickle cell disease can have a big impact on someone&#8217;s life. It can lead to serious infections, strokes and transcient ischaemic attacks (TIAs), and lung problems, which can be fatal.\nThe overall live expectancy for people with sickle cell disease is shorter than normal, but this changes depending on the type of sickle cell disease, what problems they experience, and how the condition is treated.\nMilder types of sickle cell disease may not impact life expectancy. People with sickle cell anaemia have a typical life expectancy of between 40 and 60 years of age. As newer treatments are developed, it&#8217;s hoped that the outlook will get better.\nSickle cell disease is caused by a gene problem that is inherited from your parents. It isn&#8217;t something you can catch, and it&#8217;s not caused by anything the parents did during or before pregnancy.\nYou inherit one set of genes from your mother, and one from your father. Genes always come in pairs. Children born with sickle cell disease inherit a copy of the sickle cell gene from both of their parents, so each one of the pair of genes is faulty.\nThis happens when both parents are &#8220;carriers&#8221; – they carry the faulty gene for sickle cell. This is also known as having the sickle cell trait.\nCarriers don&#8217;t have sickle cell disease, but if their partner is a carrier too they may have a child with the condition.\nWhen both of a child&#8217;s parents are sickle cell carriers:\n- there&#8217;s a 25% (one in four) chance that each of their children won&#8217;t inherit any faulty genes – they won&#8217;t have sickle cell disease, and they won&#8217;t be able to pass it on to their children\n- there&#8217;s a 50% (one in two) chance that each child will inherit a copy of the faulty gene from just one parent, and be a sickle cell carrier\n- there&#8217;s a 25% (one in four) chance that each child will inherit copies of the sickle cell gene from both of their parents, and have sickle cell disease when they&#8217;re born\nYou can find more information about how sickle cell disease is inherited from the Sickle Cell Society.\nLearn more about sickle cell carriers and screening\nSickle cell disease carriers are people who carry the faulty gene that causes sickle cell disease, but do not have the disease. This is also called having the sickle cell trait.\nIf you have the sickle cell trait, you won&#8217;t develop sickle cell disease. However, there&#8217;s a risk that you&#8217;ll have a child with the condition, or who is also a sickle cell disease carrier.\nThe sickle cell gene can be carried by anyone, but people from certain ethnic backgrounds are much more likely to be carriers.\nYou are more likely to be a carrier if you have family from one of these areas :\n- Africa\n- Asia\n- The Caribbean\n- The Eastern Mediterranean\n- The Middle East\nMost sickle cell carriers in the UK have an African or Caribbean family background – it&#8217;s estimated around one in ten people with this background may be a sickle cell carrier.\nYou can request a blood test from your GP at any time to find out if you&#8217;re a sickle cell carrier. This is a particularly good idea if your family background makes it more likely that you have the gene.\nBoth men and women are able to get the test.\nEvery pregnant woman in Scotland is offered screening to check if their baby is at risk of being born with sickle cell disease. You can ask for a test even if your family background doesn&#8217;t suggest your child will have sickle cell disease. It&#8217;s a good idea to have your partner screened for the gene too.\nIf possible, screening should be done before the tenth week of pregnancy, so that there&#8217;s time to think about further tests that can find out if your baby will be born with sickle cell disease.\nRead more about diagnosis and screening for the sickle cell disease gene here\nYou&#8217;re not at risk of developing sickle cell disease if you carry sickle cell.\nThe only time you may be at risk of health problems is in rare cases where you might not get enough oxygen, such as:\n- having surgery under&nbsp;general anaesthetic&nbsp;– make sure your medical team know&nbsp;you carry sickle cell before your operation so they can ensure you get enough oxygen\n- during extreme sports such as deep sea diving and climbing at high altitudes – if you do sports like these, ensure you&#8217;re never short of oxygen\n- during regular, intensive physical activity – make sure you drink plenty of fluids during training and avoid extreme exhaustion\nThere&#8217;s also a very small risk of developing kidney problems associated with carrying sickle cell.\nApart from these uncommon situations, you can lead a completely normal and healthy life if you&#8217;re a sickle cell carrier.\nSickle cell carriers are also at risk of having a child with a blood disorder if their partner is a carrier of a different type of blood disorder.\nYou can find more detailed information about some of the other types of carrier in the following pages:&nbsp;\n- Your baby carries a gene for Sickle Cell\n- Your baby carries a gene for unusual haemoglobin&nbsp;"

        "disease": "Sinusitis",
        "description": "Sinusitis is inflammation (redness and swelling) of the sinuses. The sinuses are small, air-filled spaces in your cheekbones and forehead. Inflammation blocks the sinuses so mucus cannot drain into your nose as usual.\nSinusitis is usually caused by a viral infection. It&#8217;s common and usually gets better within 2 to 3 weeks.\nSinusitis usually occurs after an infection, such as a cold.\nSymptoms of sinusitis include:\n- a green or yellow discharge from your nose\n- a blocked nose\n- pain and tenderness around your cheeks, eyes or forehead\n- a high temperature (fever) of 38°C (100.4°F) or more\n- toothache\n- a reduced sense of smell\n- bad breath (halitosis)\nChildren with sinusitis may:\n- be irritable\n- breathe through their mouth\n- have difficulty feeding\n- sound nasal when they speak, as though they have a stuffy cold\nThe symptoms of sinusitis often clear up within a few weeks (acute sinusitis). Occasionally they can last 3 months or more (chronic sinusitis).\nIf your symptoms are mild and getting better, you can often treat sinusitis without seeing a GP.\nYour GP will usually be able to diagnose sinusitis from your symptoms and by examining the inside of your nose.\nIf you keep getting sinusitis, or its severe, they may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist.\nSinusitis usually gets better on its own within 2 or 3 weeks.\nAlways read the leaflet that comes with your medicine before taking it. Follow the recommended dosage instructions. If you’re not sure which treatments are suitable for you or your child, speak to a pharmacist for advice.\nYou do not need to use all of the solution, but make a fresh solution each time you clean your nose.\nIf your symptoms aren’t improving or are getting worse, your GP may prescribe antibiotics tablets or corticosteroid spray or drops.\nIf your symptoms still don’t get better, you may be referred to an ENT specialist for surgery to improve the drainage of your sinuses.\nSinusitis is usually caused by a cold or flu virus spreading to the sinuses from the upper airways. Only a few cases are caused by bacteria infecting the sinuses.\nAn infected tooth or fungal infection can also occasionally cause the sinuses to become inflamed.\nIt’s not clear exactly what causes sinusitis to become chronic (long-lasting), but it may be related to:\n- allergies and related conditions, including allergic rhinitis, asthma and hay fever\n- nasal polyps (benign growths inside the nose)\n- smoking\n- a weakened immune system\nControlling underlying conditions like allergies may improve the symptoms of chronic sinusitis."

        "disease": "Sjogren’s syndrome",
        "description": "Sjögren&#8217;s (pronounced Show-grin&#8217;s) syndrome is an autoimmune disorder. The body’s immune system attacks glands that secrete fluid, such as the tear and saliva glands.\nThe effects of&nbsp;Sjögren&#8217;s syndrome can be widespread. Certain glands become inflamed, which reduces the production of tears and saliva, causing the main symptoms of Sjögren&#8217;s syndrome, which are&nbsp;dry eyes and dry mouth.\nIn women (who are most commonly affected), the glands that keep the vagina moist can also be affected, leading to vaginal dryness.\nRead&nbsp;more about the&nbsp;symptoms of Sjögren’s syndrome\nSjögren&#8217;s syndrome is an autoimmune condition, which means that instead of protecting the body from infection or illness, the immune system reacts abnormally and starts attacking healthy cells and tissue.\nIn Sjögren&#8217;s syndrome, the immune system attacks the tear and saliva glands,&nbsp;and other secretory glands throughout the body.\nThe reasons for this remains unknown, but research suggests that it&#8217;s triggered by a combination of genetic, environmental and, possibly, hormonal factors.\nSome people are thought to be more vulnerable to the syndrome when they&#8217;re born and that certain events, such an infection, can trigger the problems with the immune system.\nRead more about the causes of Sjögren’s syndrome\nHealthcare professionals classify Sjögren&#8217;s syndrome as being either:\n- primary – when the syndrome develops by itself and not as the result of another condition\n- secondary – when the syndrome develops in combination with another autoimmune disorder, such as&nbsp;lupus or rheumatoid arthritis\nSjögren&#8217;s syndrome can be difficult to diagnose, because&nbsp;it has similar symptoms to other conditions and there is no single test for it.\nYour doctor will ask about your symptoms and carry out a test to see how dry your mouth and eyes are.\nRead more about diagnosing Sjögren&#8217;s syndrome\nThere is no cure for Sjögren&#8217;s syndrome, but treatments can help control symptoms.\nDry eyes and mouth can usually be&nbsp;helped with artificial tears and saliva.\nIt&#8217;s important to maintain good eye and mouth hygiene, because your risk of developing an infection is greater. Taking care of your eyes and mouth can help prevent problems such as&nbsp;corneal ulcers and tooth decay.\nIn severe cases, medication or surgery may be recommended.\nRead more about treating Sjögren&#8217;s syndrome\nSjögren&#8217;s syndrome can sometimes lead to complications. For example, your eyesight could be permanently damaged if the reduced tear production isn&#8217;t treated.\nSjögren&#8217;s syndrome also increases your risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which is&nbsp;a cancer of the lymph glands. However, the chances&nbsp;are still low, at around 5%.\nWomen with Sjögren&#8217;s syndrome have an increased risk of having children with a temporary &#8220;lupus&#8221; rash&nbsp;or heart abnormalities. Any pregnancy will be closely monitored for potential problems.\nRead more about the&nbsp;complications of Sjögren’s syndrome\nSjögren&#8217;s syndrome most commonly affects people aged 40-60, with women accounting for about 90% of cases.\nIt’s difficult to know exactly how many people are affected by the syndrome because many don&#8217;t see their GP about their symptoms.\nFurther information on&nbsp;Sjögren&#8217;s syndrome\nIf you have Sjögren&#8217;s syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).\nThis helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.\nFind out more about the register\nThe most commonly reported symptoms of Sjögren&#8217;s syndrome are a dry mouth and eyes, which can lead to other associated symptoms.\nHowever, these symptoms can be common in old age, and most people with&nbsp;dry eyes or a dry mouth do not have Sjögren&#8217;s syndrome.\nMany women also experience vaginal dryness, which can make sex painful.\nA&nbsp;dry mouth can lead to:\n- tooth decay&nbsp;and gum disease\n- dry&nbsp;cough\n- difficulty swallowing and chewing\n- hoarse voice\n- difficulty speaking\n- swollen salivary glands (located between your jaw and ears)\n- repeated fungal infections in the mouth (oral thrush) – symptoms of which can include a coated or white tongue\nDry eyes can lead to:\n- burning or stinging eyes\n- itchy eyes\n- a feeling that there&#8217;s grit in your eyes\n- irritated and swollen eyelids\n- sensitivity to light (photophobia)\n- tired eyes\n- mucus&nbsp;discharge from your eyes\nThese symptoms can get worse when you&#8217;re:\n- in a windy or smoky environment\n- in an air-conditioned building\n- travelling on aeroplane\nIn more serious cases of Sjögren&#8217;s syndrome, the immune system can attack other parts of the body, causing symptoms and conditions such as:\n- dry skin\n- tiredness and fatigue – which are common and can lead to total exhaustion\n- muscle pain\n- joint pain, stiffness and swelling\n- vasculitis&nbsp;(inflammation of blood vessels)\n- difficulty concentrating, remembering and reasoning\nIt&#8217;s not known exactly what causes Sjögren&#8217;s syndrome, but it&#8217;s thought to be linked to a problem with the immune system.\nYour immune system usually helps protect the body from infection and illness by making antibodies. Antibodies attack bacteria and viruses, which help stop you from becoming ill.\nAn autoimmune condition causes your immune system to react abnormally. Instead of attacking foreign cells, such as bacteria, the antibodies start attacking your body&#8217;s healthy cells and tissue.\nIn Sjögren&#8217;s syndrome, the parts of the body usually affected are the tear, saliva and vaginal glands, which are collectively known as the exocrine glands.\nThe antibodies damage the exocrine glands so they can no longer function normally. There&#8217;s some evidence that the immune system also damages the nerves that control these glands, which further reduces their effectiveness.\nThe immune system can go on to damage other parts of the body, such as muscles, joints, blood vessels, nerves and, less commonly, organs.\nMost researchers believe that primary Sjögren&#8217;s syndrome is triggered by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.\nCertain people are born with specific genes that make them more vulnerable to a faulty immune system. Then, many years later, an environmental factor, possibly a common virus, triggers the immune system to stop working properly.\nThe female hormone oestrogen also seems to play&nbsp;a role. Sjögren&#8217;s syndrome mostly occurs in women, and symptoms usually start around the time of the menopause, when oestrogen levels begin to fall. Falling oestrogen levels can contribute to dryness, and this dryness&nbsp;could make the&nbsp;condition more noticeable.\nSjögren’s syndrome can be associated with other autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. This is known as secondary Sjögren’s syndrome.\nYour saliva and tear glands play a vital role in protecting your mouth and eyes, which is why the symptoms of&nbsp;Sjögren&#8217;s syndrome can be widespread and troublesome.\nWe usually only notice our tears when we cry, but our eyes are always covered by a thin layer of tears, known as a tear film.\nTears are made up of a mix of water, proteins, fats, mucus and infection-fighting cells. Tears serve several important functions. They:\n- lubricate the eye\n- keep the eye clean and free of dust\n- protect the eye against infection\n- help stabilise your vision\nSaliva also serves several important functions, including:\n- keeping the mouth and throat naturally lubricated\n- aiding digestion by moistening food and containing enzymes that can break down certain starches\n- acting as a natural disinfectant (saliva contains antibodies, enzymes and proteins that protect against some common bacterial and fungal infections)\nSjögren&#8217;s syndrome can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms are similar to those of other health conditions.\nYou may see different health professionals&nbsp;for your&nbsp;different symptoms, such as a dentist for a&nbsp;dry mouth, an optician for&nbsp;dry eyes and a gynaecologist for&nbsp;a&nbsp;dry vagina, which can sometimes make it difficult to reach a firm diagnosis.\nSee&nbsp;your GP if you experience any symptoms of dryness, particularly of your eyes and mouth.\nExperts in the field have come up with a series of screening questions, which may be useful if you&#8217;re worried you may have Sjögren&#8217;s syndrome.\nIf you answer &#8220;yes&#8221; to most of the questions below, you may have Sjögren&#8217;s syndrome and will probably be advised to have further tests.\n- Have you had daily, persistent, troublesome dry eyes for more than three months?\n- Do you keep having a sensation of grit in your eye?\n- Do you need to use eye drops containing tear substitutes more than three times a day?\n- Have you had a daily feeling of dry mouth for more than three months?\n- Do you keep getting swollen salivary glands (located between your jaw and your ears)?\n- Do you frequently drink liquids to help you swallow food?\nTests used to diagnose&nbsp;Sjögren&#8217;s syndrome include:\n- tear break-up time and Schirmer tests\n- a lip biopsy\n- blood tests\n- salivary flow rate\nThese are explained below.\nTear break-up time and Schirmer tests are usually carried out by an ophthalmologist (a doctor who specialises in treating eye conditions).\nThe tear break-up time test measures how effective your tear glands are.&nbsp;A non-toxic dye is dropped onto the surface of your eye and the&nbsp;colour of the dye allows the ophthalmologist to see how well your tear film is functioning and how long it takes for your tears to evaporate.\nThis test is also carried out&nbsp;using a slit lamp. A slit lamp is a low-power microscope with a high-intensity light source that can be focused to shine in a&nbsp;narrow beam. The specialist will use the slit lamp to examine your tear glands more closely.\nIn the Schirmer test, small strips of blotting paper are placed into your lower eyelid. After five minutes, the strips are removed to see how much of the paper is soaked with tears.\nDuring a lip biopsy, a small tissue&nbsp;sample&nbsp;is removed from your inner lip and examined under a microscope. A local anaesthetic&nbsp;is&nbsp;injected into&nbsp;the inner surface of your lower lip to numb the area, before a small cut is made to remove a few of your minor salivary glands.\nClusters of lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) in the tissue can indicate Sjögren&#8217;s syndrome.\nBlood tests&nbsp;are carried out to look for antibodies known as anti-Ro and anti-La (or SS-A and SS-B), which are produced when the immune system has been affected by Sjögren&#8217;s syndrome.\nThese antibodies are only present in about 60% of people with Sjögren’s syndrome, so it&#8217;s possible to have a negative blood test result and still have the condition.\nA salivary flow rate test measures how much saliva your glands produce.\nYou&#8217;ll usually be asked to spit as much saliva as you can into a cup&nbsp;over a five-minute period. The amount of saliva is then weighed or measured. An unusually low flow rate can indicate Sjögren&#8217;s syndrome.\nThere&#8217;s no cure for Sjögren&#8217;s syndrome, but treatments help relieve symptoms such as eye and mouth dryness.\nSjögren&#8217;s syndrome affects everyone in different ways, so your treatment plan will be&nbsp;tailored to suit you.\nMild to moderate cases of dry eye can usually be successfully treated with eye drops containing &#8220;artificial tears&#8221; – a liquid that mimics tears. These eye drops are available from a pharmacist, without a prescription.\nThere are many different types of eye drops, so you can try different brands to find the one that works best for you. If you&#8217;re using eye drops regularly (more than three times a day), you should use one that doesn&#8217;t contain&nbsp;preservatives. This is because there&#8217;s evidence that over-exposure to preservatives can damage the surface of the eye.\nA short-term dose of eye drops containing corticosteroids may be recommended if your eyes become irritated. However,&nbsp;long-term corticosteroid use isn&#8217;t recommended because they can cause serious side effects.\nTo minimise the chance of experiencing side effects from corticosteroids, you&#8217;ll be prescribed the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time.\nWearing glasses reduces tear evaporation by up to 30%, and this effect can be maximised by wearing specially-made glasses called moisture chamber spectacles. These wrap around your eyes like goggles and help retain moisture and protect the eyes from irritants.\nSome people used to be embarrassed to&nbsp;wear them, but modern designs look like sports glasses.\nPunctual occlusion is a widely-used technique that seals the tear ducts (into which the tears drain) with small plugs. This should help keep&nbsp;the eye better protected by tears.\nTemporary plugs made of silicone are usually used first to see if they help. If it does, more permanent plugs can be used.\nA&nbsp;number of techniques can be used to keep your mouth lubricated, including:\n- maintaining good oral hygiene to&nbsp;prevent tooth decay and&nbsp;gum disease\n- increasing your fluid intake\n- using sugar-free chewing gum to stimulate saliva production\n- sucking ice cubes to help lubricate your mouth and reduce dryness\n- regularly using mouth rinses to soothe&nbsp;your mouth and protect it against infection\nIf you smoke, you should try to quit. Smoking irritates the mouth and increases the rate at which saliva evaporates.\nRead more about&nbsp;how to stop smoking\nThere are a number of saliva substitute products that can help lubricate your mouth. However, they don&#8217;t replicate the role of&nbsp;saliva in preventing infection, so you&#8217;ll still need to maintain excellent oral hygiene.\nSaliva substitutes are available as a spray, lozenge (medicated sweet), gel, or gum. Your GP or pharmacist can tell you which product is most suitable for you.\nThe medicine pilocarpine is often used to treat the symptoms of dry eyes and dry mouth. Pilocarpine stimulates the glands to produce more saliva and tears.\nSide effects of pilocarpine include:\n- hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating)\n- nausea\n- diarrhoea&nbsp;\n- heartburn\n- abdominal (stomach) pain\n- an increased need to go to the toilet\nFor some people, the side effects of pilocarpine are mild. Others find that the side effects outweigh the benefits.\nDon&#8217;t take pilocarpine if you have&nbsp;asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or if you&#8217;re pregnant or breastfeeding.\nHydroxychloroquine has been shown to slow down the immune system&#8217;s attack on the tear and saliva glands. It can also help reduce any associated symptoms of muscle pain, joint pain and stiffness.\nYou&#8217;ll need to take hydroxychloroquine for several weeks before you notice any improvements, and it could be six months before you experience the full benefit of the treatment.\nSide effects are uncommon and usually mild. They include:\n- nausea\n- skin rash\n- loss of appetite\n- stomach cramps\n- vomiting\nIn very rare cases, hydroxychloroquine can damage the retina, affecting vision. You&#8217;ll probably be asked to attend an eye examination so that your retina can be checked before you start treatment. Regular eye examinations (usually at least once a year) are also recommended after you begin treatment.\nHydroxychloroquine shouldn&#8217;t be used by breastfeeding women.\nSeveral soaps and creams are specifically designed for people with dry skin. Your pharmacist or GP can advise you.\nVaginal dryness can be treated using a lubricant. Some women also use oestrogen creams or hormone replacement therapy (HRT).\nMuscle and joint pains can be treated with an over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), such as ibuprofen. If this doesn&#8217;t work, see your GP, as stronger NSAIDs are available on prescription.\nNSAIDs can increase your risk of developing stomach ulcers and internal bleeding, particularly if they&#8217;re taken on a long-term basis.\nIf you find swallowing NSAIDs difficult because of your dry mouth, you can try an NSAID cream that&#8217;s rubbed into affected joints.\nNSAIDs aren&#8217;t recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women, or for people with pre-existing risk factors for cardiovascular or kidney conditions.\nThese&nbsp;simple tips can help prevent many of the problems associated with Sjögren&#8217;s syndrome:\n- have a dental check-up every six months\n- practise good dental hygiene – brushing, flossing and using mouthwash regularly\n- avoid eating too many sweet foods\n- avoid strong and perfumed soaps – use special creams and soaps from your pharmacist\n- avoid dry environments, such as air-conditioned offices, whenever possible\n- avoid drinking too much&nbsp;alcohol\nSjögren&#8217;s syndrome isn&#8217;t usually life-threatening, but it is linked to more seriousproblems.\nIt&#8217;s estimated that people with Sjögren&#8217;s syndrome are 44 times more likely to develop&nbsp;non-Hodgkin lymphoma than people without the condition.\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma is a&nbsp;cancer of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is a series of vessels and glands (lymph nodes) that are spread throughout your body, much like your blood vessels.\nWhile this increased risk may sound alarming, the chance of a person with Sjögren’s syndrome developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma is still small, as it only affects around 5% of people with the syndrome.\nHowever, if you have Sjögren’s syndrome, you should be aware of the main early symptom of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which is a painless swelling in a lymph node (gland) – usually in the neck, armpit or groin. Report any swollen lymph nodes to your GP.\nIf dry eyes aren&#8217;t treated, they can&nbsp;become inflamed and you can develop ulcers on the surface of your&nbsp;eyes (corneal ulcers).\nIf left untreated, corneal ulcers can lead to loss of vision and permanent sight damage.\nIf you&#8217;re planning to become pregnant and have Sjögren&#8217;s syndrome, ask your GP to test for certain antibodies that may be present in Sjögren&#8217;s syndrome and are known to cause a temporary&nbsp;lupus rash in newborn babies. In very rare cases, the antibodies can also cause heart defects in babies.\nIf these antibodies are found, there should be no reason why you can&#8217;t continue with the pregnancy, but your child may need additional specialist care during pregnancy and after the birth.\nRead more about&nbsp;antenatal appointments\nA number of other conditions have been linked to Sjögren&#8217;s syndrome, including:&nbsp;\n- peripheral neuropathy – a condition that often involves loss of sensation in the hands and feet\n- Raynaud&#8217;s phenomenon&nbsp;– restricted blood flow to the hands, which can cause them to feel cold, numb and painful\n- kidney problems – such as inflammation or kidney stones\n- an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) – which can lead to tiredness and weight gain\n- irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) – which can cause abdominal pain and irregular bowel movements\n- teeth cavities"

        "description": "Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that can spread to other organs in the body.\nThe most common sign of melanoma is the appearance of a new&nbsp;mole or a change in an existing mole. This can happen anywhere on the body, but the back, legs, arms and face are most commonly affected.\nIn most cases, melanomas have an irregular shape and more than 1 colour. They may also be larger than normal moles and can sometimes be itchy or bleed.\nAn &#8216;ABCDE checklist&#8217; has been developed for people to tell the difference between a normal mole and a melanoma.&nbsp;\nRead more about the symptoms of melanoma.\nThese pages mainly cover a type of melanoma known as superficial spreading melanoma, which accounts for around 70% of all melanomas in the UK.\nNodular melanoma is a fast-developing type of melanoma, most common in middle-aged people. It may not develop from an existing mole and can appear in areas of skin that aren&#8217;t regularly exposed to the sun.\nLentigo maligna melanoma is most common in elderly people and those who have spent a lot of time outdoors. It is common on the face and tends to grow slowly over a number of years.\nAcral lentiginous melanoma&nbsp;is&nbsp;a rare type of melanoma that usually appears on the palms of the hands and the soles or big toenails of the feet. This is the most common type of melanoma in people with dark skin.\nCancer Research UK has more information about the different types of melanoma.\nMelanoma happens when some cells in the skin begin to develop abnormally. It&#8217;s thought that exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light from natural or artificial sources may be partly responsible.\nCertain things can increase your chances of developing melanoma, such as having:\n- lots of moles or freckles\n- pale skin that burns easily\n- red or blonde hair\n- a family member who has had melanoma\nRead more about the causes of melanoma.\nSpeak to your GP if you notice any change to your moles. Your GP will refer you to a specialist clinic or hospital if they think you have melanoma.\nIn most cases, a suspicious mole will be surgically removed and studied to see if it is cancerous. This is known as a biopsy.\nYou may also have a test to check if the melanoma has spread elsewhere in your body. This is known as a&nbsp;sentinel node biopsy.\nRead more about diagnosing melanoma.\nThe main treatment for melanoma is surgery, although your treatment will depend on your circumstances.\nIf melanoma is diagnosed and treated at an&nbsp;early stage, surgery is usually successful.\nIf melanoma isn&#8217;t diagnosed until an advanced stage, treatment is mainly used to slow the spread of the cancer and reduce symptoms. This usually involves medicines, such as chemotherapy.\nRead more about treating melanoma.\nOnce&nbsp;you&nbsp;have had melanoma, there is a chance it may return. This risk is increased if your cancer was widespread and severe.\nIf your cancer team feels there is a significant risk of your melanoma returning, you will probably need regular check-ups to monitor your health. You will also be taught how to examine your skin and lymph nodes to help detect melanoma if it returns.\nMelanoma is the 5th most common cancer in the UK.\nMore than a quarter of cases are diagnosed in people under 50, which is unusual compared to most other types of cancer. It&#8217;s also becoming more common in the UK over time, thought to be caused by increased exposure to UV light from the sun and sunbeds.\nMelanoma is not always preventable, but you can reduce your chances of developing it by limiting your exposure to UV light.\nYou can help protect yourself from sun damage by using sunscreen and dressing sensibly in the sun. Sunbeds and sunlamps should also be avoided.\nRegularly checking your&nbsp;moles and freckles&nbsp;can help lead to early diagnosis and increase your chances of successful treatment.\nThe first sign of a melanoma is often a new mole or a change in the appearance of an existing mole.\nNormal&nbsp;moles are usually round or oval, with a smooth edge, and&nbsp;no&nbsp;bigger than 6mm (1/4 inch) in diameter.\nSpeak to your GP as soon as possible if you notice changes in a mole, freckle or patch of skin, especially if the changes happen over a few weeks or months.\nSigns to look out for include a mole that is:\n- getting bigger\n- changing shape\n- changing colour\n- bleeding or becoming crusty\n- itchy or painful\nA&nbsp;helpful&nbsp;way to tell the difference between a normal mole and a melanoma is the ABCDE checklist:\n- Asymmetrical – melanomas have 2 very different halves and are an irregular shape\n- Border – melanomas have a notched or ragged border\n- Colours – melanomas will be a mix of 2 or more colours\n- Diameter – melanomas are larger than 6mm (1/4 inch) in diameter.\n- Enlargement or elevation – a mole that changes size over time&nbsp;is more likely to be a melanoma\nMelanomas can appear anywhere on your body, but they most commonly&nbsp;appear on the&nbsp;back, legs, arms and face. They may sometimes develop underneath a nail.\nIn rare cases, melanoma can develop in&nbsp;the eye. Noticing a dark spot or changes in vision can be signs, although it is more likely to be&nbsp;diagnosed during a routine eye examination.\nRead further information:\n- Cancer Research UK: Symptoms of melanoma skin cancer\nMost skin cancer is caused by ultraviolet (UV) light damaging the DNA in skin cells. The main source of UV light is sunlight.\nSunlight contains 3 types of UV light:\n- ultraviolet A (UVA)\n- ultraviolet B (UVB)\n- ultraviolet C (UVC)\nUVC is filtered out by the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, but UVA and UVB damage skin over time, making it more likely for skin cancers to develop. UVB is thought to be the main cause of skin cancer.\nArtificial sources of light, such as sunlamps and tanning beds, also increase your risk of developing skin cancer.\nRepeated sunburn, either by the sun or artificial sources of light, increases the risk of melanoma in people of all ages.\nYou&nbsp;are at an increased&nbsp;risk of melanoma if you have&nbsp;lots of&nbsp;moles&nbsp;on your body, especially if they are large&nbsp;(over 5mm) or unusually shaped.\nHaving just 1 unusually shaped or very large mole increases your risk of melanoma by 60%.\nFor this reason, it&#8217;s important to monitor moles for changes and avoid exposing them to the sun.\nResearch suggests that if you have 2 or more close relatives who have had non-melanoma skin cancer, your chances of developing the condition may be increased.\nCertain&nbsp;things&nbsp;are believed to increase your chances of developing all types of skin cancer, including:\n- pale skin that does not tan easily\n- red or blonde hair\n- blue eyes\n- older age\n- a large number of freckles\n- an area of skin previously damaged by burning or radiotherapy treatment\n- a condition that suppresses your immune system – such as HIV\n- medicines that suppress your immune system (immunosuppressants) – commonly used after organ transplants\n- exposure to certain chemicals – such as creosote and arsenic\n- a previous diagnosis of skin cancer\nRead further information:\n- Cancer Research UK: Risks and causes of melanoma\nA diagnosis of melanoma will usually begin with an examination of your skin. Your GP will refer you to a specialist if they suspect melanoma.\nSome GPs take digital photographs of suspected tumours so they can email them to a specialist for assessment.\nAs melanoma is a relatively rare condition, many GPs will only see a case every few years. It&#8217;s important&nbsp;to monitor your moles and return to your GP if you notice any changes. Taking photos to document any changes will help with diagnosis.\nIn 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of malignant melanoma and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected&nbsp;malignant melanoma, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral.\nYou will be referred to a dermatology clinic or hospital&nbsp;for further testing if melanoma is suspected. You should see a specialist within 2 weeks of seeing your GP.\nThe&nbsp;dermatologist&nbsp;or plastic surgeon will examine the mole and the rest of your skin. They may&nbsp;also remove the mole and send it for testing (biopsy) to&nbsp;check whether the mole is cancerous. A biopsy is usually carried out under local anaesthetic,&nbsp;meaning the area around the mole will be numbed and you won&#8217;t feel any pain.\nIf cancer is confirmed, you will usually need a further operation, most often carried out by a plastic surgeon, to remove a wider area&nbsp;of skin.\nFurther tests will be carried out if there is a concern the cancer has spread into other organs, bones or your bloodstream.\nIf melanoma spreads, it will usually begin spreading through channels in the skin (called lymphatics) to the nearest group of glands (called lymph nodes).&nbsp;Lymph nodes&nbsp;are part of the body’s immune system, helping to remove unwanted bacteria and particles from the body.\nSentinel lymph node biopsy is a test to determine whether microscopic amounts of melanoma (less than would show up on any X-ray or scan) might have spread to the lymph nodes. It is usually carried out by a specialist plastic surgeon, while you are under general anaesthetic.\nA combination of blue dye and a weak radioactive chemical is injected around your scar. This is usually done just before the wider&nbsp;area&nbsp;of skin is removed. The solution follows the same channels in the skin as any melanoma.\nThe first lymph node this reaches&nbsp;is known as&nbsp;the &#8216;sentinel&#8217; lymph node. The surgeon can&nbsp;locate and remove the sentinel node, leaving the others intact. The node is then examined for microscopic specks of melanoma&nbsp;(this process can take several weeks).\nIf the sentinel lymph node is clear of melanoma, it&#8217;s extremely unlikely that any other lymph nodes are affected. This can be reassuring&nbsp;because if melanoma spreads to the lymph nodes, it&#8217;s more likely to spread elsewhere.\nIf the sentinel lymph node contains melanoma, there is a risk that other lymph nodes in the same group will contain melanoma.\nYour surgeon should discuss the pros and cons of having a sentinel lymph node biopsy before you agree to the procedure. Sentinel lymph node biopsy does not cure melanoma, but&nbsp;is used to investigate the outlook of your condition.\nAn operation to remove the remaining lymph nodes in the group&nbsp;may be recommended. This is known as a completion lymph node dissection or completion lymphadenectomy.\nOther tests you may have include:\n- a computerised tomography (CT) scan\n- a magnetic resonance imaging&nbsp;(MRI) scan\n- a positron emission tomography (PET) scan\n- blood tests\nRead further information:\n- Cancer Research UK: Tests for melanoma skin cancer\nHealth professionals use a staging system to describe how far melanoma has grown into the skin (the thickness) and whether it has spread. The type of treatment you receive will depend on what stage the melanoma has reached.\nThe melanoma stages can be described as:\n- stage 0 – the melanoma is on the surface of the skin\n- stage 1A – the melanoma is less than 1mm thick\n- stage 1B – the melanoma is 1 to 2mm thick, or the melanoma is less than 1mm thick and the surface of the skin is broken (ulcerated) or its cells are dividing faster than usual (mitotic activity)\n- stage 2A – the melanoma is 2 to 4mm thick, or the melanoma is 1 to 2mm thick and is ulcerated\n- stage 2B – the melanoma is thicker than 4mm, or the melanoma is 2 to 4mm thick and ulcerated\n- stage 2C – the melanoma is thicker than 4mm and ulcerated\n- stage 3A – the melanoma has spread into 1 to 3 nearby lymph nodes, but they are not enlarged; the melanoma is not ulcerated and has not spread further\n- stage 3B – the melanoma is ulcerated and has spread into 1&nbsp;to 3 nearby lymph nodes but they are not enlarged, or the melanoma is not ulcerated and has spread into 1 to 3 nearby lymph nodes and they are enlarged, or the melanoma has spread to small areas of skin or lymphatic channels, but not to nearby lymph nodes\n- stage 3C – the melanoma is ulcerated and has spread into 1 to 3 nearby lymph nodes and they are enlarged, or&nbsp;the melanoma has spread into 4 or more lymph nodes nearby\n- stage 4 – the melanoma cells have spread to other areas of the body, such as the lungs, brain or other parts of the skin\nRead further information:\n- Cancer Research UK: Treating melanoma\n- Cancer Research UK: Stages and types of melanoma\n- Macmillan Cancer Support: Melanoma\nTreating stage 1 melanoma will involve surgically removing the melanoma and a small area of skin around it – this is known as surgical excision.\nSurgical excision&nbsp;is usually&nbsp;carried out&nbsp;under local anaesthetic. This means you will be awake but the area around the melanoma will be numbed, so you won&#8217;t feel pain. In some cases, general anaesthetic is used, which means you will be asleep during the procedure.\nIf a surgical excision is likely to leave a significant scar, it may be done in combination with a skin graft. A skin graft involves removing a patch of healthy skin, usually&nbsp;taken from a part of your body where scarring cannot be seen, such as your back. It is then connected, or grafted, to the affected area. Skin grafts or flaps are used when the area of skin being removed is too big to close using a direct method.\nOnce the melanoma has been removed, there is little possibility it will return and no further treatment should be required. You will probably be asked to come for follow-up appointments before being discharged.&nbsp;\nAs with stage&nbsp;1 melanomas, any affected areas of skin will be removed.&nbsp;The remaining skin is&nbsp;either closed directly, or a skin graft or flap may be&nbsp;carried out&nbsp;if necessary.\nSentinel node biopsy, which is not a mandatory procedure, will be discussed with you. If you decide to go ahead&nbsp;with the procedure&nbsp;and the results show no spread to nearby lymph nodes, it is unlikely you will have further problems with this melanoma.\nIf the test confirms melanoma has spread to nearby nodes, your specialist will discuss with you whether further surgery is required. Additional surgery involves removing the remaining nodes, known as a completion lymph node&nbsp;dissection or completion lymphadenectomy.\nIf the melanoma has spread to nearby lymph nodes, you may need further surgery to remove them. Your doctor will&nbsp;have felt a lump in your lymph nodes and&nbsp;the diagnosis of melanoma is usually confirmed using a needle biopsy (fine needle aspiration).&nbsp;Removing the affected nodes requires a procedure called a block dissection, performed under general anaesthetic.\nWhile the surgeon will try to ensure&nbsp;the rest of your lymphatic system can function normally, there is a risk that the removal of lymph nodes will disrupt the lymphatic system, leading to a build-up of fluids in your limbs. This is known as lymphoedema.\nOnce the melanoma has been removed, you will need follow-up appointments to see how you are recovering and to watch for any sign of the melanoma returning.\nYou may be offered treatment to try to prevent the melanoma&nbsp;returning. This is called adjuvant treatment. There is not much evidence that adjuvant treatment helps prevent melanoma from coming back, so this is only offered as part of a clinical trial.\nIt may not be possible to cure melanoma if it has:\n- been&nbsp;diagnosed at its most advanced stage\n- spread to another part of your body (metastasis)\n- come back in another part of your body after treatment (recurrent cancer)\nTreatment is available and given in the hope that it can slow the cancer&#8217;s growth, reduce any symptoms you may have and possibly extend your life expectancy.\nYou may be able to have surgery to remove other melanomas that have occurred away from the original site.\nYou may also be able to have other treatments to help with symptoms. These include:\n- radiotherapy&nbsp;\n- drug treatments\nRadiotherapy&nbsp;may be used after an operation to remove your lymph nodes, and can also be used to help relieve the symptoms of advanced melanoma.\nRadiotherapy uses controlled doses of radiation to kill cancer cells. It is given at the hospital as a series of 10 to 15 minute daily sessions, with a rest period over the weekend.\nThe side effects of radiotherapy include:\n- tiredness\n- nausea\n- loss of appetite\n- hair loss\n- sore skin\nMany side effects can be prevented or controlled with medicines your doctor can prescribe, so let them know about any that you experience. After treatment has finished, the side effects of radiotherapy should gradually reduce.\nRead further information:\n- Cancer Research UK: Radiotherapy for melanoma\nIn recent years there have been major advancements in treating melanoma. The medications used to treat melanoma are changing as new formulations are being introduced into clinics.\nThe medications currently being used include:\n- vemurafenib\n- ipilimumab\n- nivolumab\nHowever, not everyone is suitable for these drugs. Your specialist will discuss an appropriate treatment with you, and many people are entered into clinical trials.\nChemotherapy&nbsp;involves using anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to kill the cancer.&nbsp;It is normally used to treat melanoma that has spread to parts of the body and is mainly given to help relieve symptoms of advanced melanoma.\nSeveral different chemotherapy drugs are used to treat melanoma and are occasionally given in combination. The drugs most commonly used for melanoma are dacarbazine and temozolomide. However, many different types of drugs can be used. Your specialist can discuss with you which drugs are the most suitable.\nChemotherapy is usually given as an outpatient treatment, which means you will not have to stay in hospital overnight. Dacarbazine is given through a drip and temozolomide is given in tablet form. Chemotherapy sessions are usually given once every 3 to 4 weeks, with gaps between treatment intended to give your body and blood time to recover.\nThe main side effects of chemotherapy are caused by their influence on the rest of the body. Side effects include infection, nausea and vomiting, tiredness and sore mouth. Many side effects can be prevented or controlled with medicines that your doctor can prescribe.\nElectrochemotherapy is a possible treatment for melanoma. It may be considered if:\n- surgery isn&#8217;t suitable or hasn&#8217;t worked\n- radiotherapy and chemotherapy haven&#8217;t worked\nThe procedure involves giving chemotherapy intravenously (directly into a vein).&nbsp;Short, powerful pulses of electricity are then directed to the tumour using electrodes.\nThese electrical pulses allow the medicine to enter the tumour cells more effectively and cause more damage to the tumour.&nbsp;The procedure&nbsp;is usually&nbsp;carried out using general anaesthetic (where you&#8217;re asleep) but some people may&nbsp;be able to have&nbsp;local anaesthetic&nbsp;(where you&#8217;re awake but the area is numbed).\nDepending on how many tumours need to be treated, the procedure can take up to an hour to complete. The main side effect is some pain where the electrode was used, which can last for a few days and may require painkillers.\nIt usually takes around 6 weeks for results to appear and the procedure usually needs to be repeated.\nYour specialist can give you more detailed information about this treatment option.\nRead the NICE (2013) guidelines on Electrochemotherapy for metastases in the skin.\nImmunotherapy uses drugs (often derived from substances that occur naturally in the body) that encourage your body&#8217;s immune system to work against the melanoma. Two such treatments in regular use for melanoma are&nbsp;interferon-alpha and interleukin-2. Both are given as an injection (into the blood, under the skin, or into lumps of melanoma).\nSide effects include flu-like symptoms, such as chills, a high temperature, joint pain and fatigue.\nThere is ongoing research&nbsp;into producing a vaccine for melanoma, either to treat advanced melanoma or to be used&nbsp;after surgery in patients who have a high risk of the melanoma coming back.\nVaccines are designed to focus the body’s immune system so it recognises the melanoma and can work against it. Vaccines are usually given as an injection under the skin every few weeks, often over a period of months.\nAs more research is needed into vaccines, they are only given as part of a clinical trial.\nOur immune systems make antibodies all the time, usually as a way of controlling infections. They are substances that recognise something which doesn’t belong in the body and help to destroy it. Antibodies can be produced in the laboratory and can be made to recognise and lock onto specific targets, either in the cancer or in specific parts of the body.\nAntibodies produced in the laboratory are usually called monoclonal antibodies.\nIpilimumab is a monoclonal antibody that has been licensed for use in the UK since 2011. It works like an accelerator for the immune system, allowing the body to work against all sorts of conditions, including cancer.\nIn December 2012, NICE recommended ipilimumab as a possible treatment for people with previously treated advanced melanoma that has spread or cannot be surgically removed.\nSignalling inhibitors are drugs that work by disrupting the messages (signals) a cancer uses to co-ordinate its growth. There are hundreds of these signals, and it is difficult to know which ones need to be blocked. Most of the signals have short, technical names. Two that are of current interest in relation to melanoma are BRAF and MEK.\nThere are drugs available that can interfere with these signals, but most are currently only widely available as part of clinical trials.\nNICE recommends a signalling inhibitor called vemurafenib as a possible treatment for melanoma that has spread or cannot be surgically removed.\nAll new treatment for cancer (and other diseases) is first given to patients in a clinical trial.\nA clinical trial or study is an extremely rigorous way of testing a drug on people. Patients are monitored for any effects of the drug on the cancer, as well as side effects. Many people with melanoma are offered entry into clinical trials, but some people are suspicious of the process.\nThere are a few key things to know about clinical trials:\n- overall, patients in clinical trials do better than those on routine treatment, even when receiving a drug that would be given routinely\n- all clinical trials are highly regulated\n- all new treatments will first become available through clinical trials\n- even where a new drug fails to offer any benefits over existing treatment, the knowledge that we gain from the trial is valuable for future patients\nIf you are asked to take part in a trial, you will be given an information sheet and, if you want to take part, you will be asked to sign a consent form. You can refuse or withdraw from a clinical trial without it affecting your care.\nRead further information:\n- Cancer Research UK: Melanoma research\nMany of the treatments described have unpleasant side effects that can affect your quality of life. You may decide against having treatment if it is unlikely to significantly extend your life expectancy, or if you do not have symptoms causing you pain or discomfort.\nThis is entirely your decision and your healthcare team will respect it. If you decide not to receive treatment, pain relief and nursing care will be made available when you need it. This is called palliative care.\nFurther information on advanced melanoma (stage 4)"

        "description": "Skin cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. Non-melanoma skin cancer refers to a group of cancers that slowly develop in the upper layers of the skin.\nThe term &#8216;non-melanoma&#8217; distinguishes these more common kinds of skin cancer from the less common skin cancer known as melanoma, which spreads faster in the body.\nThe first sign of non-melanoma skin cancer is usually the appearance of a lump or patch on the skin that doesn&#8217;t heal after a few weeks.\nIn most cases, cancerous lumps are red and firm, while cancerous patches are often flat and scaly.\nSpeak to your GP if you have any skin abnormality that hasn&#8217;t healed after 4 weeks. Although it is unlikely to be skin cancer, it is best to be sure.\nRead more about the symptoms of non-melanoma skin cancer\nNon-melanoma skin cancers usually develop in the outermost layer of skin (epidermis) and are often named after the type of skin cell from which they develop.\nThe 2 most common types of non-melanoma skin cancer are:\n- basal cell carcinoma – starts in the cells lining the bottom of the epidermis and accounts for about 75% of skin cancers\n- squamous cell carcinoma – starts in the cells lining the top of the epidermis and accounts for about 20% of skin cancers\nAlthough not classed as non-melanoma skin cancers, actinic keratoses&nbsp;and Bowen&#8217;s disease&nbsp;may sometimes develop into squamous cell carcinoma if left untreated.\nNon-melanoma skin cancer is mainly caused by overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. UV light comes from the sun, as well as artificial sunbeds and sunlamps.\nIn addition to UV light overexposure, there are certain things that can increase your chances of developing non-melanoma skin cancer, such as:\n- a family history of the condition\n- pale skin that burns easily\n- a large number of moles or freckles\nRead more about the causes of non-melanoma skin cancer\nNon-melanoma skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in the world. It affects slightly more men than women.\nYour GP can examine your skin for signs of skin cancer. They may refer you to a skin specialist (dermatologist) or a specialist plastic surgeon if they are unsure or suspect skin cancer.\nYour GP may refer you urgently, within 2 weeks, for squamous cell skin cancer. Basal cell skin cancers usually don&#8217;t need an urgent referral but you should still see a specialist within 18 weeks.\nThe specialist will examine your skin again and will perform a biopsy to confirm a diagnosis of skin cancer.\nA biopsy is an operation that removes some affected skin so it can be studied under a microscope.\nRead more about diagnosing non-melanoma skin cancer\nSurgery is the main treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer. This involves removing the cancerous tumour and some of the surrounding skin.\nOther treatments for non-melanoma skin cancer include cryotherapy, creams, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and a treatment known as photodynamic therapy (PDT).\nTreatment for non-melanoma skin cancer is generally successful as, unlike most other types of cancer, there is a considerably lower risk that the cancer will spread to other parts of the body.\nIt is estimated that basal cell carcinoma will spread to other parts of the body in less than 0.5% of cases. The risk is slightly higher in cases of squamous cell carcinoma, which spreads to other parts of the body in around 2 to 5% of cases.\nTreatment for&nbsp;non-melanoma skin cancer&nbsp;is completely successful in approximately 90% of cases.\nRead more about treating non-melanoma skin cancer\nIf you have had non-melanoma skin cancer in the past, there is a chance the condition may return. The chance of non-melanoma skin cancer returning is increased if your previous cancer was widespread and severe.\nIf your cancer team feels there is a significant risk of your non-melanoma skin cancer returning, you will probably require regular check-ups to monitor your health. You will also be shown how to examine your skin to check for tumours.\nNon-melanoma skin cancer is not always preventable, but you can reduce your chances of developing the condition by avoiding overexposure to UV light.\nYou can help protect yourself from&nbsp;sunburn by using sunscreen, dressing sensibly in the sun and limiting the time you spend in the sun during the hottest part of the day.\nSunbeds and sunlamps should also be avoided.\nRegularly checking your skin for signs of skin cancer can help lead to an early diagnosis and increase your chances of successful treatment.\nRead more about sunscreen and sun safety\nThe main symptom of non-melanoma skin cancer is the appearance of a lump or discoloured patch on the skin that doesn&#8217;t heal.\nThe lump or discoloured patch is the cancer, sometimes referred to as a tumour.\nNon-melanoma skin cancer most often appears on areas of skin which are regularly exposed to the sun, such as the face, ears, hands and&nbsp;shoulders.\nBasal cell carcinoma (BCC) usually&nbsp;appears as a small red or pink lump, although it can be pearly-white or &#8216;waxy&#8217; looking.&nbsp;It can also look like a red, scaly patch.\nThe lump slowly grows and may become crusty, bleed or develop into a painless ulcer.\nSquamous cell carcinoma (SCC) appears as a firm pink lump&nbsp;and may have&nbsp;a flat, scaly and crusted surface.\nThe lump is often tender to touch, bleeds easily and may develop into an ulcer.\nBowen&#8217;s disease is a very early form of skin cancer, sometimes referred to as &#8216;squamous cell carcinoma in situ&#8217;. It develops slowly and is easily&nbsp;treated.&nbsp;\nThe main sign is a red, scaly patch on the skin which may itch. It most commonly affects elderly women and is often found on the lower leg. However, it can appear on any area of the skin.\nIf you develop a lump, lesion or skin discolouration that hasn&#8217;t healed after 4 weeks, speak to your GP. While it is unlikely to be cancer, it is best to be sure.\nRead further information:\n- Cancer Research UK: Skin cancer symptoms\n- Macmillan Cancer Support: Signs and symptoms of skin cancer\nMost skin cancer is caused by ultraviolet (UV) light damaging the DNA in skin cells.

UVB is thought to be the main cause of non-melanoma skin cancer.\nArtificial sources of light, such as sunlamps and tanning beds, also increase your risk of developing skin cancer.\nRepeated sunburn, either by the sun or artificial sources of light, will make your skin more vulnerable to non-melanoma skin cancer.\nResearch suggests that if you have 2 or more close relatives who have had non-melanoma skin cancer, your chances of developing the condition may be increased.\nCertain factors are believed to increase your chances of developing all types of skin cancer, including:\n- pale skin that does not tan easily\n- red or blonde hair\n- blue eyes\n- older age\n- a large number of moles\n- a large number of freckles\n- an area of skin previously damaged by burning or radiotherapy treatment\n- a condition that suppresses your immune system, such as HIV\n- medicines that suppress your immune system (immunosuppressants), commonly used after organ transplants\n- exposure to certain chemicals, such as creosote and arsenic\n- a previous diagnosis of skin cancer\nRead further information:\n- Cancer Research UK: Risks and causes\n- Macmillan Cancer Support: Causes and risk factors of skin cancer\nA diagnosis of non-melanoma skin cancer will usually begin with a visit to your GP who will examine your skin and decide whether you need further assessment by a specialist.\nSome GPs take digital photographs of suspected tumours so they can email them to a specialist for assessment.\nIn 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of&nbsp;skin cancer&nbsp;and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected skin cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral.\nIf skin cancer is suspected, you may be referred to a skin specialist (dermatologist) or specialist plastic surgeon. The specialist should be able to confirm the diagnosis by carrying out a physical examination.\nHowever, they will probably also&nbsp;perform a biopsy – a surgical procedure where either a part or all of the tumour is removed and studied under a microscope. This is usually carried out under a local anaesthetic, meaning you will be awake, but the affected area will be numbed so you won&#8217;t feel pain.\nThis allows the dermatologist or plastic surgeon to determine what type of skin cancer you have and whether there is any chance the cancer could spread to other parts of your body.\nSometimes, skin cancer can be diagnosed and treated at the same time. In other words, the tumour can be removed and tested and you may not need further treatment because the cancer is unlikely to spread.\nIt may be several weeks before you receive the results of a biopsy.\nIf you have basal cell carcinoma (BCC), then you usually won&#8217;t require further tests, as the cancer is unlikely to spread.\nHowever, in rare cases of squamous cell carcinoma, further tests may be needed to make sure the cancer has not spread to another part of your body.\nThese tests may include a physical examination of your lymph nodes (glands found throughout your body). If cancer has spread, it may cause your glands to swell.\nIf the dermatologist or plastic surgeon thinks there is a high risk of the cancer spreading, it may be necessary to perform a biopsy on a lymph node. This is called a fine needle aspiration (FNA).\nDuring FNA, cells are removed using a needle and syringe so they can be examined. Finding cancerous cells in a nearby lymph node would suggest the squamous cell carcinoma has started to spread to other parts of your body.\nSurgery is the main treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer, although it may depend on your individual circumstances.\nOverall, treatment is successful for more than 90% of people with non-melanoma skin cancer.\nPeople with cancer should be cared for by a team of specialists that often includes a dermatologist, a plastic surgeon, an oncologist (a radiotherapy and chemotherapy specialist), a pathologist and a specialist nurse.\nIf you have non-melanoma skin cancer, you may see several (or all) of these professionals as part of your treatment.\nWhen deciding what treatment is best for you, your doctors will consider:\n- the type of cancer you have\n- the stage of your cancer (how big it is and how far it has spread)\n- your general health\nYour cancer team will recommend what they think is the best treatment option, but the final decision will be yours.\nBefore visiting hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions you would like to ask the specialist. For example, you may want to find out what the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments are.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has produced healthcare guidelines about NHS skin cancer services. These outline NICE’s main recommendations on how, over the coming years, people with skin cancer or melanoma should be treated.\nRead further information:\n- NICE: improving outcomes for people with skin tumours including melanoma\nSurgical excision is an&nbsp;operation to&nbsp;cut out the cancer along with surrounding healthy tissue to ensure the cancer is completely removed.\nIt may be done in combination with a skin graft, if&nbsp;it&#8217;s likely to leave significant scarring. A skin graft involves removing a patch of healthy skin, usually from a part of your body where any scarring cannot be seen, such as your back. It is then connected, or grafted, to the affected area.\nIn many cases, this operation is enough to cure skin cancer.\nCurettage and electrocautery is a similar technique to surgical excision, but is only suitable for cases where the cancer is quite small.\nThe surgeon will use a small, spoon-shaped blade to remove the cancer and an electric needle to remove the skin surrounding the wound. The procedure may need to be repeated two or three times to ensure the cancer is completely removed.\nCryotherapy uses cold treatment to destroy the cancer. It is sometimes used for non-melanoma skin cancers in their early stages. Liquid nitrogen is used to freeze the cancer, and this causes the area to scab over.\nAfter about a month, the scab containing the cancer will fall off your skin. Cryotherapy may leave a small white scar on your skin.\nMohs micrographic surgery (MMS) is used to treat non-melanoma skin cancers when:\n- it&#8217;s felt there is a high risk of the cancer spreading or returning\n- the cancer is in an area where it would be important to remove as little skin as possible, such as the nose or eyes\nIt involves removing the tumour bit by bit, as well as a small area of skin surrounding it. This minimises the removal of healthy tissue and reduces scarring.\nEach time a piece of tissue is removed, it is checked for cancer. The procedure may need to be repeated 2 or 3 times to ensure&nbsp;the cancer is completely removed.\nChemotherapy involves using medicines to kill cancerous cells. In the case of non-melanoma skin cancer, chemotherapy is only recommended when the tumour is contained within the top layer of the skin.\nThis type of chemotherapy involves applying a cream containing cancer-killing medicines to the affected area. As only the surface of the skin is affected, you will not experience the side effects associated with other forms of chemotherapy, such as vomiting or hair loss. However, your skin may feel sore for several weeks afterwards.\nPhotodynamic therapy (PDT) is used to treat basal cell carcinoma,&nbsp;Bowen&#8217;s disease and actinic keratoses. It involves using a cream which makes the skin highly sensitive to light.\nAfter the cream has been applied, a strong light source is shone onto the affected area of your skin, which kills the cancer. PDT may cause a burning sensation and around 2% of people who have this treatment will be left with some superficial scarring.\nImiquimod cream is a treatment for basal cell carcinoma with a diameter of less than 2cm (0.8 inches). It&#8217;s also used to treat actinic keratoses. Imiquimod encourages your immune system to attack the cancer in the skin.\nCommon side effects of imiquimod include redness, flaking or peeling skin&nbsp;and itchiness.\nLess common and more serious side effects of imiquimod include blistering or ulceration of your skin.\nWash the cream off and contact your GP if your skin blisters or you develop ulcers after using it.\nRadiotherapy involves using low doses of radiation to destroy the cancer. The level of radiation involved is perfectly safe. However, your skin may feel sore for a few weeks after radiotherapy.\nRadiotherapy is sometimes used to treat basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas if:\n- surgery would be unsuitable\n- the cancer covers a large area\n- the area is difficult to operate on\nRadiotherapy is sometimes used after surgical excision to try to prevent the cancer coming back. This is called adjuvant radiotherapy.\nElectrochemotherapy is a possible treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer. It may be considered if:\n- surgery isn&#8217;t suitable or hasn&#8217;t worked\n- radiotherapy and chemotherapy haven&#8217;t worked\nThe procedure involves giving chemotherapy intravenously (directly into a vein).&nbsp;Short, powerful pulses of electricity are then directed to the tumour using electrodes.\nThese electrical pulses allow the medicine to enter the tumour cells more effectively and cause more damage to the tumour. The procedure&nbsp;is usually&nbsp;carried out using general anaesthetic (where you&#8217;re asleep) but some people may&nbsp;be able to have&nbsp;local anaesthetic&nbsp;(where you&#8217;re awake but the area is numbed).\nDepending on how many tumours need to be treated, the procedure can take up to an hour to complete. The main side effect is some pain where the electrode was used, which can last for a few days and may require painkillers.\nIt usually takes around 6 weeks for results to appear&nbsp;and the procedure usually needs to be repeated.\nYour specialist can give you more detailed information about this treatment option.\nRead the NICE (2013) guidelines on Electrochemotherapy for metastases in the skin.\nRead further information:\n- Cancer Research UK: Treatment for skin cancer\n- Macmillan Cancer Support: Skin cancer"

        "description": "Slapped cheek syndrome (also called fifth disease or parvovirus B19) is a viral infection. It&#8217;s most common in children but it can affect people of any age. It usually causes a bright red rash on the cheeks.\nSlapped cheek syndrome is normally a mild infection that clears up by itself in 1 to 3 weeks. Once you’ve had the infection, you’re usually immune to it for life.\nHowever, slapped cheek syndrome can be more serious for some people. If you’re pregnant, have a blood disorder or a weakened immune system and have been exposed to the virus, you should get medical advice.\nSymptoms of slapped cheek syndrome usually develop 4 to 14 days after becoming infected. Sometimes, symptoms may not appear for up to 21 days.\nSome people with slapped cheek syndrome won’t notice any early symptoms, but most people will have the following symptoms for a few days:\n- a slightly high temperature (fever) of around 38°C (100.4°F)\n- a runny nose\n- a sore throat\n- a headache\n- an upset stomach\n- feeling generally unwell\nThe infection is most contagious during this initial period.\nAdults may also feel joint pain and stiffness. This may continue for several weeks or even months after the other symptoms have passed.\nAfter a few days, a distinctive bright red rash on both cheeks (‘slapped cheeks’) normally appears. Adults may not get this.\nBy the time this rash develops, the condition is no longer contagious.\nAfter another few days, a light pink rash may also appear on the chest, stomach, arms and thighs. This often has a raised, lace-like appearance and may be itchy.\nThe rashes will normally fade within a week or two. Occasionally, the body rash may come and go for a few weeks after the infection has passed. This can be triggered by exercise, heat, anxiety or stress.\nYou don’t usually need to see your GP if you think you or your child has slapped cheek syndrome as it normally gets better on its own.\nYou&rsquo;ve been exposed to anyone with slapped cheek syndrome or you have symptoms of the infection and:\nIf your GP is closed, phone 111.\nIn these cases, a blood test may be carried out to see if you’re immune to the infection. If you’re not immune, you’ll be monitored carefully to check for any problems.\nIf you develop severe anaemia, it’s likely that you’ll be sent to hospital for a blood transfusion.\nSlapped cheek syndrome is usually mild and should clear up without specific treatment.\nIf you or your child is feeling unwell, there are things you can do help ease the symptoms.\nUnless you or your child is feeling unwell, you do not have to stay away from work or school once the rash has developed. The infection is no longer contagious by this point.\nLet your child&#8217;s school know if your child has slapped cheek syndrome.\nSlapped cheek syndrome is caused by a virus called parvovirus B19. This is found in the droplets in the coughs and sneezes of someone with the infection.\nThe virus is spread in a similar way to colds and flu. You can become infected by:\n- inhaling droplets that are sneezed or coughed out by someone with the infection\n- touching a contaminated surface or object and then touching your mouth or nose\nSomeone with slapped cheek syndrome is infectious during the period before the rash develops. Once the rash appears, the condition can no longer be passed on.\nIt’s very difficult to prevent slapped cheek syndrome. This is because people who have the infection are most contagious before they develop any obvious symptoms.\nMake sure that everyone you live with washes their hands often to help stop the infection from spreading.\nThere’s currently no vaccine available to protect you against the condition."

For example:\n- leiomyosarcomas – which develop in muscle tissue\n- liposarcomas – which develop in fat tissue\n- angiosarcomas – which develop in the cells of the blood or lymph vessels\n- gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) – which can develop in&nbsp;the connective tissues that support the organs of the digestive system\nSoft tissue sarcomas account for around 1 in every 100 cancers diagnosed in the UK.\nCancer develops when cells multiply uncontrollably, forming tumours.&nbsp;\nIn the vast majority of soft tissue sarcomas it’s unclear what causes this to happen but there are a number of factors known to increase the risk, including:\n- age – soft tissue sarcomas can occur at any age, including in children, but they are more common in middle-aged or elderly people and your risk increases as you get older\n- certain genetic conditions – some genetic conditions, such as neurofibromatosis type 1 and retinoblastoma, are associated with an increased risk of soft tissue sarcomas\n- previous&nbsp;radiotherapy&nbsp;– some people who have previously had radiotherapy for another type of cancer develop a soft tissue sarcoma, often many years after their previous treatment\n- exposure to certain chemicals – exposure to some chemicals, including vinyl chloride, dioxins and phenoxyacetic herbicides, has been associated with increased rates of soft tissue sarcomas\nOne particular type of soft tissue sarcoma called&nbsp;Kaposi’s sarcoma&nbsp;– which develops in skin cells – is caused by a virus known as the human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8) infecting someone with a weakened immune system (such as people with&nbsp;HIV).\nAs soft tissue sarcomas can develop in most parts of the body, they can cause a wide range of symptoms.\nFor example, a tumour near the stomach may cause&nbsp;abdominal (tummy) pain, a feeling of fullness and&nbsp;constipation, whereas a tumour near the lungs may cause a&nbsp;cough&nbsp;or&nbsp;breathlessness.\nThere are often no obvious symptoms in the early stages of soft tissue sarcomas, although you may notice a soft, painless lump under your skin or deeper, that can’t easily be moved around and gets bigger over time.\nYou should speak to your GP if you have a worrying lump or any other troublesome symptoms. A lump the size of a golf ball or larger should be regarded as suspicious and needs to be investigated urgently.\nAlthough it is much more likely you have a benign (non-cancerous) condition, it is important to get your symptoms checked out.\nIf your GP feels there is a possibility you do have cancer, they will refer you for a number of hospital tests to confirm whether you have a soft tissue sarcoma.\nIn 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of&nbsp;soft tissue sarcoma&nbsp;and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected soft tissue sarcoma, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on&nbsp;Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral.\nA diagnosis of a soft tissue sarcoma will usually be made by a hospital specialist and will be based on your symptoms, a physical examination, and the results of:\n- a&nbsp;biopsy&nbsp;– where a sample of suspected cancerous tissue is removed using a needle or during an operation so it can be tested and analysed in a laboratory\n- imaging tests – a&nbsp;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan&nbsp;is the main type of scan carried out to assess soft tissue sarcomas, although other scans may also be carried out\nIf a diagnosis of a soft tissue sarcoma is confirmed, these tests will also help determine how far the cancer has spread (known as the ‘stage’) and how aggressive the cancer is (known as the ‘grade’).\nIf you’re diagnosed with a soft tissue sarcoma your care team of specialist doctors and nurses will help you decide on the most appropriate treatment.\nTreatment depends on factors such as the stage and grade of the cancer, the location of any tumours, and your age and general health.\nThe main treatments used are:\n- surgery – to remove any tumours\n- radiotherapy – where high-energy radiation is used to kill cancer cells\n- chemotherapy&nbsp;– where medication is used to kill cancer cells\nSurgery is the main treatment for soft tissue sarcomas that are detected at an early stage.\nIt involves removing the cancerous tumour along with a section of surrounding healthy tissue. This will help ensure no cancer cells are left behind.\nEvery effort will be made to reduce the impact of surgery on the appearance and functionality of the affected body part.\nBut there is a possibility you’ll have some difficulty using the part of the body that is operated on after surgery and sometimes reconstructive plastic surgery may be needed to repair significant damage.\nIn a small number of cases, there may be no option but to&nbsp;amputate&nbsp;the part of the body where the cancer is located, such as part of the leg.\nRadiotherapy is often used after surgery to destroy any remaining cancer cells. This is carried out using an external machine that directs beams of radiation at a defined treatment area.\nRadiotherapy may also sometimes be used before surgery to make a tumour easier to remove, or as part of your treatment to reduce your symptoms if surgery is not possible.\nCommon side effects of radiotherapy include sore skin, tiredness and&nbsp;hair loss&nbsp;in the treatment area. These tend to get better within a few days or weeks of treatment finishing.\nRead more about the&nbsp;side effects of radiotherapy\nLike radiotherapy, chemotherapy is sometimes used before surgery to shrink a tumour and make it easier to remove. This involves being given anti-cancer medication directly into a vein (intravenously).\nChemotherapy may also be used alone or alongside radiotherapy for soft tissue sarcomas that cannot be surgically removed.\nChemotherapy medications have a poisonous effect on the body’s cells, and can cause a number of temporary but unpleasant side effects, such as feeling tired and weak all the time, feeling and being sick, and hair loss from several parts of the body.\nRead more about the&nbsp;side effects of chemotherapy\nAs with most types of cancer, the outlook for a soft tissues sarcoma depends largely on how far the cancer has advanced when it is diagnosed.\nIf the cancer is detected at an early stage and can be removed during surgery, there is a possibility it can be cured.\nBut you’ll need regular check-ups following treatment to check for any signs the cancer has come back. You may also need long-term physiotherapy and&nbsp;occupational therapy&nbsp;to help you manage any physical difficulties resulting from surgery.\nA&nbsp;cure is not usually possible if a soft tissue sarcoma is only detected at a late stage when it has already spread to other parts of the body, although treatment can help slow the spread of the cancer and control your symptoms.\nRead further information soft tissue sarcomas"

        "disease": "Soft tissue sarcomas: Teenagers and young adults",
        "description": "This section is for teenagers and young adults. It’s about a type of cancer called soft tissue sarcoma.\nThere are several different types of soft tissue sarcoma. The information in this section covers rhabdomyosarcomas, synovial sarcomas, soft tissue Ewing’s sarcoma and fibrosarcomas. These are the most common types in teenagers. If you have a different type and want to know more, contact Macmillan Cancer Support.\nIf you&#8217;re looking for information about soft tissue sarcomas in people of all ages, read our general&nbsp;soft tissue sarcoma section.\nSoft tissue sarcomas are cancers that develop from cells in the soft, supporting tissues of the body. There are many different types, but the ones that tend to affect teenagers are:\n- rhabdomyosarcomas\n- synovial sarcomas\n- soft tissue Ewing’s sarcoma\n- fibrosarcomas\nSarcomas can also develop in the bones. This is called osteosarcoma.&nbsp;\nThe symptoms of a sarcoma will depend on where it is:\n- if it’s in an arm or leg, symptoms include a lump or swelling in the limb – this is usually painless, but not always\n- if it’s in the tummy (abdomen), symptoms include a painful, swollen tummy, and problems going to the toilet to poo (called constipation)\n- if it’s in your bladder, symptoms include pain in the lower tummy, finding it difficult to pee (pass urine), and having blood in your pee\n- if it’s in the chest, symptoms can include breathlessness, a cough and pain in your chest\n- if it’s in the head or neck, symptoms include a lump, a blockage and discharge from the nose or throat;&nbsp;occasionally an eye may become swollen and stick out a bit\nYou may also have other symptoms, such as tiredness, loss of appetite or weight loss.\nRemember – most people with these symptoms won’t have a sarcoma. &nbsp;But if you have any of these symptoms, or are worried that you may have a sarcoma, the first thing to do is to speak to your GP. They&#8217;ll examine you and refer you to a hospital if they think you need to see a specialist doctor.\nIt&#8217;s unknown what causes sarcomas in teenagers and young adults.\nPeople often think a knock or injury might have caused a sarcoma, but there’s no evidence for this.\nRemember that nothing you’ve done has caused the cancer.\nThis type of sarcoma grows in the active muscles of the body. These are muscles that we have control over, like the muscles we use to move our arms or legs. Rhabdomyosarcomas are most likely to happen in the head, neck, bladder, vagina, arms, legs and trunk.&nbsp;\nThere are different types or rhabdomyosarcoma. The most likely one to happen in teenagers and young adults is called an alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma and affects an arm or a leg.&nbsp;\nThis type of sarcoma is most likely to happen in the tissue around the joints, like your elbow, knee and ankle. It can also happen in other parts of your body, but that is less common. This type of sarcoma might not be obvious straight away because the lump grows slowly and is usually not sore.&nbsp;\nIf you have a type of soft tissue sarcoma called a soft tissue Ewing&#8217;s sarcoma, it&#8217;s treated in the same way as a Ewing’s sarcoma in a bone.\nFurther information on bone cancer\nThis type of sarcoma happens in the fibrous tissue in your body. Fibrous tissue joins the structures inside your body together – like your muscles to bones. You’re most likely to find a fibrosarcoma on your arms, legs or trunk, but they can happen deeper in your body.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\nIf you&#8217;re looking for information about soft tissue sarcomas in people of all ages, read our general&nbsp;soft tissue sarcoma information.\nThe soft tissues of the body connect, surround and support other body tissue and organs. Soft tissue includes muscle, cartilage, fat, fibrous tissue, nerves and blood vessels.\nSoft tissue sarcomas are cancers that develop from cells in the soft, supporting tissues of the body.\nThere are many different types, but the ones that tend to affect teenagers are:&nbsp;\n- rhabdomyosarcomas&nbsp;\n- synovial sarcomas&nbsp;\n- fibrosarcomas\nThere are also bone sarcomas.\nDoctors can tell the type of soft tissue sarcoma by closely examining the sample of tissue that’s been removed (called a biopsy) under a microscope.\nThese develop from muscle and the surrounding tissue. There are 2 main types that affect younger people:\n- alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas&nbsp;– these are more common in teenagers and young adults and are usually found in an arm or leg (limb), or in the muscles of the chest or tummy (abdomen)\n- embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas – these are more common in children and can start in a number of areas, for example, around the eye, where the throat joins with the nose, the bladder, the womb, or the vagina\nThese usually develop near to but not inside joints, such as the knee or elbow. But they can develop anywhere in the body. They usually appear as hard lumps.\nThese start in cells called fibrocytes, which form the tissue that helps join parts of our body together, such as joining the muscles to the bones. Fibrosarcomas are usually found in the arms, legs or torso, but can also start in areas deeper in the body.\nThe information in this section covers the common types of soft tissue sarcoma, but if you have a different one and want to know more, please contact Macmillan Cancer Support.\nIt&#8217;s unknown&nbsp;what causes sarcomas in teenagers and young adults.\nRemember that nothing you’ve done has caused the cancer.&nbsp;\nSome rare conditions that run in families (known as genetic conditions) can increase the chance (risk) of getting a soft tissue sarcoma. You would usually know if anyone in your family had one of these conditions.\nPeople who had radiotherapy for another type of cancer when they were a child may have an increased risk of developing a sarcoma in later life – this would be from their teens onwards.&nbsp;\nPeople often think a knock or injury might have caused a sarcoma, but there’s no evidence for this.\nIf you&#8217;re looking for information about soft tissue sarcomas in people of all ages, read our general&nbsp;soft tissue sarcoma information.\nThere are some tests you might have at your GP surgery or at the hospital. These tests will help the doctors see whether you have a soft tissue sarcoma.\nIf you think you might have some of the symptoms of a soft tissue sarcoma, you should go to your GP. They&#8217;ll be able to talk to you about your symptoms, and they can arrange tests to find out more.\nThey’ll examine you and usually arrange for some tests, such as X-rays. There may be a number of reasons why you&#8217;re feeling unwell, so it can be difficult to diagnose the problem straight away. If your GP can&#8217;t find the cause, you&#8217;ll be referred to a specialist at the hospital.\nTo begin with, you may see a specialist at a general hospital for more tests. If your GP suspects you have a soft tissue sarcoma, they may refer you directly to a sarcoma specialist.\nIf you&#8217;re diagnosed with a sarcoma and you’re not already seeing a specialist, you’ll be referred to one. You&#8217;ll probably see a lot of doctors, nurses and other staff.\nYour hospital doctor will examine you and arrange for some of the&nbsp;following tests, which Macmillan have information on:\n- X-rays\n- bone scans\n- ultrasound scans\n- MRI, CT or PET scans\n- biopsies\n- bone marrow tests\nYou won&#8217;t necessarily need all of these tests.\nIf the tests show that you have a sarcoma, you might need a few more tests to check how your body is working in general. Macmillan have information on these, including:\n- blood tests\n- tests to check your heart is healthy, including an echocardiogram or&nbsp;electrocardiogram (ECG), or a nuclear medicine scan (MUGA scan)\n- tests to check your kidneys are healthy, which can involve blood tests or having your wee (urine) collected for a period of time or a nuclear medicine blood test (GFR)\nThis may seem like a lot of tests, but they’ll help the doctors plan the best treatment for you.\nHaving tests and waiting for the results can be a scary time. Talking about how you feel and getting support from family, friends and your specialist nurse and doctor can make it a bit easier.\nIf you&#8217;re looking for information about soft tissue sarcomas in people of all ages, read our general&nbsp;soft tissue sarcoma information.\nThis section is for teenagers and young adults. It’s about treatment for a type of cancer called a soft tissue sarcoma. There are different types of soft tissue sarcoma, and the information in this section covers rhabdomyosarcomas, synovial sarcomas and fibrosarcomas, which are the most common types in teenagers.\nIf you have a different type and want to know more, contact Macmillan Cancer Support.\nThe 3 main types of treatment for soft tissue sarcomas are surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.\nMost people have a combination of treatments. Your doctors will plan your treatment based on:\n- the&nbsp;type of sarcoma you have\n- the stage of the cancer (how big it is and whether it has spread from where it started)\n- the grade of the cancer (how fast-growing the cancer cells are).\nIf you have any questions about your treatment, ask your doctor or nurse. They’ll be happy to help you understand what&#8217;s involved.\nIf you have a type of soft tissue sarcoma called a soft tissue Ewing&#8217;s sarcoma, it&#8217;s treated in the same way as a Ewing’s sarcoma in a bone.\nThis is when you&#8217;re given anti-cancer drugs to destroy the cancer cells. For soft tissue sarcomas, chemotherapy can be given in a number of situations:\n- before surgery – to shrink the tumour\n- after surgery – to reduce the risk of the cancer coming back, and to treat cancer cells that have spread\n- when it isn’t possible to remove the sarcoma with an operation\nFor soft tissue sarcomas, chemotherapy&nbsp;is given into a vein, usually through a central line, a port or a PICC line. You can find out more about&nbsp;chemotherapy&nbsp;and how it&#8217;s given.\nYou’ll have chemotherapy&nbsp;over a few days, then you’ll have a few weeks off so that your body can recover from any side effects. The days you have the chemotherapy&nbsp;and the rest period afterwards are called a cycle. Most people have several cycles of chemotherapy.\nYou&#8217;ll probably need to stay in hospital for some of the time during chemotherapy, but it’s often possible to have part of your treatment as an outpatient.\nDifferent chemotherapy drugs are used for soft tissue sarcomas, and you’ll usually have 2 or 3 drugs in combination. This is sometimes called a regimen or treatment plan. Your doctor will decide which regimen or treatment plan is best for you depending on the grade and stage of your sarcoma. You may have chemotherapy treatment as part of a clinical research trial. It will be your decision whether or not you take part in a trial. Your doctor will explain it fully before you make the choice if there is a trial that is right for you.\nSome of the main chemotherapy drugs for soft tissue sarcomas are:\n- ifosfamide\n- vincristine\n- actinomycin D\n- doxorubicin\n- cyclophosphamide\n- cisplatin\nIf you have a rhabdomyosarcoma, you may be given ifosfamide, vincristine and actinomycin. Giving these drugs together is called IVA.\nYou might also be given ifosfamide, vincristine actinomycin and doxorubicin. Giving these drugs together is called IVADO.\nMacmillan Cancer Support have further information on cancer treatments and drugs.\nOther types of soft tissue sarcoma can be treated with different combinations of drugs, such as ifosfamide and doxorubicin, or vinorelbine and cyclophosphamide. Your cancer doctor and specialist nurse will explain more about the type of chemotherapy you’re going to have and how many cycles you’ll need.\nDifferent chemotherapy&nbsp;drugs cause different side effects. Some people have just a few side effects and others have more. It&#8217;s hard to know how it&#8217;s going to be for you, as everyone is different. The most common are hair loss, tiredness, sickness and being more at risk of getting an infection.\nSide effects can often be controlled, so always let your doctor or nurse know about the side effects you’re having. They can usually do something to improve them. Most side effects are short-term (temporary) and gradually disappear once treatment stops.\nFurther information on chemotherapy for soft tissue sarcoma\nSurgery to remove the cancer is one of the main treatments for soft tissue sarcomas. Your surgeon will aim to remove all of the cancer, and at the same time reduce any long-term effects as much as possible.\nThe operation you have will depend on the size of the sarcoma and where it is in your body. You might meet other people with the same type of sarcoma who have had a different operation. Everyone is different. Your cancer doctor and specialist nurse will talk to you about your operation and make sure you understand why you need to have it and what&#8217;s involved. Below are some of the different types of operation you might have for a soft tissue sarcoma.\nWe also have more information about what will happen before and after the operation in our surgery section.\nYou may have an operation called a wide local excision to remove the cancer and an area of tissue surrounding it (called the margin). This tissue is checked to make sure it doesn’t contain any cancer cells. Sometimes the surgeon also removes some of the lymph nodes (glands) near the cancer to find out if there are any cancer cells there. If there are cancer cells in the margin or lymph nodes, some people may need to have more surgery.\nIf you need to have a large area of tissue removed, you may need to have a skin graft or soft tissue graft. This is when skin and sometimes muscle is taken from a different part of the body to place over the area where the sarcoma was removed from. This is called plastic surgery or reconstructive surgery. It’s done to give you as natural an appearance as possible and to make sure you can still do the things you did before your operation. Both operation sites will gradually heal over a few weeks after the operation.\nIf the sarcoma is in an arm or leg you may have limb-sparing surgery. This means the surgeon takes away the cancer without removing the arm or leg. You’ll have all of the tumour taken away from your limb, as well as any bone and muscle affected by the tumour.\nThe surgeon then replaces what they’ve taken away. This may involve using plastic surgery or reconstructive surgery (see skin graft or soft tissue graft) to replace the tissue that’s been removed, or it may involve surgery to replace any bone that’s been removed. If you need to have bone removed, the surgeon replaces it with a specially designed metal implant called an endoprosthesis.\nIf the cancer affects a bone in or near a joint, your joint can be replaced with an artificial one.\nYour physiotherapist might give you exercises before your operation to strengthen your muscles.\nIf you&#8217;ve had chemotherapy, you&#8217;ll need 2 or 3 weeks to recover from the treatment before you can have your operation. Doctors will check that your blood count has returned to normal. They&#8217;ll also make sure that you&#8217;re well enough to have the operation. If you’ve lost weight or been off your food, you might need to build yourself up a bit. The hospital dietitian can help you do this. You’ll probably also see a physiotherapist, who’ll give you exercises to do to strengthen your muscles.\nIf you want to have a look at the endoprosthesis that will be put in during your surgery, your nurse or surgeon can usually arrange this.\nYou’ll have a bandage or splint on your limb to keep it still and let it heal.\nYou’ll probably have a tube, called a drain, coming out of your wound. This stops fluid building up in your wound. A nurse will take it out after about 3 to 4 days or when there isn’t very much fluid coming out of the wound.\nYou won’t feel like eating or drinking much for a few hours after your operation, so you’ll be given fluids into a vein.\nYou’ll probably feel a bit sore to begin with, but you’ll be given strong painkillers to help. It’s important to tell the nurses if you need extra pain relief. The pain usually starts to get better within 2&nbsp;to 3 days. As time goes on you&#8217;ll need fewer painkillers and will start to feel a lot more comfortable. Be honest about how you are feeling to your doctors and nurses and they can make sure that you are comfortable and as pain-free as possible.\nOnce you’re home you’ll probably feel a bit better and stronger every day. But if you do have any problems it’s important to get them treated right away, as a delay could mean they get much more serious.\nIf your new joint starts to stiffen up you may need some more physiotherapy, so tell your doctor so they can arrange this for you.\nIf you notice any new redness, soreness or swelling in the limb that’s been operated on, it’s really important to get in touch with your doctor right away. You might have an infection that needs treatment, so you’ll need to see the surgeon who did your operation without delay.\nThere’s more information about the long-term effects of limb-sparing surgery in our section on living with and after a soft tissue sarcoma.\nVery occasionally the only way to get rid of the cancer is to remove the limb where the sarcoma is growing. This is called an amputation and it’s only ever done if there is no alternative.\nYour doctor will talk things through with you so that you fully understand what’s involved. Losing a limb can feel very scary and you might want to talk to a specialist nurse or a counsellor about your feelings. It might also help to talk to someone who has had an amputation &#8211; your nurse or doctor can arrange this. It&#8217;s really important to get support.\nYou’ll have bandages or a plaster cast on the area that’s been operated on. There’ll be a drain coming from the wound to remove any excess fluid that builds up. The drain is usually taken out by a nurse on the ward after 3 to 4 days or when there is no fluid coming from the wound. You’ll also be given fluid into a vein in your arm until you feel like eating and drinking again.\nYou’ll probably feel a bit sore after your operation, especially for the first 2 to 4 days, but you&#8217;ll be given strong painkillers to help with this. It’s important to tell the doctors and nurses if you need extra pain relief. You may have pain that feels as if it’s coming from the part of the limb that’s been removed. This is known as phantom pain. Let your doctor or nurse know if you have this. There are medicines that can help ease it or take it away. It usually gets better and goes away in time.\nA physiotherapist will visit you a day or so after your operation. They’ll show you exercises to keep your muscles strong and flexible.\nIf you’ve had an arm removed, you’ll be able to get up and move around once you’ve recovered from the anaesthetic and don’t feel too sore. If you’ve had a leg removed, the physiotherapist will show you how to move around in bed and get from your bed to a chair. You&#8217;ll probably be moving around with crutches or in a wheelchair within a few days.\nOnce you’re up and around you’ll go to the hospital gym for physiotherapy. This is a big part of your recovery. Your physiotherapist will give you more exercises to do as your wound heals and you get stronger.\nIt’ll take a few months for your limb to heal to its final shape after the operation, so you won’t be fitted with your permanent prosthesis (artificial limb) until this happens. In the meantime, you’ll be given a temporary prosthesis and you’ll start learning how to use it in physiotherapy. A specialist team will help you recover from the operation and get you used to the artificial limb that you’re fitted with.\nYou&#8217;ll be able to go home about two weeks after your operation.\nYou can read more about recovering after the operation in our information about living with and after a soft tissue sarcoma.&nbsp;\nRemember that it may be possible to talk to someone who has been through the same as you. Your doctor or nurse can arrange this.&nbsp; &nbsp;\nRadiotherapy treats cancer by using high-energy X-rays to destroy cancer cells while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. There’s more information about it in the&nbsp;radiotherapy section.\nFor soft tissue sarcomas radiotherapy can be given in a number of situations:\n- after surgery – to reduce the risk of the cancer coming back in the same area, or to get rid of any cancer cells that may be left behind; you’ll usually have it about 4 to 6 weeks after the operation, when your wound has healed\n- before surgery – to shrink the tumour and make it easier to remove with an operation\n- when it isn’t possible to remove the sarcoma with an operation\nRadiotherapy is generally given every weekday (Monday to Friday). Each treatment takes a few minutes.\nRadiotherapy isn&#8217;t painful, but it can cause some side effects. After a few treatments you may begin to feel tired, and your skin may go red or get darker and feel sore or itchy around the area that’s being treated. This gets better once your radiotherapy treatment is over.\nOther side effects depend on which part of your body is being treated. Having radiotherapy around a joint can make it feel stiff, but physiotherapy can help.\nIf you&#8217;re looking for information about soft tissue sarcomas in people of all ages, read our general&nbsp;soft tissue sarcoma information.\nThis information is about life after having surgery for a soft tissue sarcoma. You may find it useful to read the information about surgery first.\nThe long-term effects of limb-sparing surgery depend on which part of your body is affected and what kind of operation you have. The best person to ask about your operation is your surgeon.\nAfter limb-sparing surgery the limb might not work as well as it used to. Physiotherapy is an important part of your recovery. You’ll be given exercises to do to help you get your limb working as well as possible. These can be hard work, but it’s important to keep going with them.\nIf you’ve had a joint replacement, you’ll be able to walk and swim and do most of the things you could do before, but your doctor might advise you not to play high-impact sports like hockey, football, tennis or rugby. These activities could damage or loosen the new joint. Check with your surgeon about any special instructions they may have for what activities you can do.\n&nbsp;If you’ve had a shoulder replacement you might find it harder to lift your arm above your shoulder. After any kind of joint replacement, you will be given physiotherapy. It’s very important to do the exercises your physiotherapist shows you so that you get as much movement back as possible.\nAfter amputation most people have an artificial limb, called a prosthesis. There are artificial limbs designed to let you do all types of physical activities, including walking, swimming, running, cycling and playing sports.\nDifferent types of prosthesis let you do different things. Some people have one for wearing day-to-day, and an extra one specially designed for something like swimming or doing athletics.\nYou might feel lots of different emotions. You might be tearful, angry, fed up or depressed at times. You might think you&#8217;ve lost all your confidence and that you&#8217;ll never be able to live a normal life or be in a relationship. These feelings are normal, and it&#8217;s important that you get support to help you cope with them. You could talk to:\n- family or friends\n- a counsellor – this can be arranged by your doctor or nurse\n- other young people in a similar situation\nThings will be tough as you get used to living with an amputation, but help is available.\nOther people&#8217;s reactions can be hard to cope with, too. You might be worried about what your friends think or how they&#8217;re going to treat you. The thought of going back to school, college or work can be scary. Even people in your family who you are close to might not know what to say or do. Others might say things that sound stupid or seem hurtful.\nTry to choose a couple of really close relatives or friends you can call on when things get you down. You might also find it useful to talk to someone outside your close circle, like a counsellor. Most people find it helps to talk about how they&#8217;re feeling or what’s on their mind.\nIf you&#8217;re looking for information about soft tissue sarcomas in people of all ages, read our general&nbsp;soft tissue sarcoma information."

This is because your sore throat may be a symptom of a more serious condition.&nbsp;\nThe cause of a sore throat isn&#8217;t always obvious. But in most cases it&#8217;s a symptom of a viral or bacterial infection.\nA sore throat is often a symptom of:&nbsp;\n- colds or flu – you may also have a blocked or runny nose, a cough, a high temperature (fever), a headache&nbsp;and general aches&nbsp;\n- laryngitis&nbsp;(inflammation of the voice box) – you may also have a hoarse voice, a dry cough and a constant need to clear your throat\n- tonsillitis&nbsp;(inflammation of the tonsils) – you may also have red or spotty tonsils, discomfort when swallowing and a fever&nbsp;&nbsp;\n- strep throat (a bacterial throat infection) – you may also have swollen glands in your neck, discomfort when swallowing and tonsillitis\n- glandular fever – you may also feel very tired, have a fever and swollen glands in your neck&nbsp;\nIt may also be caused by something irritating your throat. For example, smoke, gastro-oesophageal&nbsp;reflux disease (where acid leaks up from the stomach) and allergies.&nbsp;\nLess often, a sore throat can be a sign of:\n- a painful collection of pus at the back of the throat (quinsy) – the pain may be severe and you may also have difficulty opening your mouth or difficulty swallowing\n- inflammation of the flap of tissue at the back of the throat (epiglottitis) – the pain may be severe and you may have difficulty breathing and difficulty swallowing\nThese conditions are more serious and should be seen by a doctor as soon as possible."

        "disease": "Spina bifida",
        "description": "Spina bifida is when a baby&#8217;s spinal column and spinal cord doesn&#8217;t form properly in the womb. This causes a gap or split in the spine. This causes damage to the central nervous system.\nSpina bifida is a type of neural tube defect. The neural tube is the name for the cells that become the spinal cord when a baby is growing in the womb. These cells start out flat, then roll up and close into a tube as a baby develops. If this tube does not close completely, the backbone that protects the spinal cord does not form as it should. This often results in damage to the spinal cord and nerves. This can happen anywhere along the spine.\nThere are 2 types of spina bifida.\nOpen spinal defect is the most severe type of spina bifida. It means that the baby&#8217;s spinal cord and protective membranes are outside the spinal canal, in the open. Often, there&#8217;s also spinal fluid leakage around the defect.\nThis must be closed very soon after birth.\nClosed spinal defect is less severe. It usually causes mild or no neurological symptoms. The baby may need surgical intervention later in life.\nSpina bifida can cause symptoms like:\n- weakness or complete loss of movement of lower limbs\n- sensation changes in the legs and/or torso\n- curvature of the spine due to muscle weakness (scoliosis)\n- urinary incontinence\n- urinary retention\n- repeat or frequent urinary tract infections\n- kidney problems\n- bowel incontinence, leading to constipation and/or diarrhoea\n- hydrocephalus (excess fluid on the brain)\n- skin problems\n- latex allergy\nIt&#8217;s not known exactly what causes spina bifida. But, there are some things that can increase the risk of a baby developing the condition.\nNot having enough folic acid during pregnancy can increase the chances of a child having spina bifida.\nFolic acid (also known as vitamin B9) is found in foods like peas, broccoli and spinach. Its added to food like some breakfast cereals.\nTaking folic acid supplements can reduce the risk of spina bifida in unborn babies. Folic acid tablets are available from pharmacies and supermarkets. A GP may also be able to prescribe them for you.\nRead more about why you need folic acid during pregnancy\nIf you&#8217;ve a family member with spina bifida, you might be more likely to have a baby with the condition.\nIf you&#8217;ve had a child with spina bifida, the chance that you&#8217;ll have another child with the same condition increases.\nIf you&#8217;ve a family history of spina bifida, your GP will likely prescribe a higher dose of folic acid for you to take. Ideally, you should take this:\n- before you become pregnant\n- for at least the first 12 weeks of pregnancy\nThere are some medicines that are linked to an increased risk of having a baby with spina bifida. These are medicines like valproate and carbamazepine (used to treat epilepsy).\nIf you&#8217;ve any concerns that your medication may increase the risk of spina bifida, you should speak to your GP:\n- before becoming pregnant\n- as soon as possible if your pregnancy is unplanned\nDo not stop taking any medicine that&rsquo;s been prescribed without checking with your GP or healthcare professional first. You could make yourself very ill.\nSpina bifida might be detected during the mid pregnancy scan. This usually takes place between 18 and 21 weeks of pregnancy.\nSometimes, spina bifida may not be diagnosed until after the baby is born.\nThe treatment of spina bifida will depend on what type you or your child has.\nIf your child is diagnosed with a closed spinal defect, a neurosurgeon will discuss management with you. Your child may not need surgery.\nIf an open spinal defect has been diagnosed before birth, you may be offered prenatal surgery (when a surgeon operates on your baby before you&#8217;ve given birth). This surgery will close or cover a spina bifida lesion. The benefits and risks of surgery will be discussed with you during pre-natal counselling.\nRead more about prenatal surgery for spina bifida\nIf your child is not diagnosed until after birth, or prenatal surgery hasn&#8217;t taken place, they&#8217;ll be referred to a specialist team.\nYour child will see a paediatric neurosurgeon shortly after birth. The surgeon will assess the defect, and will discuss the surgery with you.\nIf they need surgery, it&#8217;ll probably take place in a specialist unit within 48 to 72 hours.\nDuring surgery the surgeon will put the spinal cord and any exposed tissues or nerves back into the correct place. They&#8217;ll close the gap in the spine and seal the hole with muscle and skin. Occasionally, plastic surgeons may be involved if the defect is large.\nAlthough surgery will close the gap, it will not be able to restore any function your child has already lost.\nIf your child has already developed hydrocephalus, the surgeon may:\n- place a shunt at the same time as their spina bifida surgery\n- suggest a watch and wait approach\nRead more about hydrocephalus\nPeople with spina bifida can live full lives, but may need help managing their condition.\nThe help you need will vary depending on how your spina bifida affects you or your child.\nTargeted physiotherapy can help improve and maintain posture, coordination, strength and balance.\nThe physiotherapist may teach you physical exercises you can do. These will aim to strengthen and stretch your muscles.\nIf needed, a physiotherapist will also recommend walking aids to help you get around.\nOccupational therapists help people to complete everyday tasks. They do this by finding new ways that you or your child can complete them. They can also help you break down activities into smaller movements, building confidence.\nOccupational therapists also have good knowledge of the medical aids and technologies available. They&#8217;ll be able to suggest the ones that can help you or your child.\nMore about occupational therapy\nYou might need a wheelchair if you&#8217;re unable to use your legs at all.\nOther mobility aids that can help you or your child include leg braces and splints.\nIf you or your child has problems with bone development (like a club foot) you&#8217;ll be seen by an orthopaedic team. They&#8217;ll suggest how these conditions should be managed. They may recommend surgery.\nSome people with spina bifida have problems controlling their bladder.\nTreatment for bladder problems might include:\n- medicines to help relax the bladder to reduce the urge to pee too often\n- antibiotics to help prevent urinary and kidney infections\n- urinary catheterisation to help prevent infection\n- bladder surgery to make the bladder bigger so it can hold more urine (pee), or to make an opening in the belly for a catheter\nIf you or your child has bladder problems that need surgery, you&#8217;ll be seen by general surgeons.\nRead more about urinary incontinence\nBowel problems, like constipation, can be a problem for people with spina bifida.\nTreatment for bowel problems might include:\n- laxatives &#8211; a type of medication to help empty the bowels\n- suppositories and enemas &#8211; medicines put into the bottom to help relieve constipation\n- anal irrigation &#8211; specialist equipment that pumps water through a tube in your bottom to empty the bowel\n- antegrade continence enema (ACE) &#8211; surgery that links the bowel and a small opening (stoma) on the surface of the abdomen (tummy)\n- colostomy &#8211; surgery that connects one end of the large bowel through an opening in the tummy so waste can be collected in a pouch\nIf you or your child has bowel problems that need surgery, you&#8217;ll be seen by general surgeons.\nAfter surgery, you or your child are likely to have a lot of follow up appointments. This may be with the surgeon who did the surgery. You may also have appointments at specific spina bifida clinics. There, you&#8217;ll see different specialists, including:\n- neurologists\n- neurosurgeons\n- general surgeons\n- orthopaedic surgeons\n- physiotherapists\n- specialist nurses\n- urologists\n- psychologists\n- occupational therapists\n- orthotists"

        "disease": "Spinal stenosis",
        "description": "This information may be useful for people who have been diagnosed with spinal stenosis. This includes cervical stenosis and lumbar stenosis. People who are experiencing new or ongoing symptoms should contact their healthcare professional.\nRead about managing a back problem\nRead about managing a neck problem\nSpinal stenosis is narrowing of the tunnels in the spine which contain the nerves or spinal cord. It&#8217;s a common condition. Most narrowing is a normal part of the ageing process and often does not cause problems.\nIn some cases spinal stenosis can lead to irritation or compression of the nerves. Spinal stenosis can affect any part of the spine but is most common in the lower back (lumbar stenosis) and neck (cervical stenosis). This can lead to pain in the lower back and legs, or in the neck, arms and hands.\nAlthough stenosis can cause pain, the nerves can learn to adapt to the narrowed space. The majority of people with this condition can manage their symptoms well, with the right advice and information.\nIn some cases further help is necessary, particularly if symptoms are impacting your arm or leg function, walking or quality of life.\nSymptoms of spinal stenosis can vary. Many people experience no symptoms at all. Though uncommon, some people can experience both lumbar and cervical stenosis at the same time.\nLumbar spine stenosis symptoms affect the legs and may include:\n- pain\n- aching\n- cramping\n- heaviness and or weakness\n- tingling\n- pins and needles\n- numbness\nThese symptoms are usually worse with walking or standing, and are relieved by sitting or leaning forward.\nCervical spine stenosis symptoms affect the arms and may include:\n- pain\n- stiffness\n- weakness\n- tingling\n- pins and needles\n- numbness\nYou may also experience headaches.\nPatients with spinal stenosis can also have back or neck pain. However in the absence of leg or arm symptoms, low back or neck pain are usually not thought to be caused by stenosis.\nSpinal stenosis is a long term condition, and symptoms can vary. Many patients find that managing their symptoms can help improve their quality of life.\nAny progression of symptoms is usually slow. This allows time for symptoms to be monitored and for treatments to be considered.\nSpinal stenosis can be diagnosed following an assessment from a healthcare professional. They will ask questions about your symptoms and carry out a physical examination.\nIn some cases, further examinations may be advised to rule out other serious health conditions. For people with severe and worsening symptoms, scans may be considered to help decide if spinal surgery may be helpful.\nAs we get older, ageing in the spine can cause tunnel narrowing and a reduction of space around the spinal cord or nerves. Other causes include:\n- injury\n- rheumatoid arthritis\n- certain bone diseases\n- being born with a narrow spinal canal\nOften people experience no symptoms, but in some cases it can cause irritation of these tissues. However, the nerves can learn to cope with this narrower tunnel. It&#8217;s important to note that pain does not always mean the nerves are being damaged.\nPain can also be influenced by anything that impacts general health, such as poor sleep, stress and emotional wellbeing.\nMany people have a combination of pain, numbness and weakness affecting the low back and legs or neck and arms. These symptoms can be distressing, but don’t necessarily require urgent medical attention.\nOccasionally spinal stenosis can lead to serious conditions called cauda equina syndrome or cervical myelopathy. These are rare, but serious spinal conditions which can lead to permanent damage or disability. Early recognition and treatment can prevent further deterioration. If you develop these conditions, you may need to be seen by an emergency specialist team\nyou have experienced a new onset or significant worsening of:\nIf your GP practice is closed phone 111\nMany people can cope with their symptoms, as time can allow the nerves to adapt. Management options are based on a number of factors including individual’s symptoms, general health and patient preference.\nTreatment options include:\n- exercise can reduce nerve irritation and make the nerve more resilient to movement. It will not change the spinal tunnel narrowing itself\n- exercise may also help with general function, muscle strength and balance\n- physiotherapy can also be beneficial, you may be referred to this or their may be an option to self-refer in your area.\n- staying active\n- modifying activities and pacing techniques\n- maintaining a healthy weight\n- stopping smoking\n- managing stress and emotional wellbeing\n- medication\n- heat\n- ice\nRead more about taking painkillers\nAs well as these treatments your healthcare professional may advise you to monitor any change of your symptoms symptoms.\nIf symptoms are not improving and other treatments have been tried, other options include:\n- spinal injections\n- spinal surgery\n- specialist pain services\nIf you&#8217;ve been diagnosed with lumbar stenosis, although walking can be uncomfortable, it&#8217;s safe to continue walking as long as symptoms remain manageable. Walking short distances regularly is encouraged to help manage your symptoms.\nIf your leg symptoms are relieved by bending or leaning forward, it may be helpful to have regular breaks when walking. You can try taking a seat or leaning against a wall.\nIf you are struggling with walking, it may be helpful to talk to a healthcare professional about a walking aid.\nProblems linked to spinal stenosis can sometimes mean you need to take some time off work. This may depend on the nature of your symptoms and your role at work.\nYou do not need to be symptom-free before considering returning to work. Continuing to work or returning to work as soon as is possible will help your recovery. Gradually getting back to your normal daily activities can help to build up strength and stamina.\nFollowing this advice, you should see gradual improvements over time.

        "disease": "Spleen problems and spleen removal",
        "description": "Some people are born without a spleen or need to have it removed because of disease or injury.\nThe spleen is a fist-sized organ found&nbsp;in the upper left side of your abdomen, next to your stomach and behind your left ribs.&nbsp;\nIt&#8217;s an&nbsp;important part of your immune system but you can survive without it. This is because the liver can take over many of the spleen&#8217;s functions.\nThe spleen has a few important functions.\nIt fights any invading germs in the blood (the spleen contains infection-fighting white blood cells).\nIt controls the level of blood cells. The spleen controls the level of white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets (small cells that form blood clots).\nIt screens the blood and removes any old or damaged red blood cells.\nIf the spleen doesn&#8217;t work properly, it may start to remove healthy blood cells. This&nbsp;can lead to:\n- anaemia, from a reduced number of red blood cells\n- an increased risk of infection, from a reduced number of white blood cells\n- bleeding or bruising, from a reduced number of platelets\nSpleen pain is usually felt as a pain behind your left ribs. It may be tender when you touch the area.&nbsp;This can be a sign of a damaged, ruptured or enlarged spleen.\nThe spleen can become damaged or may rupture (burst) after a forceful blow to the abdomen,&nbsp;car accident, sporting accident or fracture&nbsp;to the ribs.&nbsp;\nRupture can happen straight away or it may happen weeks after the injury.\nSigns of a ruptured spleen are:\n- pain behind your left ribs and tenderness when you touch this area\n- dizziness and a rapid heart rate (a sign of low blood pressure caused by blood loss)\nSometimes, if you lie down and raise your legs, the pain can be felt at the tip of your left shoulder.\nA ruptured spleen is a medical emergency, as it can cause life-threatening bleeding.\nThe spleen can become swollen after an infection or injury. It can also become enlarged as a result of a disease such as cirrhosis, leukaemia or rheumatoid arthritis.\nAn enlarged spleen doesn&#8217;t always cause symptoms. Otherwise, look out for:\n- feeling full very quickly after eating (an enlarged spleen can press on the stomach)\n- feeling discomfort or pain behind your left ribs&nbsp;\n- anaemia and/or fatigue\n- frequent infections\n- easy bleeding\nDoctors can often tell if you have an enlarged spleen by feeling your abdomen. A blood test, CT scan or MRI scan would confirm the diagnosis.\nThe spleen is not usually removed if it&#8217;s just enlarged. Instead, you&#8217;ll receive treatment for any underlying condition and your spleen will be monitored. Antibiotics may be prescribed if there&#8217;s an infection.\nYou&#8217;ll need to avoid contact sports for a while, as you&#8217;ll be at greater risk of rupturing the spleen while it is enlarged.\nSurgery is only necessary if the enlarged spleen is causing serious complications or if the cause can&#8217;t be found.\nAn operation to remove the spleen, known as a splenectomy, may be needed if the spleen is damaged, diseased or enlarged.\nIt may sometimes be more appropriate to have just part of your spleen removed&nbsp;– a partial splenectomy.\nIf there&#8217;s time, you&#8217;ll be advised to have a series of immunisations before the operation.\nMost splenectomies are carried out using laparoscopy (keyhole surgery).\nA laparoscope is long, thin, flexible instrument with&nbsp;its own light source. It is attached to a camera and&nbsp;will relay high definition, magnified pictures back to a TV screen to guide the surgeon&#8217;s instruments.\nLaparoscopic splenectomy allows a surgeon to access the inside of your abdomen without having to make large incisions (cuts) in your skin. However, you will still need a general anaesthetic.\nThe procedure involves:\n- making several incisions in your abdomen (tummy area)\n- guiding a laparoscope into your body through one of the incisions, so doctors can see what they&#8217;re doing\n- passing thin instruments into your abdomen through the other incisions, to remove your spleen – gas will be pumped into your abdomen&nbsp;to make this easier\nThe incisions will then be stitched up or sometimes glued together.&nbsp;You may be able to go home the same day, or may need to stay in hospital overnight. If you go home the same day, someone will need to stay with you for the first 24 hours.\nOpen surgery, where one large incision is made, may be needed if the spleen is too large or too damaged to be removed via keyhole surgery.&nbsp;Often, in emergencies, this will be the preferred method to rapidly control bleeding.\nYou&#8217;ll need a general anaesthetic and may need to stay in hospital for a few days to recover.\nIt&#8217;s normal to feel sore and be bruised after a splenectomy, but you&#8217;ll be given pain relief medication.\nYou should be able to eat and drink as normal soon after the operation.\nLike any operation, a splenectomy carries a small risk of complications, including bleeding and infection.\nYour doctor will run through these risks with you.\nYou should be given breathing and leg movement exercises to do&nbsp;at home, to reduce your risk of getting a blood clot or a chest infection.\nAnother risk is the surgical wound becoming infected. If you spot any signs of infection, contact your GP or hospital immediately, as you&nbsp;may need antibiotics.\nRecovery usually takes a few weeks. Your doctor or nurse will advise when you can go back to your usual activities, such as driving.\nIf your spleen needs to be removed, other organs such as the liver can take over many of the spleen&#8217;s functions.&nbsp;\nThis means&nbsp;you will still be able to cope with most infections. However, there is a small risk that a serious infection may develop quickly.&nbsp;This risk will be present for the rest of your life.\nYoung children have a higher risk of serious infection than adults, but the risk is still small. The risk is also increased if you have a medical condition such as sickle cell anaemia, coeliac disease&nbsp;or a condition that affects your immune system, such as HIV.\nThis risk can be minimised by following simple precautions to prevent infection.\nRead about vaccinations for children and adults without a fully working spleen.\nIt&#8217;s recommended that you take low-dose antibiotics for the rest of your life to prevent bacterial infections. Antibiotics are particularly important:\n- for children under the age of 16\n- for the first 2 years after your spleen is removed&nbsp;\n- if your immune system doesn&#8217;t work properly\nWatch out for signs of infection, such as:\n- high temperature (fever)\n- sore throat&nbsp;\n- cough\n- severe headache&nbsp;\n- headache with drowsiness or a rash&nbsp;\n- abdominal pain&nbsp;\n- redness and swelling around the surgical wound\nYour GP can prescribe a course of antibiotics for you to use if you get an infection. You should start taking them at the first sign of an infection, so see your GP as soon as possible.\nIf your infection becomes serious, you will be admitted to hospital.\nBites from animals&nbsp;and ticks (small blood-sucking parasites) can cause infections.\nIf you get bitten by an animal, particularly a dog, start your course of antibiotics and seek medical advice urgently.\nIf you go trekking or camping regularly, you may be at risk of babesiosis, which is a rare disease transmitted by ticks. Try to avoid tick bites by wearing clothes that cover your skin, particularly long trousers. If you become ill, get medical advice straight away.\nHealthcare professionals will mark your health records to show that you don&#8217;t have a working spleen. However, always remember to tell any medical professionals that you see, including your dentist.\nIt&#8217;s a good idea to carry or wear some medical ID. For example:\n- if your spleen is removed, the hospital may give you a splenectomy card to take home with you\n- you may want to buy your own medical ID, such as a MedicAlert or Medi-Tag bracelet or pendant&nbsp;\nIf you need help or emergency treatment, your medical ID will alert the staff to your condition.\nRead advice about travelling abroad without a fully working spleen.\nThe scars from your operation will gradually fade."

There’s no right or wrong way to feel.\nIf you already have children, think about how they might be feeling too and what support they’ll need.\nThis is a very difficult time for you and everyone close to you so it’s important to support each other and ask for help if you need it.\nThe stillbirth or death of a newborn baby can happen for lots of reasons and doctors don’t yet know all the causes.\nSome are linked to problems with the placenta or mum’s health and others to the baby&#8217;s health or development but in some cases the reason can’t be explained.\nAlthough there are many reasons that a stillbirth can happen, you can decrease the risk by maintaining a health lifestyle before and during pregnancy.\nRead more about living a healthy lifestyle during pregnancy\nIf your baby dies before birth, labour is usually induced. Going through labour and giving birth is the safest option for most women, even though it can be very distressing.\nIt’s natural to want to know why this happened. It’s not always possible to know why your baby died and that can be hard to come to terms with.\nYour midwife and obstetrician will be there to support you through it. They will tell you what to expect and give you whatever help you need.\nYour midwife or doctor will ask if you’d like to see or hold your baby. You might want to involve other members of your family too.\nIf you’re worried about what your baby looks like, your midwife or doctor can describe them to help you decide. Many parents find it comforting to see, touch and hold their baby and, if you want to, you can bath and dress them.\nYour midwife can talk to you about a Cuddle Cot, a special cooling mattress inside a cot which can let you spend more time with your baby in the hospital or at home.\nThis gives you more time to say goodbye, with the support of family and friends.\nIf the hospital doesn’t have a Cuddle Cot then there are other organisations that can organise one for bereaved parents. Ask your midwife.\nWhat you choose to do is very personal and individual, as is the way you grieve.\nSpecialist help and support is available for parents and families who have lost a baby and your midwife, family nurse and health visitor can help you to find the right support locally.\nYour baby’s stillbirth must be registered. Your midwife and the hospital staff can advise you how to do this.\nYou can’t officially register a baby lost before 24 weeks of pregnancy, but some hospitals will give you a certificate in memory of your baby if you ask.\nMore about&nbsp;registering the death of a baby\nYou’ll need time to think what you’d like for your baby’s funeral. This could be a burial or cremation with a service in the style of your choice. Take as much time as you need to decide on the right way to say goodbye.\nAll hospitals in Scotland will offer a funeral service for your baby free of charge or you may choose to make your own private arrangements, which can give you more choice and control.\nMore about&nbsp;funeral arrangements\nEveryone reacts differently to the loss of a baby. Your emotions might be overwhelming and you might feel physically drained too.\nTake time to rest and look after yourself. It’s important to know you are not alone and have done nothing wrong.\nMore about&nbsp;coping with the loss of a baby\nIf you lost your baby after 13 weeks, you&#8217;ll be offered a post-mortem (autopsy). This is a medical investigation to try to understand what happened and find out if there are issues that could affect a future pregnancy\nWhether or not to have a post-mortem can be a difficult decision and you’ll be given support and time to think it over. If you have questions or worries, ask the person who discusses the post-mortem with you.\nYou will need care from your midwife and doctor to make sure your body is recovering. Your midwife will assist you through all the decisions you need to make and help you to find the right support.\nYou don’t have to manage alone and it can sometimes help to talk with others who have been through baby loss. You, your baby’s father or your partner and your family are likely to need time to grieve.\nSome parents find it helps to do something to remember their baby, like:\n- creating a space in their garden\n- saying a prayer\n- writing a poem\nOthers keep photographs, handprints or footprints, or locks of their baby&#8217;s hair in a memory box. No matter what stage of pregnancy your loss is, you can make a memory box – ask your midwife about this. Some hospitals give special boxes to parents just for this.\nSome parents don’t want to do any of these things, and that’s okay too.

        "description": "Stomach cancer, or gastric cancer, is a fairly uncommon type of cancer.&nbsp;\nThe initial&nbsp;symptoms of stomach cancer are vague and easy to mistake for other less serious&nbsp;conditions.&nbsp;They include:\n- persistent&nbsp;indigestion and heartburn\n- trapped wind and frequent burping\n- feeling very full or bloated after meals\n- persistent stomach pain\nSymptoms of advanced stomach cancer can include:\n- blood in your stools, or black stools\n- loss of appetite\n- weight loss\nAs the early&nbsp;symptoms of stomach cancer are similar to those of many other&nbsp;conditions, the cancer is often advanced by the time it&#8217;s diagnosed. It&#8217;s therefore important to get any possible symptoms of stomach cancer checked by your GP as soon as possible.\nRead more about diagnosing stomach cancer\nThe exact cause of stomach cancer is still unclear, although you&#8217;re more likely to develop it if you:\n- are male\n- are 55 years of age or older\n- smoke\n- have a diet low in fibre and high in processed food or red meat\n- have a diet that contains a lot of salted and pickled foods\n- have a stomach infection caused by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria&nbsp;\nRead more about the causes of stomach cancer.\nThere are several different types of stomach cancer. More than 95% of stomach cancers develop in the cells of the stomach lining and are known as adenocarcinomas.\nLess common types of stomach cancer include lymphoma of the stomach, which develops in the lymphatic tissue (tissue that drains away fluid and helps fight infection), and gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs), which develop in the muscle or connective tissue of the stomach wall.\nMany cases of stomach cancer can&#8217;t be completely cured, but it&#8217;s still possible to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life using chemotherapy&nbsp;and in some cases&nbsp;radiotherapy and surgery.\nIf operable, surgery can cure stomach cancer as long as all of the cancerous tissue&nbsp;can be removed.\nSurgery to remove some or all of the stomach is known as a&nbsp;gastrectomy. It will still be possible to eat normally after a gastrectomy, but you&#8217;ll probably have to adjust the size of your portions.&nbsp;\nChemotherapy can also be used before surgery to help shrink the tumour and sometimes after surgery to help prevent the cancer returning.\nRead more about treating stomach cancer\nLiving with stomach cancer and the effects of surgery can be tough, but there are a range of services that can provide social, psychological and financial support.\nRead more about living with stomach cancer\nMany symptoms of stomach cancer are similar to less serious conditions, so it can be difficult to recognise in the early stages.\nEarly stage symptoms include:\n- persistent indigestion \n- trapped wind and frequent burping\n- heartburn\n- feeling full very quickly when eating\n- feeling bloated after eating\n- feeling sick\n- pain in your stomach or breastbone\n- difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)\n- vomiting (the vomit may be streaked with blood), although this is uncommon in the early stages\nSymptoms of more advanced stomach cancer include:\n- blood in your stools, or black stools\n- loss of appetite\n- weight loss\n- tiredness\n- lumpiness and swelling in your stomach (caused by a build-up of fluid)\n- anaemia&nbsp;(a reduced number of red blood cells that can cause you to feel tired and breathless)\n- yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)\nStomach cancer is usually easier to treat if it&#8217;s diagnosed early. It&#8217;s therefore&nbsp;important for your GP to refer you to a specialist as soon as possible if stomach cancer is suspected.\nStomach cancer is much more common in older people, with 90 out of 100 cases occurring in people who are over 55 years of age.\nIndigestion is a very common symptom in the general population. However, it&#8217;s unlikely that someone with indigestion who&#8217;s under the age of 55 will have stomach cancer.\nHowever,&nbsp;see your GP if you have indigestion and weight loss, anaemia or persistent vomiting. They&nbsp;should refer you to a specialist for further testing.\nAlso see your GP if you have difficulty swallowing. This&nbsp;isn&#8217;t a common symptom among the general population and the cause should always be investigated.\nRead more about diagnosing stomach cancer\nStomach cancer is caused by changes in the cells of the stomach, although it&#8217;s unclear exactly why these changes occur.\nCancer begins with a change (mutation) in the structure of the DNA in cells, which can affect how they grow. This means cells grow and reproduce&nbsp;uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour.\nLeft untreated, cancer can spread to other parts of the body, usually through the lymphatic system (a network of vessels and glands called lymph nodes located throughout the body).\nOnce the cancer reaches your lymphatic system, it&#8217;s capable of spreading to other parts of your body, including your blood, bones and organs.\nIt&#8217;s not known what triggers the&nbsp;changes in DNA&nbsp;that lead to stomach cancer and why only a small number of people develop the condition.\nHowever, evidence suggests that a number of different factors can affect your&nbsp;chances of developing stomach cancer.\nYour risk of developing stomach cancer increases with age. Most cases occur in people aged 55 or over.\nFor reasons that are unclear, men are twice as likely as women to develop stomach cancer.\nPeople who smoke are about twice as likely to develop stomach cancer compared with non-smokers. This is because you swallow some cigarette smoke when you inhale and it ends up in your stomach. Cigarettes contain&nbsp;harmful chemicals which can damage the cells in your stomach.\nThe more you smoke and the longer you&#8217;ve been smoking, the bigger the risk.&nbsp;In the UK, around 1&nbsp;in every 5 cases of stomach cancer (20%) is thought to be caused by smoking.\nHelicobacter pylori (H. pylori)&nbsp;is a common type of bacteria. In most people, these bacteria are harmless, but&nbsp;in some people an H. pylori infection can cause problems such as&nbsp;stomach ulcers, recurring bouts of&nbsp;indigestion or&nbsp;long-term inflammation of the stomach lining (chronic atrophic gastritis).\nResearch has found&nbsp;people with severe chronic&nbsp;atrophic gastritis have&nbsp;an increased&nbsp;risk of developing stomach cancer, although this risk is still small.\nA diet rich in pickled vegetables, such as pickled onions or piccalilli, salted fish, salt in general and smoked meats, such as pastrami or smoked beef, increases your risk of stomach cancer.\nCountries where this type of diet is popular, such as Japan, tend to have much higher rates of stomach cancer than the UK.\nA high fibre diet with 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day&nbsp;will help protect against stomach cancer, and a diet high in fats and processed food and red meat will increase your risk of getting stomach cancer.\nYou&#8217;re more likely to develop stomach cancer if you have a close relative with the condition, such as one of your parents or a sibling (brother or sister). In such cases, it may be appropriate for your doctor to arrange genetic counselling.\nIt&#8217;s not fully understood why stomach cancer seems to run in families. It may be because of shared risk factors, such as having similar diets or having an H. pylori infection, or because of certain genes you inherit from your parents.\nIn around 1 in 50 cases of stomach cancer, testing has found that people share a mutation in a gene known as E-cadherin.\nYou may be more at risk of getting the condition if you have the blood type A. Your&nbsp;blood type is passed on from your parents, so this could be another way in which family history may increase your risk of developing stomach cancer.\nThere&#8217;s also a condition that runs in families called familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), which may increase your risk of developing stomach cancer. FAP causes small growths, called polyps, to form in your digestive system, and is known to increase your risk of developing bowel cancer.\nYour risk of developing stomach cancer is increased if you&#8217;ve had another type of cancer, such as&nbsp;cancer of the oesophagus or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (cancer that develops in your white blood cells).\nFor men, the risk of getting stomach cancer is increased after having&nbsp;prostate cancer, bladder cancer,&nbsp;breast cancer&nbsp;or testicular cancer. For women, the risk of developing stomach cancer increases after having&nbsp;ovarian cancer, breast cancer or cervical cancer.\nHaving certain medical conditions can also increase your risk of developing stomach cancer, such as pernicious anaemia&nbsp;(a vitamin B12 deficiency, which occurs when your body can&#8217;t absorb it properly), and peptic stomach ulcers&nbsp;(an ulcer in your stomach lining, often caused by H. pylori infection).\nIf you&#8217;ve had stomach surgery, or surgery to a part of your body that affects your stomach, you may be more likely to develop stomach cancer.\nThis can include surgery to remove part of your stomach (known as a partial gastrectomy), surgery to remove part of your vagus nerve (the nerve that carries information from your brain to organs such as your heart, lungs and digestive system), or surgery to repair a stomach ulcer.\nThere are 3 ways stomach cancer can spread:\n- directly –&nbsp;the cancer can spread from the stomach into nearby tissues and organs, such as the pancreas, colon, small intestine and peritoneum (the lining of the inside of the abdominal cavity)\n- through&nbsp;the lymphatic system – the lymphatic system is a series of glands (nodes) located throughout your body, similar to the blood circulatory system; the glands produce specialised cells needed by your immune system to fight infection\n- through&nbsp;the blood –&nbsp;which can cause the cancer to spread from the stomach to other parts of the body, most commonly the liver\nStomach cancer that spreads to another part of the body is known as metastatic stomach cancer.\nSpeak to your GP as soon as possible if you have stomach cancer symptoms such as indigestion, unexpected weight loss, anaemia and persistent vomiting.\nYour GP will ask about your symptoms and examine your stomach for any lumpiness or tenderness. If they think that stomach cancer may be a possibility they&#8217;ll refer you to a specialist for further investigation.\nIn 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of stomach cancer and refer people for the right tests faster.\nFind out who should be referred for further tests for suspected stomach cancer.\nIf your GP thinks you may have stomach cancer, they&#8217;ll refer you to a specialist for tests.\nThese may include a blood test and chest&nbsp;X-ray, which will assess your overall health. A sample of your stools may also be tested for blood.\nBecause of&nbsp;the potentially serious nature of stomach cancer, you should be referred to the specialist within 2 weeks.\nRead more about waiting times.\nAn endoscopy is a procedure where the inside of your body is examined using a piece of equipment called an endoscope (a long, thin flexible tube with a light and a video camera at the end).\nIf you need to have an endoscopy, you won&#8217;t be able to eat or drink for four to eight hours before the procedure. This is to ensure your stomach and duodenum (top of the small intestine) are empty.\nYou&#8217;ll be awake during the endoscopy, but may be given a sedative by injection to make you feel drowsy and relaxed. A&nbsp;local anaesthetic&nbsp;may also be sprayed onto the back of your throat, so the area is numbed.\nThe endoscope will be passed down your gullet (food pipe) and into your stomach so the specialist can look for any stomach ulcers or signs of cancer. If tissue is found that may be cancerous, a sample will be taken for testing. This procedure is known as a biopsy. The sample will be examined under a microscope in a laboratory. The results will show whether the cells are cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign) and will usually take 7 to 10 days to come back.\nThe endoscopy itself usually takes about 15 minutes, although you should allow about 2 hours in total for your visit.\nIf your specialist thinks you may have cancer in the top part of your stomach, you may have an ultrasound scan at the same time as an endoscopy. This is known as an endoscopic ultrasound and uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of your stomach (this method is commonly used to view an unborn baby in the womb).\nIf you have an endoscopic ultrasound, an ultrasound probe will be attached to the end of the endoscope before it&#8217;s passed down your throat. The scan will help determine the stage of any cancer in the top part of your stomach.\nAfter an endoscopy, or an endoscopic ultrasound, you won&#8217;t be able to drive for several hours because of the sedative. You may also have a sore throat, although this should pass within a few days.\nA barium meal X-ray or barium swallow involves drinking a chalky liquid containing a substance called barium, which makes your stomach show up on an X-ray. Nowadays, however, it&#8217;s less commonly used to diagnose stomach cancers.\nOrgans such as your stomach don&#8217;t usually show up on an X-ray because they&#8217;re made of soft tissue that isn&#8217;t dense enough to stop the X-rays passing through. However, when these organs are filled with barium, it blocks the X-rays and shows up white on an X-ray screen.\nYou won&#8217;t able to eat or drink for at least 6 hours before the procedure because your stomach and duodenum need to be empty. You may be given an injection to relax the muscles in your digestive system.\nA barium swallow usually takes about 15 minutes. Afterwards, you&#8217;ll be able to eat and drink as normal, although you may need to drink more water to help flush the barium out of your system. You may feel slightly sick, and the barium may cause constipation. Your stools may be white for a few days afterwards as the barium passes through your system.\nIf you&#8217;re diagnosed with stomach cancer, further tests may be needed to help determine how far it&#8217;s spread and how quickly it&#8217;s likely to spread (known as the stage and grade). Your cancer specialist (oncologist) will discuss this with you.\nHowever, it may not always be possible to identify the exact stage of your condition until your treatment starts.\nYour specialist may need to examine your stomach in more detail to see if the cancer has spread, particularly to the lining of the abdominal cavity (peritoneum). If it has, you may need to have a small operation called a laparoscopy. This procedure is carried out under a general anaesthetic, so you&#8217;ll be unconscious during it.\nDuring the procedure, a thin viewing tube with a camera at the end (a laparoscope) will be inserted into your stomach through a small incision in the lower part of your tummy. In some cases, your specialist may need to examine more than one area of your stomach and make more than one incision.\nDuring CT scans or PET scans, a series of X-ray images of your body are taken. A computer is then used to put the images together and create a detailed picture of the inside of your body.\nThese scans will help your doctor assess how advanced your cancer is. It allows them to see whether the cancerous cells have formed tumours anywhere else in the body. The scans can also&nbsp;help your doctors work out which type of treatment will be most effective and appropriate for you.\nIf your specialist thinks your stomach cancer may have spread to your liver, you may need to have a liver ultrasound. This type of scan uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of your liver.\nAfter all of the tests have been completed and your test results are known, it should be possible to tell what stage and grade of stomach cancer you have.\nStaging is a measurement of how far cancer has spread. There are a number of different ways stomach cancer can be staged.&nbsp;One method uses a numbering system from 1 to 4. The higher the number, the further the cancer has spread.\nThe majority of stomach cancers are at stage 3 or 4 when diagnosed, which means a cure isn&#8217;t&nbsp;usually possible.\nGrading describes how quickly the cancer is likely to spread in the future. There are 3 grades of stomach cancer:\n- low-grade – the cancer tends to grow slowly\n- medium-grade – the cancer grows a bit&nbsp;faster\n- high-grade – the cancer is aggressive and likely to grow quickly\nCancer Research UK has more information about the staging and grading of stomach cancer.\nThe treatments recommended for stomach cancer will depend on your general health and how far the cancer has spread.\nMost hospitals use multidisciplinary teams made up of a number of different specialists (see below) who work together to plan and carry out&nbsp;the best treatment, tailored to your circumstances.\nFeel free to discuss treatment with your care team at any time and ask questions.\nThe main treatments for stomach cancer are surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. You may have 1 of these treatments or a combination.\nIf surgery is recommended, you may have chemotherapy beforehand. If the tumour is in the upper part of your stomach, including the junction between the oesophagus and stomach, you may also have radiotherapy prior to surgery.\nSurgery is mainly used if stomach cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, whereas chemotherapy and radiotherapy tend to be used when the condition is diagnosed at a later stage.\nWhere possible, the primary aim of treatment is to completely&nbsp;remove the tumour and any other cancerous cells in your body.&nbsp;It&#8217;s estimated that a cure is possible in 20 to 30% of stomach cancer cases.\nIf it&#8217;s not possible to remove the tumour, your doctors will focus on trying to prevent it from getting any bigger and causing further harm to your body. This may be done using surgery or chemotherapy.&nbsp;\nIn some cases, it&#8217;s not possible to eliminate the cancer or slow it down. In this case, your treatment will aim to relieve your symptoms and make you as comfortable as possible, usually with surgery or radiotherapy.\nA relatively new medication called&nbsp;trastuzumab (see below) can also be used to treat some types of advanced stomach cancer.\nYour healthcare team will talk to you about which treatments are most suitable.\nIf you&#8217;re diagnosed with stomach cancer at an early stage,&nbsp;it may be possible for the cancer to be completely removed during surgery.\nIn some cases, it may be possible to pass a thin, flexible tube (endoscope) down your oesophagus (gullet),&nbsp;rather than making incisions in your tummy. This is known as endoscopic surgery, and can be used to&nbsp;remove a sample of the tumour for testing (biopsy). It can also be used to remove the tumour completely if stomach cancer is diagnosed at an early stage.\nHowever, if your cancer has spread beyond your stomach, it may not be possible to remove it completely. If this is the case, you may still have surgery to remove any cancer blocking your stomach, to ease your symptoms. This will depend on whether your symptoms can be controlled and the risks and side effects of undertaking major surgery.\nAny type of surgery for stomach cancer will involve a large operation and a long recovery time. If you have stomach cancer surgery, you&#8217;ll usually need to stay in hospital for around 2 weeks. You&#8217;ll also need several weeks at home to recover.\nYou may&nbsp;need to have part or all of your stomach removed.\nSurgery to remove part of your stomach is known as a partial or sub-total gastrectomy, and surgery to remove all of your stomach is known as a total gastrectomy. In some cases, your surgeon may remove part of your oesophagus as well as all of&nbsp;your stomach, using&nbsp;a procedure known as an oesophagogastrectomy.\nThese operations may be carried out&nbsp;using either a large incision in your tummy (open surgery), or a number of smaller incisions through which surgical tools can be passed (laparoscopic or keyhole surgery). Both of these techniques are carried out under general anaesthetic, which means you&#8217;ll be unconscious throughout the procedure.\nDuring these operations, your surgeon will also remove the lymph nodes (small glands that help fight infection) nearest to the cancer. It&#8217;s possible that your stomach cancer may have spread to these lymph nodes, and removing them helps prevent the cancer returning.\nIf your cancer is in the lower part of your stomach, you may have a partial gastrectomy&nbsp;to&nbsp;remove it.\nAfter surgery, your stomach will be smaller than it was before the operation. However, the top part of your stomach, where your oesophagus feeds into it, won&#8217;t be affected.\nIf your cancer is in the middle or at the top of your stomach, you may need to have a total gastrectomy. If the cancer is close to the end of your oesophagus, where it meets your stomach, you may&nbsp;need to have an oesophagogastrectomy.\nIf you have a total gastrectomy, the end of your gullet will be joined to the top of your jejunum (the top part of your small intestine). If you have an oesophagogastrectomy, the remaining part of your gullet will be joined to your jejunum.\nIf your stomach cancer has spread beyond your stomach, it may not be possible to remove it using surgery.\nHowever, if your stomach has been significantly affected by cancer it can cause a blockage, which prevents food from being properly digested. A blocked stomach can cause symptoms such as stomach pain, vomiting and feeling very full after eating.\nIf your stomach is blocked, there are a few options:&nbsp;\n- stenting – a stent is a plastic or wire mesh tube inserted through the oesophagus using an endoscope under local anaesthetic; after being inserted, the stent will be expanded and open up the stomach&nbsp;\n- partial or total gastrectomy – to remove the blockage and improve your symptoms\n- bypass surgery – an operation where part of your stomach above the blockage is joined to your&nbsp;small intestine, leaving the blocked part of your stomach out of your digestive system\nChemotherapy is a specialist treatment for cancer that uses medicines, called cytotoxic medicines,&nbsp;to stop cancer cells dividing and multiplying. As it circulates through your body, the medicine can target cancer cells in your stomach and any that may have spread to other parts of your body.\nYou may have chemotherapy for stomach cancer before surgery to reduce the amount of cancer that has to be removed during the operation. Chemotherapy can also be used after surgery to destroy any remaining cancer cells and prevent the cancer from coming back.\nChemotherapy can also help to slow the progression of cancer and ease the symptoms of more advanced stomach cancer, which may not be suitable for surgery.\nIf may be given orally (as tablets) or intravenously (by injection or a drip through a vein directly into your bloodstream), or a combination of both.\nIntravenous chemotherapy is usually given in hospital, while oral chemotherapy is taken at home. Chemotherapy is often given in cycles, each usually lasting about three weeks.\nAlternatively, chemotherapy may be administered through a small pump, which gives you a constant low dose over a few weeks or months. The pumps are portable and can be worn at home, which means fewer trips to hospital.\nChemotherapy works by preventing cancerous cells from growing rapidly. However, it also destroys non-cancerous cells such as&nbsp;hair follicles and red and white blood cells. Side effects may include:\n- tiredness\n- nausea and vomiting\n- nerve damage (peripheral neuropathy)\n- hair loss\n- diarrhoea&nbsp;\n- anaemia (a lack of red blood cells)\n- weight loss\n- skin changes – such as redness, swelling and a tingling sensation in the palms of the hands and/or soles of the feet\nThe side effects you experience after having chemotherapy will depend on the type of chemotherapy and the number of treatment sessions you need. You&#8217;ll be told who to contact if you&#8217;re experiencing serious side effects from chemotherapy, and it&#8217;s very important that this contact information is recorded carefully.\nIf you experience nausea and vomiting as a result of chemotherapy, you may be able to take anti-sickness medication to counter it. This may be given intravenously (by injection directly into your bloodstream) at the same time as your chemotherapy.\nThe side effects of chemotherapy will only last for as long as your course of treatment lasts. Once your treatment is over, the&nbsp;hair follicles&nbsp;and blood cells&nbsp;will repair themselves. This means your hair will grow back, although it might look or feel different from how it did before chemotherapy (for example, it may be a slightly different colour, or be softer or curlier than before).\nRadiotherapy uses beams of high energy&nbsp;radiation to destroy cancer cells. It&#8217;s not often used to treat stomach cancer because there&#8217;s a risk that other organs close to your stomach might be damaged by the treatment.\nHowever, if you have advanced stomach cancer that&#8217;s causing pain or bleeding,&nbsp;you may need to have radiotherapy. In some cases, following surgery, you may have chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy to help prevent the stomach cancer from recurring.\nIf a cancer is bleeding slowly and causing anaemia, a single fraction of radiotherapy can be used to try to prevent further bleeding.\nIf you need radiotherapy, your treatment will usually begin 2 or 3 months after surgery or chemotherapy, to give your body a chance to recover. This is a painless procedure where you lie under a radiotherapy machine while it directs radiation at your stomach. You&#8217;ll be positioned by a radiographer (a specialist in radiotherapy) so that the machine targets the cancer cells and avoids as much healthy tissue as possible.\nRadiotherapy often involves having treatment sessions 5 days a week. Each session will only last a few minutes. The radiation doesn&#8217;t stay in your system afterwards, and it&#8217;s perfectly safe to be around others between your treatments.\nHow long you&#8217;ll need to have radiotherapy for will depend on how it&#8217;s used. Radiotherapy used after surgery to help prevent stomach cancer coming back usually lasts 5 weeks. If it&#8217;s being used to control symptoms of advanced stomach cancer, it may only last 1 or 2 weeks.\nYou may experience the following side effects after having radiotherapy:\n- tiredness\n- nausea\n- diarrhoea\n- irritation and darkening of your skin where the treatment takes place\nThese side effects will usually improve within a few weeks of treatment finishing.\nTrastuzumab&nbsp;(sold under the brand name Herceptin) is a medication&nbsp;used to treat&nbsp;breast cancer and some cases of advanced stomach cancer.\nSome stomach cancers are stimulated by a type of protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Trastuzumab works by blocking the effects of this protein. This doesn&#8217;t cure stomach cancer, but&nbsp;it can slow its growth and increase survival time.\nIf you&#8217;re diagnosed with advanced stomach cancer and tests show high levels of the HER2 protein in the cancerous cells, your doctors may recommend treatment with a combination of chemotherapy and trastuzumab.\nTrastuzumab is given intravenously, through a drip, and you&#8217;ll have the treatment in hospital. Each treatment session takes up to 1 hour and you&#8217;ll usually need a session once every 3 weeks.\nTrastuzumab can cause side effects, including heart problems. Therefore, it may not be suitable if you have a heart problem such as angina, uncontrolled high blood pressure (hypertension) or heart valve disease. If you need to take trastuzumab, you&#8217;ll also need regular tests on your heart to check for any problems.\nOther side effects of trastuzumab may include:\n- an initial allergic reaction to the medication, which can cause nausea, wheezing, chills and fever\n- diarrhoea\n- tiredness\n- aches and pains\nBeing diagnosed with cancer is a tough challenge for most people, but support is available to help you cope.\nYou may find the following&nbsp;advice helpful:\n- keep talking to your friends and family &#8211;&nbsp;they can be a powerful support system\n- talk to others in the same situation\n- research your condition\n- set reasonable goals\n- take time out for yourself\nCancer charities, such as Macmillan Cancer Support, are a good source of information and support.\nGetting back to normal after surgery can take time. It&#8217;s important to take things slowly and give yourself time to recover. During your recovery,&nbsp;avoid lifting heavy things such as children or shopping bags, and strenuous tasks such as housework. You may also be advised not to drive.\nSome other treatments, particularly&nbsp;chemotherapy and&nbsp;radiotherapy, can make you very tired. You may need to take a break from some of your normal activities for a while. Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask for practical help from family and friends.\nAfter your treatment has finished, you&#8217;ll be invited for regular check-ups, usually every three months for the first year. During the check-up, your doctor will examine you and may arrange blood tests or scans to see how you&#8217;re responding to treatment.\nIf you&#8217;ve had an operation to remove part of your stomach (partial gastrectomy), you&#8217;ll only be able to eat small amounts of food for a while after your operation. This is because your stomach won&#8217;t be able to hold as much food as it could before the surgery, and your body will need to adjust to its new stomach capacity. You should gradually be able to increase the amount you eat as your stomach begins to expand.\nIf you&#8217;ve had surgery to remove all of your stomach (total gastrectomy), it may be some time before you can eat normally again. As with a partial gastrectomy, you&#8217;ll only be able to eat small amounts of food until your body adjusts. You may have to eat little and often, and make changes to the types of food you eat. Your care team will be able to advise you about what and when you should eat.\nHaving surgery to remove your stomach also means you&#8217;ll need to have regular injections of vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 is usually absorbed through your stomach from the food you eat and is needed to help prevent&nbsp;a condition called anaemia and nerve problems.\nEat regularly and healthily. You may not have time to sit down for every meal, but you should make time to do so at least once a day.\nIt&#8217;s understandable if there are times when you feel resentful, and then guilty for feeling so. You may also feel exhausted, isolated and worry about the person you care for.&nbsp;Remember: you&#8217;re human, and those feelings are natural.\nIf your stomach cancer can&#8217;t be cured, your GP will give you support and any necessary pain relief (often alongside chemotherapy or radiotherapy, which can be used to reduce your symptoms).&nbsp;This is called palliative care.&nbsp;Support is also available for your family and friends."

        "disease": "Stomach ulcer",
        "description": "Stomach ulcers (gastric ulcers)&nbsp;are open sores that develop on the lining of the stomach. Ulcers can also occur in part of the intestine just beyond the stomach. These are called duodenal ulcers.\nStomach and duodenal ulcers are sometimes called peptic ulcers. This information applies to both.\nAlthough the most common symptom of a stomach ulcer is a burning or gnawing pain in the centre of the abdomen (tummy). Not all stomach ulcers are painful.\nSome people experience:\n- indigestion\n- heartburn\n- nausea (feeling sick)\nYou should speak to your GP if you think you have a stomach ulcer.\nMore about the symptoms of a stomach ulcer\nSpeak to your GP immediately (or phone 111) if:\n- your symptoms persist\n- you&#8217;re vomiting blood – the blood can appear bright red or have a dark brown, grainy appearance like coffee grounds\n- you&#8217;re passing dark, sticky, tar-like stools\n- you feel a sudden, sharp pain in your tummy that gets steadily worse\nThese could be a sign of a serious complication.\nStomach ulcers occur when the layer protecting the stomach lining from stomach acid breaks down. This allows the stomach lining to become damaged.\nThis is usually caused by:\n- an infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria\n- taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen or aspirin – particularly if they&#8217;re taken for a long time or at high doses\nThere&#8217;s little evidence that stress or certain foods causes stomach ulcers.\nMore about the causes of stomach ulcers\nYou&#8217;ll be treated using antibiotics if your ulcer was caused by a H. pylori infection. This kills the bacteria and should prevent the ulcer coming back.\nYou&#8217;ll be treated using a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) if your ulcer was caused by NSAIDs. Your doctor will prescribe these and discuss whether you should keep using NSAIDs. Alternative medication to NSAIDs, such as paracetamol, may be recommended.\nMost stomach ulcers take a few months to heal after treatment. However, stomach ulcers can come back after treatment, although this is less likely to happen if the underlying cause is addressed.\nMore about treating stomach ulcers\nComplications are rare but can be very serious and potentially life-threatening.\nThe main complications include:\n- bleeding at the site of the ulcer\n- the stomach lining at the site of the ulcer splits open – known as perforation\n- the ulcer blocks the movement of food through the digestive system – known as gastric obstruction\nMore about the complications of stomach ulcers\nThe most common symptom of a stomach ulcer is a burning or gnawing pain that develops in your abdomen (tummy).\nHowever, some stomach ulcers aren&#8217;t painful and are only noticed when a complication develops, such as bleeding from the ulcer.\nThe pain caused by a stomach ulcer can either travel:\n- out from the middle of your tummy up to your neck\n- down to your belly button\n- through to your back\nAnd:\n- can last from a few minutes to a few hours\n- often starts within a few hours of eating\n- can cause you to wake up during the night\nTaking antacids (indigestion medication) may temporarily relieve the pain, but it will keep coming back if the ulcer isn&#8217;t treated.\nLess common symptoms of a stomach ulcer include:\n- indigestion\n- heartburn\n- loss of appetite\n- feeling and being sick\n- weight loss\nSome people also find they burp or become bloated after eating fatty foods.\nStomach ulcers are usually caused by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\nThese can break down the stomach&#8217;s defence against the acid it produces to digest food. The stomach lining then becomes damaged causing an ulcer to form.\nH. pylori bacteria live in the stomach lining. The bacteria can irritate the stomach lining and make it more vulnerable to damage from stomach acid.\nInfections are common. It&#8217;s possible to be infected without realising it because the infection doesn&#8217;t usually cause symptoms.\nPeople of all ages can be infected. It&#8217;s not clear exactly why some people are more vulnerable to the effects of H. pylori bacteria than others.\nNSAIDs are medicines widely used to treat pain, a high temperature (fever) and inflammation (swelling).\nCommonly used NSAIDs include:\n- ibuprofen\n- aspirin\n- naproxen\n- diclofenac\nMany people take NSAIDs without having any side effects. But there&#8217;s always a risk the medication could cause problems, such as stomach ulcers, particularly if taken for a long time or at high doses.\nYou may be advised not to use NSAIDs if you currently have a stomach ulcer or if you&#8217;ve had one in the past. Paracetamol is a safer painkiller to use.\nMore about&nbsp;NSAIDs\nThere&#8217;s little evidence that stomach ulcers are caused by:\n- spicy foods\n- stress\n- alcohol\nBut these can make the symptoms worse.\nHowever, smoking can:\n- increase your risk of developing stomach ulcers\n- make treatment less effective\nIf your GP thinks you have an ulcer, they\n- will want to know if you&#8217;re taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\n- might test you for an Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection\nIn some cases, you may be referred for a gastroscopy to look for an ulcer inside your stomach.\nIf your GP thinks your symptoms might be caused by an H. pylori infection, you&#8217;ll be offered a:\n- urea breath test\n- stool antigen test – a small stool sample is tested for the bacteria\n- blood test\nYou&#8217;ll be given a special drink containing a chemical that&#8217;s broken down by H. pylori. Your breath is then analysed to see whether or not you have an H. pylori infection.\nA sample of your blood&#8217;s tested for antibodies to the H. pylori bacteria. Antibodies are proteins produced naturally in your blood to help fight infection.\nThis test&#8217;s now largely been replaced by the stool antigen test\nMore about blood tests\nA gastroscopy is a procedure that involves passing a thin, flexible tube (an endoscope) with a camera at one end into your mouth and down into your stomach and first section of the small intestine (duodenum).\nYou may:\n- be given a mild sedative injection before the procedure\n- have your throat sprayed with a local anaesthetic to make it more comfortable to pass the endoscope\nThe images taken by the camera will usually confirm or rule out an ulcer. A small tissue sample may also be taken from your stomach or duodenum to test for the H. pylori bacteria.\nYou&#8217;ll have this procedure as an outpatient in hospital. This means you won&#8217;t have to spend the night.\nYou may have a repeat gastroscopy after 4 to 6 weeks to check that the ulcer&#8217;s healed.\nIf you have a stomach ulcer, your treatment will depend on what caused it.\nWith treatment, most ulcers heal in a month or two.\nIf your stomach ulcer&#8217;s caused by a Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacterial infection, you&#8217;ll be given:\n- a course of antibiotics\n- a medication called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI)\nThis is also recommended if it&#8217;s thought your stomach ulcer&#8217;s caused by a combination of an H. pylori infection and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\nIf you have an H. pylori infection, you&#8217;ll usually be prescribed a course of 2 or 3 antibiotics.\nThe most commonly used antibiotics are:\n- amoxicillin\n- clarithromycin\n- metronidazole\nYou should take these twice a day for a week.\nThe side effects of these are usually mild, but can include:\n- feeling and being sick\n- diarrhoea\n- a metallic taste in your mouth\nYou&#8217;ll be re-tested at least 4 weeks after finishing your antibiotic course to see if there are any H. pylori bacteria left in your stomach. If there are, a further course of eradication therapy using different antibiotics may be given.\nIf your stomach ulcer&#8217;s caused by taking NSAIDs:\n- you&#8217;ll be given a course of PPI medication\n- your use of NSAIDs will be reviewed, and you may be advised to use an alternative painkiller\nYou may be advised to use an alternative painkiller not associated with stomach ulcers, such as paracetamol.\nCOX-2 inhibitors&nbsp;are sometimes recommended. These are an alternative type of NSAID that&#8217;s less likely to cause stomach ulcers.\nIf you&#8217;re taking low-dose aspirin to reduce your risk of blood clots, your GP will tell you whether you need to keep taking it.\nIf you do, you may also be prescribed long-term treatment with a PPI or H2-receptor antagonist to prevent further ulcers.\nIt&#8217;s important to understand the potential risks associated with continued NSAID use.\nYou&#8217;re more likely to develop another stomach ulcer and could experience a serious complication, such as internal bleeding.\nRead more about the complications of stomach ulcers\nPPIs work by reducing the amount of acid your stomach produces. This prevents further damage to the ulcer as it heals naturally.\nThe most commonly used PPIs are:\n- omeprazole\n- pantoprazole\n- lansoprazole\nThey&#8217;re usually prescribed for 4 to 8 weeks.\nSide effects of these are usually mild, but can include:\n- headaches\n- diarrhoea or constipation\n- feeling sick\n- abdominal (tummy) pain\n- dizziness\n- rashes\nThese should pass once treatment has been completed.\nSometimes a type of medication called H2-receptor antagonists are used instead of PPIs.\nThese also reduce the amount of acid your stomach produces.\nRanitidine is the most widely used H2-receptor antagonist for treating stomach ulcers.\nSide effects are uncommon, but can include:\n- diarrhoea\n- headaches\n- dizziness\n- rashes\n- tiredness\nAs these treatments can take several hours before they start to work, your GP may recommend taking additional antacid medication.\nAntacids:\n- neutralise your stomach acid\n- provide immediate, but short-term, symptom relief\n- should be taken when you experience symptoms or when you expect them, such as after meals or at bedtime\nSome antacids also contain a medicine called an alginate, which produces a protective coating on the lining of your stomach. Antacids containing alginates are best taken after meals.\nYou can buy these medications at pharmacies. Your pharmacist can tell you which is most suitable for you.\nSide effects of both medications are usually mild, but can include:\n- diarrhoea or constipation\n- farting\n- stomach cramps\n- feeling and being sick\nThere aren&#8217;t any special lifestyle measures you need to take during treatment.\nHowever, avoiding stress, alcohol, spicy foods and smoking may reduce your symptoms while your ulcer heals.\nComplications of stomach ulcers are rare, but can be very serious.\nThe main complications are:\n- internal bleeding\n- perforation – the lining of the stomach splits open\n- gastric outlet obstruction – the stomach ulcer obstructs the normal passage of food through your digestive system\nInternal bleeding&#8217;s the most common complication of stomach ulcers. It can occur when an ulcer develops at the site of a blood vessel.\nThe bleeding can either be slow and long-term, or rapid and severe.\nSlow, long-term bleeding can lead to anaemia.\nSymptoms of anaemia include:\n- fatigue\n- breathlessness\n- pale skin\n- heart palpitations (noticeable heartbeats)\nYou should visit your GP if you have persistent symptoms of anaemia. If they think you have a stomach ulcer, they may refer you to a gastroenterologist for an examination and treatment.\nMore about anaemia\nContact your GP or the NHS 24 111 service immediately if you have symptoms of more severe bleeding, including:\n- you&#8217;re vomiting blood – the blood can appear bright red or have a dark brown, grainy appearance like coffee grounds\n- you&#8217;re passing dark, sticky, tar-like stools\nAn endoscopy will be used to identify the cause of the bleeding. Treatment can be given during the endoscopy to stop the bleeding.\nSometimes:\n- specialised procedures carried out under X-ray&nbsp;guidance are used to stop bleeding ulcers\n- surgery is needed to repair the affected blood vessel\nBlood transfusions&nbsp;may also be needed to replace the blood you&#8217;ve lost.\nPerforations are a rarer complication of stomach ulcers. This is when the lining of the stomach splits open.\nThis can be very serious because it lets the bacteria that live in your stomach escape and infect the lining of your abdomen (peritoneum). This is known as peritonitis.\nIn peritonitis, an infection can rapidly spread into the blood (sepsis) before spreading to other organs. This carries the risk of multiple organ failure&nbsp;and can be fatal if left untreated.\nThe most common symptom of peritonitis is sudden abdominal pain, which gets steadily worse. If you have this type of pain, contact your GP or the NHS 24 111 service immediately.\nPeritonitis is a medical emergency that requires hospital admission. In some cases, surgery may be needed.\nIn some cases, an inflamed (swollen) or scarred stomach ulcer can obstruct the normal passage of food through your digestive system. This is called a gastric outlet obstruction.\nSymptoms include:\n- vomiting large amounts of undigested food\n- a constant feeling of bloating or fullness\n- feeling more full than usual after eating less food\n- unexplained weight loss\nAn endoscopy can be used to confirm the obstruction.\nIf the obstruction&#8217;s caused by inflammation, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or H2-receptor antagonists can be used to reduce stomach acid levels until the swelling goes down.\nIf the obstruction&#8217;s caused by scar tissue, surgery may be needed. This can involve passing a small balloon through an endoscope and inflating it to widen the site of the obstruction."

        "disease": "Streptococcus A (strep A)",
        "description": "Group A Streptococcus (GAS), also known as Strep A, are bacteria commonly found on the skin or in the throat. Under some circumstances these bacteria can cause disease.\nGAS infection commonly presents as a mild sore throat (&#8216;strep throat&#8217;) and skin/soft tissue infections such as impetigo and cellulitis.\nIf your GP is closed, phone the 111 service.\nIf you feel that you or your child is seriously unwell, trust your own judgement and seek medical assistance.\nStrep A tests are not available through the NHS in Scotland for self-testing at home. Should you or your child need to be tested for Strep A, your GP or other healthcare professional will advise you.\nGAS bacteria can cause a wide variety of skin, soft tissue and respiratory tract infections ranging in severity from mild to life-threatening. These include:\n- tonsillitis\n- sore throat\n- scarlet fever\n- impetigo\n- erysipelas (a type of cellulitis)\n- cellulitis\n- pneumonia\nIn rare cases, patients may go on to develop post-streptococcal complications, such as:\n- rheumatic fever\n- glomerulonephritis (heart and kidney diseases caused by an immune reaction to the bacteria)​\nGAS can very rarely cause more serious conditions, known as invasive group A Streptococcus (iGAS) infections. These can include:\n- bacteraemia (an infection of the bloodstream)\n- septic arthritis\n- meningitis\n- necrotising fasciitis (a severe infection involving death of areas of soft tissue below the skin)\n- Streptococcal&nbsp;toxic shock syndrome&nbsp;(rapidly progressive symptoms with low blood pressure and multi-organ failure)\niGAS infections tend to happen in the elderly, the very young, or people with an underlying risk factor with groups considered to be at risk of serious GAS infection being:\n- people with existing health conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or a weakened immune system\n- people who have recently had flu or chickenpox\n- newborn babies\n- women who are pregnant or have recently given birth\n- people who are homeless or inject drugs\nMost GAS infections are relatively mild illnesses that clear up on their own without the need for antibiotics.\nOften symptoms that look like GAS infections, like&nbsp;sore throats, are more commonly caused by viruses than GAS bacteria. If you or your child has a runny nose with their sore throat, it&#8217;s likely to be a virus infection. Sore throats caused by viruses do not need to be treated with antibiotics unless there are concerns about complications.\nMore about sore throat symptoms, self-care at home, and what to do if your condition worsens&nbsp;\nYour healthcare professional will consider antibiotics if they think:\n- you or your child need medication to get better or to ease symptoms\n- you or your child are at risk of serious complications from a GAS infection\n- you or your child has&nbsp;scarlet fever\nIf you or your child is prescribed antibiotics, they could be in liquid or pill form.\nIt&#8217;s not uncommon for someone to have GAS bacteria on their skin or in their throat without being unwell. These people often don&#8217;t know they have the bacteria and won&#8217;t need antibiotics.\nGAS are spread by close contact between individuals, through respiratory droplets (moisture in your breath) and direct skin contact.\nTo help reduce the risk of picking up or spreading infections:\nGAS can be a secondary infection, developing in people who are already unwell with illnesses like the flu. You can help protect your child from this risk by making sure they get their free&nbsp;flu vaccine&nbsp;this winter.\nNew evidence&nbsp;also shows that the nasal spray flu vaccine offered to children may also protect them from GAS infection.&nbsp;"

        "disease": "Stroke",
        "description": "A stroke is a serious, life-threatening medical condition. It happens when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off.\nStrokes are a medical emergency and urgent treatment is essential. The sooner a person receives treatment for a stroke, the less damage to the brain is likely to occur.\nEven if the symptoms of a stroke go away, you or the person having a stroke should still go to hospital for an assessment.\nDo not drive if you suspect you&#8217;ve had a stroke or TIA (transient ischaemic attack).\nThe main symptoms of stroke can be remembered with the word FAST. FAST stands for:\n- Face – the face might drop on one side, the person may not be able to smile or their mouth may have dropped, and their eyelid may droop\n- Arms – the person may not be able to lift both arms and keep them there because of arm weakness or numbness in one arm\n- Speech – they might slur their speech or it might be garbled, or the person may not be able to talk at all despite appearing to be awake\n- Time – it’s time to&nbsp;phone 999 immediately if you see any of these signs or symptoms\nA person having a stroke might not have all of these symptoms. If you notice any of these symptoms, you should consider a person may be having a stroke.\nSymptoms in the FAST test identify most strokes. Occasionally a stroke can cause different symptoms which might include:\n- complete paralysis of one side of the body\n- sudden loss or blurring of vision\n- difficulty understanding what others are saying\n- problems with balance and co-ordination\n- a sudden and very severe headache\n- loss of feeling in one side of the body\nHowever, there are&nbsp;sometimes other causes for these symptoms.\nLike all organs, the brain needs the oxygen and nutrients provided by blood to function. If the supply of blood is restricted or stopped, brain cells begin to die. This can lead to brain injury, disability and possibly death.\nThere are 2 main causes of strokes:\n- ischaemic – where the blood supply is stopped due to a blood clot (this accounts for 85% of all cases)\n- haemorrhagic – where a weakened blood vessel supplying the brain bursts\nThere’s also a related condition known as a transient ischaemic attack (TIA).\nThe symptoms of a TIA are the same as a stroke, but they only last between a few minutes and a few hours before disappearing completely.\nAlthough the symptoms do improve, you should never ignore a TIA. A TIA is a serious warning sign there’s a problem with the blood supply to your brain. This means you’re at an increased risk of having a stroke in the near future.\nRead more about TIA\nIf your GP practice is closed, phone 111.\nThere are some things that can make you more likely to have a stroke or TIA:\n- poor diet\n- lack of exercise\n- obesity\n- smoking\n- drinking too much alcohol\n- high cholesterol\n- high blood pressure (hypertension)\n- diabetes\n- atrial fibrillation\nLifestyle changes can help control some of these risk factors. You may also need to take regular medication. Taking anticoagulant medication if you have an irregular heartbeat due to atrial fibrillation will help reduce the risk of stroke.\nIf you&#8217;ve had a stroke or TIA, these measures are very important because you&#8217;re at a higher risk of having another stroke.\nIn most cases it&#8217;s possible to significantly reduce your risk of having a stroke by making lifestyle changes like:\n- eating a healthy diet –&nbsp;a low-fat, low-salt, high-fibre diet is usually recommended, with plenty of fresh fruit, vegetables and whole grains\n- exercising regularly – this can help lower your cholesterol level and keep your blood pressure at a healthy level\n- stopping smoking if you smoke\n- cutting down on the amount of alcohol&nbsp;you drink\nThere are some risk factors you can&#8217;t change like:\n- age – people over 65 are most at risk of having strokes, although they can happen at any age – including in children\n- family history – if a close relative (parent, grandparent, brother or sister) has had a stroke, your risk is likely to be higher\n- ethnicity – if you’re south Asian, African or Caribbean, your risk of stroke is higher, partly because rates of diabetes and high blood pressure are higher in these groups\n- your medical history – if you’ve had a stroke, transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or heart attack, your risk of stroke is higher\nStrokes are usually diagnosed by physical tests and studying scans of the brain.\nSome tests can help confirm the diagnosis and determine the cause of the stroke. This may include:\n- checking your pulse for an irregular heartbeat\n- measuring your blood pressure\n- blood tests to check your cholesterol and blood sugar levels\nEven if the physical symptoms of a stroke are obvious, you should have a brain scan to determine:\n- if a blocked artery (ischaemic stroke) or burst blood vessel (haemorrhagic stroke) caused the stroke\n- which part of the brain is affected\n- how severe the stroke is\nEveryone with suspected stroke should receive a brain scan as soon as possible when they attend hospital. This is especially important for those who:\n- might benefit from treatments to unblock arteries like clot-busting drugs (thrombolysis) like alteplase or a procedure to unblock blood vessels (thrombectomy)\n- are on anticoagulant (blood thinning) treatments\n- have a lower level of consciousness\nThis is why a stroke is a medical emergency and you should phone 999 if you think someone is having a stroke.\nThe 2 main types of scan used to assess the brain in people who have had a suspected stroke are:\n- computerised tomography (CT) scan\n- magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan\nThe type of scan you may have depends on your symptoms.\nThere may be further tests on the heart and blood vessels to confirm what caused your stroke.\nAn electrocardiogram (ECG) measures your heart’s electrical activity. It does this by using electrodes (small, sticky patches) on your skin.\nAn ECG can detect abnormal heart rhythms. This can be a sign of conditions like atrial fibrillation (where your heart beats irregularly). Atrial fibrillation can increase your risk of stroke and TIAs.\nAnother type of ultrasound scan is called an echocardiogram. This type of scan can produce images of your heart. This involves having an ultrasound probe moved across your chest (transthoracic echocardiogram) or occasionally down your gullet (oesophagus).\nWhile you&#8217;re in a stroke unit, the team may put a heart monitor on you to look for abnormal heart rhythms like atrial fibrillation.\nThis may be done again after you go home by having you wear a small device attached to your skin for at least 3 days.\nA carotid ultrasound scan can help show if there&#8217;s any narrowing or blockages in the neck arteries leading to your brain.\nAn ultrasound scan involves using a small probe (transducer) to send high-frequency sound waves into your body. When these sound waves bounce back, they can create an image of the inside of your body.\nEffective treatment of stroke can reduce the risk of long-term disability and save lives.\nTreatment of stroke has 2 main purposes:\nThe first is the immediate treatment in the first few hours of a stroke to minimise the damage to the brain and reduce long term effects. This is why its important to get urgent help, by phoning 999 or going to A&amp;E, for someone you think is having a stroke.\nTreatment is then started to reduce the risk of further strokes and to reduce the risk of complications from a stroke.\nThe specific treatments recommended depend on whether a stroke is caused by:\n- a blood clot obstructing the flow of blood to the brain (ischaemic stroke)\n- a burst blood vessel bleeding in or around the brain (haemorrhagic stroke)\nTreatment usually involves taking one or more different medications. Some people may also need surgery. It’s important to seek treatment as soon as possible to improve the chances of a good recovery.\nIf you’ve had an ischaemic stroke, you may benefit from emergency treatments, like thrombolysis or thrombectomy, to reduce the amount of brain damage.\nAfter an ischaemic stroke, the aim is to reduce the risk of another stroke especially in the first few days. To do this a combination of treatments is usually recommended. Some of the treatments might include:\n- antiplatelets\n- anticoagulants\n- antihypertensives&nbsp;\n- statins\nSome of these medications need to be taken immediately and only for a short time. Others may only be started once the stroke has been treated and may need to be taken long term.\nYou might also benefit from a carotid endarterectomy which is a surgical procedure to remove a narrowing in a blood vessel in the neck. This is to reduce the risk of a future stroke.\nSome people who’ve had a haemorrhagic stroke will be offered medication to reduce blood pressure immediately. However, most patients will be offered long-term treatments to lower blood pressure to reduce the risk of another stroke.\nIf you were taking anticoagulant medicine before you had your stroke, you may also need treatment to reverse the effects of the medication and reduce your risk of further bleeding. Once you&#8217;re past the acute phase of your stroke, your doctor may discuss the risks and benefits of restarting anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications.\nOccasionally, neurosurgery can be considered to treat a haemorrhagic stroke.\nA swallow test is essential for anybody who’s had any type of stroke, as swallowing ability is often affected after a stroke.\nWhen a person can’t swallow properly, food and drink may get into the windpipe and then into the lungs (aspiration). This can lead to chest infections such as pneumonia.\nFor the test, you’ll be given a few teaspoons of water to drink. If you can swallow this without choking and coughing you’ll be asked to swallow half a glass of water.\nIf you have any difficulty swallowing, you’ll be referred to the speech and language therapist for an assessment.\nYou might not be able to eat or drink until you’ve seen the therapist. This means you may need to have fluids or food given into a vein in your arm (intravenously) or through a feeding tube.\nYou may need further treatment to help manage some of the problems that can affect people who’ve had a stroke.\nYou might need:\n- a feeding tube inserted into your stomach through your nose (nasogastric tube) to provide nutrition if you have difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)\n- nutritional supplements if you’re malnourished\n- fluids given into a vein (intravenously) if you’re at risk of dehydration\n- oxygen through a nasal tube or face mask if you have low levels of oxygen in your blood\n- compression sleeves (intermittent pneumatic compression) to reduce the risk of blood clots in the leg (deep vein thrombosis)\nThe brain injury caused by a stroke can lead to long-lasting problems.\nSome people who’ve had a stroke need rehabilitation to help them regain as much independence as possible.\nRehabilitation often starts in hospital, at a local clinic and might continue at home. A team of specialists are available to help with your rehabilitation, including:\n- physiotherapists\n- speech and language therapists\n- occupational therapists\n- dietitians\n- psychologists\n- specialist nurses and doctors\nThese specialists might help you with:\nStrokes can cause weakness or paralysis in one side of the body. This can result in problems with co-ordination and balance.\nAs part of your rehabilitation, you should see a physiotherapist. They’ll assess the extent of any physical disability before deciding on treatment.\nPhysiotherapy often involves exercises to improve your muscle strength to overcome walking difficulties.\nYou might also get help from an occupational therapist. They’ll assess your ability to carry out everyday tasks. They can help adapt your home or suggest equipment to make tasks easier.\nAfter having a stroke, many people experience problems with language which can affect speaking, understanding, reading, and writing.\nThis is known as aphasia, or dysphasia, when it’s caused by injury to the parts of the brain responsible for language.\nIf the muscles involved in speech are affected this can cause slurring (dysarthria).\nYou should see a speech and language therapist for an assessment, and to start therapy for your communication.\nRead more about aphasia\nThe damage caused by a stroke can interrupt your normal swallowing reflex (dysphagia). This makes it possible for small particles of food to enter your windpipe.\nDysphagia can lead to damage to your lungs, which can trigger a lung infection (pneumonia).\nYou may need to be fed using a feeding tube during the initial phases of your recovery to reduce the risk of any complications from dysphagia.\nYou’ll usually see a speech and language therapist for treatment to manage swallowing problems.\nRead more about dysphagia\nStrokes can also affect the control of the movement of the eye muscles. This can cause double vision. Strokes which damage the nerves affecting your sight can cause loss of vision in one, or more often, both eyes.\nIf you have any problems with your vision after a stroke, you’ll be referred to an orthoptist (eye specialist). They can assess your vision and suggest possible treatments.\nSome strokes damage the part of the brain that controls bladder and bowel movements.\nThis can result in urinary incontinence and difficulty with bowel control.\nSome people who’ve had a stroke may regain bladder and bowel control quite quickly. If you still have problems after leaving hospital, help is available from your GP and specialist continence advisors.\nThere are lots of treatments that can help including:\n- bladder retraining exercises\n- medications\n- pelvic floor exercises\n- the use of incontinence products\nRead more about treating urinary incontinence\nA stroke might disrupt the way your brain works (cognitive functions) like:\n- communication – both speaking and written\n- spatial awareness – having an awareness of where your body is in relation to what’s around you\n- memory\n- concentration\n- executive function – the ability to plan, solve problems, and reason about situations\n- praxis – the ability to do physical activities, like getting dressed or making a cup of tea\nMost cognitive functions will improve after time and rehabilitation, but you might find they do not return to how they were before.\nThe damage that a stroke causes to your brain also increases the risk of developing vascular dementia.\nYou might experience extreme tiredness (fatigue) after a stroke. This can last months or even years. You might have difficulty sleeping, making you even more tired.\nTwo common psychological problems that can affect people after a stroke are depression and anxiety. Feelings of anger, frustration and bewilderment are also common. Some people experience periods of laughter or crying which is difficult to control.\nYou’ll receive a psychological assessment from a member of your healthcare team.\nFor some people, medicines and psychological therapies, such as counselling or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can help.\nHaving sex will not put you at a higher risk of having a stroke. Even if you have a severe disability, you can find new ways of being intimate with your partner.\nSome medications can reduce your sex drive (libido). Tell your doctor if you have a problem, as there may be other medicines that can help.\nSome men may experience erectile dysfunction. Speak to your GP or rehabilitation team if this is the case, as there are treatments available that can help.\nRead more about treating erectile dysfunction\nIf you’ve had a stroke or TIA, you can’t drive for one month. Whether you can return to driving depends on what long-term disabilities you have and the type of vehicle you drive.\nYour GP can tell you whether you can start driving again a month after your stroke or if you need a specialist assessment.\nAround half the people who have a stroke will need some form of care or help with their daily activities. For example, a care worker could come to the person’s home to help with household tasks, or to provide companionship.\nThere are lots of ways you can support a friend or relative who’s had a stroke to speed up their rehabilitation.\nCaring for somebody after a stroke can be a frustrating and lonely experience. Be prepared for changed behaviour. Someone who’s had a stroke can often seem as though they’ve had a change in personality and appear to act irrationally because of the psychological and cognitive impact of a stroke.\nTry to remain patient and positive. Rehabilitation can be a slow and frustrating process. Encouraging and praising any progress, can help motivate someone who has had a stroke to achieve their long-term goals.\nMake time for yourself. If you’re caring for someone who has had a stroke, it’s important not to neglect your own physical and psychological wellbeing.\nAsk for help. There are a wide range of support services and resources available for people recovering from strokes, and their families and carers.\nRead more about care services in your home on Care Information Scotland."

        "disease": "Subacromial pain syndrome",
        "description": "This information is useful for those who have been diagnosed with subacromial pain syndrome. People who are experiencing new or ongoing symptoms should contact their healthcare professional.\nRead more about self-managing a shoulder problem\nSubacromial pain syndrome is a general term used to describe pain which originates from the shoulder and can spread towards the neck or down the arm. It&#8217;s the most common reason for shoulder pain.\nThe shoulder joint is the most mobile joint in the body. It&#8217;s a ball and socket joint which enables a very wide range of movement supported by the rotator cuff muscles and tendons. Often, with this condition, these tendons can be weakened.\nSubacromial pain syndrome can develop due to:\n- age related changes\n- repetitive strain\n- injury or trauma\nHowever, this condition can sometimes appear without any apparent reason.\nOther factors that can affect tendon health&nbsp;include:\n- smoking&nbsp;\n- obesity&nbsp;\n- high fat diet &nbsp;\n- high cholesterol levels &nbsp;\n- diabetes (Type 1 and 2)&nbsp;\nThe main symptom is pain in the upper arm caused by specific movements or activities. These are usually activities that involve lifting the arm above shoulder level and reaching behind the back, for example when putting a jacket on.\nIt may be difficult to lie on the affected shoulder which can disturb your sleep.\nIn order for subacromial pain syndrome to be diagnosed you&#8217;ll need an assessment from a healthcare professional.\nThey&#8217;ll initially ask you questions about your shoulder issue and then carry out a physical examination.

        "description": "Sunburn is skin damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) rays. It usually causes the skin to become red, sore, warm, tender and occasionally itchy for about a week.\nThe skin will normally start to flake and peel after a few days and will usually fully heal within 7 days.\nWhile sunburn is often short-lived and mild, it&#8217;s important to&nbsp;try&nbsp;to avoid it, because it can increase your chances of developing serious health problems, such as skin cancer, in later life.\nIt’s easy to underestimate your exposure to the sun when outside, as the redness doesn’t usually develop for several hours. Breezes and getting wet (such as going in and out of the sea) may cool your skin, so you don’t realise you’re getting burnt.\nYou should always be aware of the risk of sunburn if you’re outside in strong sun, and look out for your skin getting hot.\nIf you or your child has sunburn, you should get out of the sun as soon as possible – head indoors or into a shady area.\nYou can usually treat mild sunburn at home, although there are some circumstances where you should seek medical advice.\nThe following advice may help to relieve your symptoms until your skin heals.\nYour nearest pharmacist can advise you on the best treatment if you have sunburn.\nYou have sunburn and feel unwell or have any concerns about your sunburn, particularly if you&#8217;re burnt over a large area or have any of the more severe symptoms&nbsp;such as:\nYou should also see your GP if a young child or baby has sunburn, as their skin is particularly fragile.\nIf your GP practice is closed, phone 111.\nYour GP may recommend using hydrocortisone cream for a few days (this is also available over the counter at pharmacies) to reduce the inflammation of your skin.\nSevere sunburn may require special burn cream and burn dressings from your GP or a nurse at your GP practice. Very occasionally, hospital treatment may be needed.\nEveryone who is exposed to UV light is at risk of getting sunburn, although some people are more vulnerable than others.\nYou should take extra care when out in the sun if you:\n- have pale, white or light brown skin\n- have freckles or red or fair hair\n- tend to burn rather than tan\n- have many moles\n- have skin problems relating to a medical condition\n- are only exposed to intense sun occasionally – for example, while on holiday\n- are in a hot country where the sun is particularly intense\n- have a family history of skin cancer\nPeople who spend a lot of time in the sun, whether it’s for work or play, are at increased risk of skin cancer if they don’t take the right precautions.\nSnow, sand, concrete and water can reflect the sun’s rays onto your skin, and the sun is more intense at high altitudes.&nbsp;\nThe short-term risks of sun exposure are sunburn and sun&nbsp;allergy.\nThe longer-term risks (over decades) include:\n- actinic (solar) keratoses&nbsp;– rough and scaly pre-cancerous spots on the skin\n- skin cancer – including both&nbsp;melanoma&nbsp;and&nbsp;non-melanoma skin cancer\n- eye problems – such as photokeratitis (snow blindness) and&nbsp;cataracts\n- premature ageing of the skin and wrinkling\nSkin should be protected from strong sunlight by covering up with suitable clothing, seeking shade and applying sunscreen.\nIn the UK, the risk of getting sunburnt is highest from March to October, particularly from 11am to 3pm, when the sun&#8217;s rays are strongest.\nThere is also a risk of getting sunburn in other weather conditions. For example, light reflecting off snow can also cause sunburn. You can also burn in cloudy and cool conditions.\nSuitable clothing includes:\n- a wide-brimmed hat that shades the face, neck and ears\n- a long-sleeved top\n- trousers or long skirts in close-weave fabrics that do not allow sunlight through\n- sunglasses with wraparound lenses or wide arms with the CE Mark and European Standard EN 1836:2005.\nWhen buying sunscreen, make sure it&#8217;s suitable for your skin&nbsp;and blocks both ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation.\nThe sunscreen label should have:\n- the letters &#8216;UVA&#8217; in a circle logo and at least 4-star UVA protection\n- at least SPF30 sunscreen to protect against UVB\nMost people do not apply enough sunscreen. The amount of sunscreen needed for the body of an average adult to achieve the stated sun protection factor (SPF) is around 35ml or 6 to 8 teaspoons of lotion.&nbsp;\nIf sunscreen is applied too thinly, it provides less protection. If you’re worried you might not be applying enough SPF30, you could use a stronger SPF50 sunscreen.\nIf you plan to be out in the sun long enough to risk burning, sunscreen needs to be applied twice:\n- 30 minutes before going out\n- just before you go out\nSunscreen should be applied to all exposed skin, including the face, neck and ears (and head if you have thinning or no hair), but a wide-brimmed hat is better.\nHow long it takes for your skin to go red or burn varies from person to person. The Cancer Research UK website has a handy tool where you can find out your skin type, to see when you might be at risk of burning.\nWater-resistant sunscreen is needed if sweating or contact with water is likely.\nSunscreen needs to be reapplied liberally, frequently and according to the manufacturer’s instructions. This includes straight after you&#8217;ve been in water (even if it is &#8216;water-resistant&#8217;) and after towel drying, sweating or when it may have rubbed off.\nChildren aged under 6 months should be kept out of direct strong sunlight.\nFrom March to October in the UK, children should:\n- cover up with suitable clothing\n- spend time in the shade (particularly from 11am to 3pm)\n- wear at least SPF30 sunscreen\nTo ensure they get enough vitamin D, children aged under 5 are advised to take vitamin D supplements even if they do get out in the sun.&nbsp;"

        "disease": "Supraventricular tachycardia",
        "description": "Supraventricular tachycardia is a condition where the heartbeat is abnormally fast.\nIt can happen to anyone at any age and often occurs for the first time in children or young adults.\nIn most cases, supraventricular tachycardia is harmless. It doesn&#8217;t usually last long and can settle without treatment.\nSome people are born with an abnormality of the heart’s natural ‘wiring’ or conduction system. This allows a short circuit to develop. Under certain circumstances, this allows the heart to race very fast.\nOne example of this is Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. This is where there&#8217;s an abnormal electrical connection between the:\n- atria (upper heart chambers), and\n- the ventricles (lower heart chambers)\nSome people with this condition can develop supraventricular tachycardias. This is because of this short circuit.\nIf you have supraventricular tachycardia, you&#8217;ll usually feel your heart racing in your chest or throat.\nThe heart rate is usually between 140 to 180 beats per minute but can be as high as 250. A normal heartbeat should be 60 to 100 beats per minute at rest.\nDuring a supraventricular tachycardia, the heart muscle contracts very fast. This means that it cannot relax properly between contractions to fill with blood. This reduces the amount of blood being pumped around the body.\nTherefore, you may also feel:\n- chest pain\n- dizziness\n- light-headedness\n- fatigue (tiredness)\n- breathlessness\nOn rare occasions, you may faint because of a drop in blood pressure.\nThese symptoms vary in length and frequency.\nIf your doctor thinks that you might have supraventricular tachycardia, you&#8217;ll be referred for tests. These can include an:\n- electrocardiogram (ECG)\n- ambulatory heart monitor\n- echocardiogram\nCommon causes of supraventricular tachycardia in people at risk of the condition include:\n- stress\n- anxiety\n- a change in posture\n- some medications\n- alcohol\n- caffeine\n- smoking\n- recreational drugs\nThe treatment for supraventricular tachycardia varies from person to person. It depends on:\n- the type of supraventricular tachycardia you have\n- your symptoms\n- treatment of any underlying cause\n- your age\n- your overall health\nSupraventricular tachycardia treatments focus on controlling the rate and rhythm of the heart. They include:\n- medication, like&nbsp;beta blockers&nbsp;and other anti-arrhythmic drugs\n- electric shock treatment (DC cardioversion) in an urgent case\n- radiofrequency ablation"

You may feel them:\n- on each side of the neck\n- under the chin\n- in the armpits\n- around the groin\nSwollen glands are usually caused by a viral or bacterial infection like:\n- a cold\n- tonsillitis\n- glandular fever\n- a throat infection\n- an ear infection\n- a dental abscess\n- cellulitis (a skin infection)\nThe glands in the affected area will often become suddenly tender or painful. You may also have other symptoms like a sore throat, cough, or fever.\nThese infections usually clear up on their own and the swollen glands will soon go down.\nSwollen lymph glands are rarely caused by anything more serious.\nWhen an infection causes swollen glands you can help to ease symptoms at home."

It&#8217;s hard to detect and is one of the most easily caught sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\nMost people with syphilis don&#8217;t notice any symptoms and don&#8217;t know they have it. Symptoms change over time and may come and go.\nSyphilis usually has 3 stages.\nTen days to 3 months after infection, you may notice a small, painless sore or ulcer.\nThis is typically on either the:\n- penis\n- vagina\n- anus\n- rectum\n- tongue\n- lips\nYou might only have 1 sore, but can have more.\nSwelling in your lymph glands (such as in the neck, groin or armpit) often happens with the ulcers.\nThe sore will then disappear within 2 to 6 weeks. If left untreated, syphilis will move into its second stage.\nSymptoms of secondary syphilis begin a few weeks after the original sore disappears.\nCommon symptoms of secondary syphilis include:\n- a non-itchy skin rash appearing anywhere on the body, but commonly on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet\n- tiredness\n- headaches\n- swollen lymph glands\nLess common symptoms include:\n- fever\n- weight loss\n- patchy hair loss\n- joint pains\nThese symptoms may disappear within a few weeks, or come and go for a few months.\nSyphilis will then move into a stage where you will experience no symptoms. You&#8217;re still infected during this stage. This is called ‘latent syphilis’. You can still pass it on during the first year of this stage. After a couple of years, you can&#8217;t pass the infection to others, even though you remain infected. However, during this stage, the infection can be passed on from a mother to an unborn child during pregnancy.\nThe latent stage can continue for many years (even decades) after you first become infected. Without treatment, there is a risk that latent syphilis will move on to the more serious stage –tertiary syphilis.\nThe symptoms of tertiary syphilis can begin years or even decades after the initial infection. 1 in 3 people who are not treated for syphilis develop serious symptoms eventually.\nThe symptoms of tertiary syphilis will depend on what part of the body the infection spreads to. For example, it may affect the brain, nerves, eyes, heart, bones, skin or blood vessels, potentially causing any of the following symptoms:\n- stroke\n- dementia\n- loss of co-ordination\n- numbness\n- paralysis\n- blindness\n- deafness\n- heart disease\n- skin rashes\nAt this stage, syphilis can be dangerous enough to cause death.\nIf you think you might have syphilis, get tested for free by:\n- booking an appointment at your local sexual health service\n- contacting your GP practice for an appointment\nThe only reliable way to tell if you have syphilis or not is to have a blood test. This is usually sent to the lab for analysis. However, in some sexual health services, a same day test can be done if you have symptoms.\nAntibiotics will treat the syphilis infection, even during pregnancy. These are given by injection, tablets or capsules.\nTreatment may be started before your test result is known. You may be given one or more doses, depending on the stage of infection.\nYou&#8217;ll need to go back to your GP practice or sexual health clinic 6 and 12 weeks after starting treatment to be retested.\nYou should avoid having sex until you and your partner (s) have finished treatment and your tests have shown treatment has worked. This includes oral sex and sex using a condom.\nYour partner should also get tested for syphilis. It can be hard to spot in its early stages and they might not realise they have it. They will generally be offered treatment regardless.\nIn Scotland, pregnant women are tested for syphilis as part of their antenatal checks.\nIf you&#8217;re pregnant and have syphilis, you can pass it on to your baby before they&#8217;re born. This is known as congenital syphilis.\nHaving syphilis during pregnancy can increase the risk of:\n- miscarriage\n- premature birth\n- stillbirth\nYou can get syphilis by having unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex (sex without a condom). Around one third of all people who get syphilis do so through having unprotected oral sex with no other vaginal or anal sex involved. It can also be passed by coming into contact with an ulcer on your partners penis, vagina, anus or inside their mouth.\nSyphilis can be passed on:\n- to an unborn baby during pregnancy (congenital syphilis)\n- by injecting drugs with a needle that&#8217;s been used by someone who has syphilis\n- during a blood or organ transplant (this is extremely rare as all blood and organ donations in the UK are checked for syphilis)\nSyphilis also makes HIV easier to pass on and catch.\nThe number of people getting syphilis in Scotland has greatly increased over the last 5 years. You could be at higher risk if you:\n- are a man who has sex with men\n- have had sex overseas\n- have had multiple sexual partners\nThe best way to reduce your risk of STIs is to practice safer sex. This means using a condom for vaginal, anal and oral sex.\nIf you have been diagnosed with syphilis you should get tested for all STIs including:\n- HIV\n- chlamydia\n- gonorrhoea"

        "disease": "Self-harm",
        "description": "Self-harm is when somebody intentionally damages or injures their body. It is a way of expressing deep emotional feelings such as low self-esteem, or a way of coping with traumatic events, such as the death of a loved one.\nIf you are self-harming, you should see your GP for help. You can also contact Breathing Space or call the Samaritans on 116 123 for support.\nRead more about where to get help if you self-harm\nSelf-harm is an expression of personal distress, rather than an illness, although it can be linked to other mental health conditions such as depression.\nRead more about the causes of self-harm\nResearch has suggested that self-harm is most common among 15-19 year&nbsp;olds, and those suffering from anxiety and depression.\nTypes of self-harm may include:\n- cutting the skin\n- burning the skin\n- punching your own body\n- poisoning yourself with tablets\n- misusing alcohol or drugs\n- eating disorders, such as deliberately starving yourself (anorexia nervosa), binge eating or bulimia\nPeople often try to keep self-harm a secret because of shame or fear of discovery. For example, they may cover up their skin and avoid discussing the problem. It may, therefore, be up to close family and friends to notice when somebody is self-harming, and to approach the subject with care and understanding. The signs may include unexplained injuries and signs of depression or low-self esteem.\nRead more about the signs of self-harm\nSomeone who is self-harming can seriously hurt themselves, so it is important that they speak to a GP about the underlying issue and about any treatment or therapy that might help them.\nThere are many different forms of self-harm and they are not always easy to notice.\nPeople who self-harm usually try to keep it a secret from their friends and family and often injure themselves in places that can be hidden easily by clothing.\nIf you suspect that a friend or relative is self-harming, look out for any of the following signs:\n- unexplained cuts, bruises or cigarette burns, usually on their wrists, arms, thighs and chest\n- keeping themselves fully covered at all times, even in hot weather\n- signs of depression, such as low mood, tearfulness or a lack of motivation or interest in anything\n- changes in eating habits or being secretive about eating, and any unusual weight loss or weight gain\n- signs of low self-esteem, such as blaming themselves for any problems or thinking they are not good enough for something\n- signs they have been pulling out their hair\n- signs of alcohol or drug misuse\nThe person who is self-harming may feel deep shame and guilt, or may feel confused and worried by their own behaviour. It’s important to approach them with care and understanding.\nThey may not wish to discuss their self-harm with you, but you could suggest that they speak to an anonymous helpline or see their GP.\nThere are many reasons why people self-harm, but the causes usually stem from unhappy emotions.\nSelf-harming has been described as a &#8220;physical expression of emotional distress&#8221;. If somebody is feeling overwhelmed with unhappy emotions, they may find that the physical act of hurting themselves makes them feel better.\nIf you are feeling like this, you can speak to your GP, contact Breathing Space or call the Samaritans on 116 123 for support.\nResearch has shown that social factors commonly cause emotional distress in people who self-harm. These include:\n- difficult relationships with friends or partners\n- difficulties at school, such as not doing well academically\n- difficulties at work\n- being bullied, either at home, school or work\n- worries about money\n- alcohol or drug misuse\n- coming to terms with your sexuality if you think you might be gay or bisexual\n- coping with cultural expectations, for example, an arranged marriage\nSelf-harm could also sometimes be a way of coping with a traumatic experience. For example:\n- sexual, physical or emotional abuse, including domestic abuse and rape\n- the death of a close family member or friend\n- having a miscarriage\nThe distress from a traumatic experience or an unhappy situation can lead to feelings of low self-esteem or self-hatred. You could also have feelings of:\n- anger\n- guilt\n- anxiety\n- loneliness\n- grief\n- numbness or emptiness\n- feeling unconnected to the world\n- being unclean, unworthy, trapped or silenced if you have been abused\nThe emotions can gradually build up inside you, and you may not know who to turn to for help. Self-harm may be a way of releasing these pent-up feelings and finding a way to cope with your problems. It is not usually an attempt to seek attention, but a sign of emotional distress.\nSome research has suggested that people who self-harm may have difficulty managing or &#8220;regulating&#8221; their emotions. They use self-harm as a way of managing tension and anger. Research has also shown that people who self-harm are poorer at problem solving.\nSelf-harm is linked to anxiety and depression. These mental health conditions can affect people of any age. Self-harm can also occur alongside antisocial behaviour, such as misbehaving at school or getting into trouble with the police.\nIn some cases there may be a psychological reason for the self-harming (where the cause is related to an issue with your mind). For example:\n- you may hear voices telling you to self-harm\n- you may have repeated thoughts about self-harming and feel like you have to do it\n- you may disassociate (lose touch with yourself and your surroundings) and self-harm without realising you are doing it\n- it can be a symptom of borderline personality disorder (a condition that causes instability in how a person thinks, feels and behaves)\nIt is important for anyone who self-harms to see their GP, who will aim to treat the underlying emotional cause as well as any physical injury.\nYour GP is likely to ask you about your feelings in some detail. They will want to establish why you self-harm, what triggers it and how you feel afterwards.\nYour GP may ask you some questions to see if you have an underlying condition such as depression, anxiety or borderline personality disorder. If the way you self-harm follows a particular pattern of behaviour, such as an eating disorder, you may be asked additional questions about this. Your height, weight and blood pressure may also be checked, and you may be asked about any drinking or drug-taking habits.\nIt is important that you are honest with your GP about your symptoms and your feelings. If you don’t know why you self-harm, tell your GP this.\nRecent research indicates that most teenagers who self-harm are able to give up this behaviour as they learn to manage feelings in healthier ways, for example, by talking to others.\nHowever, some young people who self-harm continue to do so into adulthood and if you fall into this category, your GP may refer you to a mental health professional. This could be:\n- a counsellor&nbsp;– somebody who is trained in talking therapies\n- a psychiatrist – a qualified medical doctor with further training in treating mental health conditions\n- a psychologist – a health professional who specialises in the assessment and treatment of mental health conditions\nFor example, if you have lost a close relative, you may be referred to a specialist grief counsellor for help coping with bereavement. If you are self-harming after an incident of rape, or physical or mental abuse, you may be referred to someone who is trained in dealing with victims of sexual assault or domestic abuse.\nIf you have another condition that is linked to your self-harming, such as anorexia nervosa or bulimia, you may be referred to a specialist in eating disorders and a dietitian or nutritionist (somebody who specialises in nutrition).\nIt might also be recommended that you attend a self-help group, for example, Alcoholics Anonymous if you are misusing alcohol, or Narcotics Anonymous if you are misusing drugs. These groups can offer support as you try to stop your self-harming behaviour.\nYou may be offered a psychosocial assessment, which aims to investigate all the factors that contribute to your self-harming, including:\n- social factors – for example, your relationships with others\n- psychological factors – your feelings and emotions\n- motivational factors – what made you want to do it\nYou will be asked about your current feelings, particularly if you are feeling hopeless or considering suicide. If you have any other symptoms, either physical or emotional, you will also be asked about these.\nAfter the assessment you will be allowed to read through what has been written to make sure that you agree with it. Any further treatment will, if possible, be decided jointly between you and your mental health professional. It will be a specific programme for you according to your needs and what is likely to be effective. You will be asked for your consent before any treatment begins.\nSome physical injuries may need treating in an accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department. For example, you may need to call 999 for an ambulance if:\n- you or somebody else have taken an overdose of drugs, alcohol or prescription medication\n- somebody is unconscious\n- you or somebody else are in a lot of pain\n- you or somebody else are having difficulty breathing\n- you or somebody else are losing a lot of blood from a cut or wound\n- you or somebody else are in shock after a serious cut or burn\nIf you would like to talk to somebody immediately about the way you are feeling, contact Breathing Space or call the Samaritans on 116 123."

It tends to mostly affect men and anyone with testicles between 15 and 49 years of age.\nThe most common symptom is a painless lump or swelling in one of the testicles. It can be the size of a pea or it may be much larger.\nOther symptoms can include:\n- a dull ache in the scrotum\n- a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum\nIt&#8217;s important to be aware of what feels&nbsp;normal for you. Get to know your body and speak to your GP if you notice any changes.\nRead more about&nbsp;the&nbsp;symptoms of testicular cancer&nbsp;and diagnosing testicular cancer.\nThe testicles are the 2 oval-shaped male sex organs that sit inside the scrotum on either side of the penis.\nThe testicles are an important part of the male reproductive system because they produce sperm and the hormone testosterone, which plays a major role in male sexual development.\nThe different types of testicular cancer are classified by the type of cells the&nbsp;cancer begins in.\nThe most common type of testicular cancer is &#8216;germ cell testicular cancer&#8217;, which accounts for around 95% of all cases. Germ cells are a type of cell that the body uses to create sperm.\nThere are 2 main subtypes of germ cell testicular cancer. They are:\n- seminomas&nbsp;– which have become more common in the last 20 years and now account for 50 to 55% of testicular cancers\n- non-seminomas&nbsp;–&nbsp;which account for most of the rest and include teratomas, embryonal carcinomas, choriocarcinomas and yolk sac tumours\nBoth types&nbsp;tend to respond well to chemotherapy.\nLess common types of testicular cancer include:\n- Leydig cell tumours&nbsp;– which account for around 1 to 3% of cases\n- Sertoli cell tumours&nbsp;– which account for around 1% of cases\n- lymphoma&nbsp;– which accounts for around 4% of cases\nThis topic focuses on germ cell testicular cancer.\nYou can contact the Macmillan Support Line for more information about Leydig cell tumour and Sertoli cell tumours. Their helpline number is 0808 808 00 00 and it&#8217;s open Monday to Friday, 8am to 8pm.\nRead more about&nbsp;Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nTesticular cancer is a relatively rare type of cancer.&nbsp;\nTesticular cancer is unusual compared to other cancers because it tends to affect younger men and anyone with testicles. Although it&#8217;s relatively uncommon overall, testicular cancer is the most common type of cancer to affect men and anyone with testicles between the ages of 15 and 49.\nFor reasons that are unclear,&nbsp;white men and anyone with testicles have a higher risk of developing testicular cancer compared with other ethnic groups.\nThe number of cases of testicular cancer that are diagnosed each year in the UK has roughly doubled since the mid-1970s. Again, the reasons for this are unclear.\nThe exact cause or causes of testicular cancer are unknown, but a number of factors have been identified that increase a man&#8217;s risk of developing it. The 3 main risk factors are described below.\nUndescended testicles&nbsp;(cryptorchidism) is the most significant risk factor for testicular cancer.\nAbout 3&nbsp;to 5% of boys are born with their testicles inside their abdomen. They usually descend into the scrotum during the first year of life, but in some boys the testicles don&#8217;t descend.&nbsp;\nIn most cases, testicles&nbsp;that don&#8217;t descend by the time a boy is 1 year old descend&nbsp;at a later stage. If the testicles don&#8217;t descend naturally,&nbsp;an operation known as an&nbsp;orchidopexy can be carried out to move the testicles into the correct position inside the scrotum.\nIt&#8217;s important that undescended testicles move down into the scrotum during early childhood because boys with undescended testicles have a higher risk of developing testicular cancer than boys&nbsp;whose testicles descend normally. It&#8217;s also much easier to observe the testicles when they&#8217;re in the scrotum.\nPeople with undescended testicles are about 3 times more likely to develop testicular cancer than those whose testicles descend at birth or shortly after.\nHaving a close relative with a history of testicular cancer or an undescended testicle increases your risk of also developing it.\nFor example, if your father had testicular cancer, you&#8217;re around 4 times more likely to develop&nbsp;it than someone with no family history of the condition. If your brother had testicular cancer, you&#8217;re about 8 times more likely to develop it.\nA number of genes may be involved&nbsp;in the development of testicular cancer&nbsp;in families where more than 1 person has had the condition. This is an ongoing area of research&nbsp;in which patients and their families may be asked to take part.\nPeople who&#8217;ve previously been diagnosed with testicular cancer are between 4 to 12 times more likely to develop it in the other testicle.\nFor this reason,&nbsp;if you&#8217;ve previously been diagnosed with testicular cancer, it&#8217;s very important that you keep a close eye on the other testicle.\nIf you&#8217;ve been diagnosed with testicular cancer, you also need to be observed for signs of recurrence for between 5 and 10 years, so it&#8217;s very important that you attend your follow-up appointments.\nCancer Research UK has more information about testicular cancer risks and causes.\nTesticular cancer is one of the most treatable types of cancer, and the outlook is one of the best for cancers.\nAlmost all men and anyone with testicles who are treated for testicular germ cell tumours are cured, and it&#8217;s rare for the condition to return more than 5 years later.\nTreatment almost always includes the surgical removal of the affected testicle – called orchidectomy or orchiectomy – which doesn&#8217;t usually affect fertility or the ability to have sex.\nIn some cases,&nbsp;chemotherapy or, less commonly,&nbsp;radiotherapy may be used for seminomas (but not non-seminomas).\nRead more about treating testicular cancer.\nThe most common symptom of testicular cancer is a lump or swelling in 1 of your testicles.\nThe lump or swelling can be about the size of a pea, but may be larger.\nMost lumps or swellings in the scrotum aren&#8217;t in the testicle and aren&#8217;t a sign of cancer. But they should never be ignored. Visit your GP as soon as you notice a lump or swelling in your scrotum.\nTesticular cancer can also cause other symptoms, including a:\n- dull ache or sharp pain in your testicles or scrotum, which may come and go\n- feeling of heaviness in your scrotum\n- change in the texture or increase in firmness of a testicle\n- difference between one testicle and the other\nSpeak to your GP as soon as you notice any lump or swelling on your testicle. They&#8217;ll examine your testicles to help determine whether or not the lump is cancerous.\nLumps within the scrotum can have many different causes and testicular cancer is rare. If your GP thinks the lump is in your testicle they may consider cancer as a possible cause.\nResearch has shown that less than 4% of scrotal lumps or swellings are cancerous. For example,&nbsp;varicoceles (swollen blood vessels) and epididymal cysts (cysts in the tubes around the testicle) are common causes of testicular lumps.\nIf you do have testicular cancer, the sooner treatment begins, the greater the likelihood that you&#8217;ll be completely cured.\nIf you don&#8217;t feel comfortable visiting your GP, you can go to your local sexual health clinic, where a healthcare professional will be able to examine you.\nIf testicular cancer has spread to other parts of your body, you may also experience other symptoms. Cancer that has spread to other parts of the body is known as metastatic cancer.\nAround 5% of people with testicular cancer will experience symptoms of metastatic cancer.\nThe most common place for testicular cancer to spread to is nearby lymph nodes in your abdomen or lungs. Lymph nodes are glands that make up your immune system. Less commonly, the cancer can spread to your liver, brain or bones.\nSymptoms of metastatic testicular cancer can include:\n- a persistent cough \n- coughing or spitting up blood&nbsp;\n- shortness of breath&nbsp;\n- swelling and enlargement of male breasts\n- a&nbsp;lump or swelling in your neck\n- lower&nbsp;back pain\nSpeak to your GP as soon as possible if you notice a lump or other abnormality in your scrotum that you think may be on one of your testicles.\nMost scrotal lumps aren&#8217;t cancerous, but if you have a lump that you think may be in one of your testicles it&#8217;s important you have it checked as soon as possible. Treatment for testicular cancer is much more effective when started&nbsp;early.\nAs well as asking you about your symptoms and looking at your medical history, your GP will usually need to examine your testicles.\nThey may hold a small light or torch against your scrotum to see whether light passes through it. Testicular lumps tend to be solid, which means light is unable to pass through them. A collection of fluid in the scrotum will allow light to pass through it.\nIf you have a non-painful lump, or a change in shape or texture of one&nbsp;of your testicles, and your&nbsp;GP thinks it may be cancerous, you&#8217;ll be referred for further testing within 2 weeks.\nA scrotal ultrasound scan is a painless procedure that uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your testicle. It&#8217;s one of the main ways of finding out whether or not a lump is cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign).\nDuring a scrotal ultrasound, your specialist will be able to determine the position and size of the abnormality in your testicle.\nIt will also give a clear indication of whether the lump is in the testicle or separate within the scrotum, and whether it&#8217;s solid or filled with fluid. A fluid-filled lump or collection around the testis&nbsp;is usually harmless. A more solid lump may be a sign the swelling is cancerous.\nTo help confirm a diagnosis, you may need a series of&nbsp;blood tests to detect certain hormones in your blood, known as &#8216;markers&#8217;.\nTesticular cancer often produces these markers, so if they&#8217;re in your blood it&nbsp;may indicate you have the condition.\nMarkers in your blood that will be tested for include:\n- AFP (alpha feta protein)\n- HCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin)\nA third blood test is also often carried out as it may indicate how active a cancer is. It&#8217;s called&nbsp;LDH (lactate dehydrogenate), but it isn&#8217;t a specific marker for&nbsp;testicular cancer.\nNot all people with testicular cancer produce markers. There may still be a chance you have testicular cancer even if your blood test results come back normal.\nThe only way to definitively confirm testicular cancer is to examine part of the lump under a microscope. These tests and reports are called histology.\nUnlike many cancers where a small piece of the cancer can be removed (a biopsy), in most cases the only way to examine a testicular lump is by removing the&nbsp;affected testicle completely.\nThis is because the combination of the ultrasound and blood marker tests is usually sufficient to make&nbsp;a firm diagnosis. Also, a biopsy may injure the testicle and spread cancer into the scrotum which isn&#8217;t usually affected.\nYour specialist will only recommend removing your testicle if they&#8217;re relatively certain the lump is cancerous. Losing a testicle won&#8217;t affect your sex life or ability to have children.\nThe removal of a testicle is called an orchidectomy. It&#8217;s the main type of treatment for testicular cancer, so if you have testicular cancer it&#8217;s likely you&#8217;ll need to have an orchidectomy.\nIn almost all cases, you&#8217;ll need further tests to check whether testicular cancer has spread. When cancer of the testicle spreads, it most commonly affects the lymph nodes in the back of the abdomen or the lungs.\nTherefore, you may require a chest&nbsp;X-ray&nbsp;to check for&nbsp;signs of a tumour. You&#8217;ll also need a scan of your entire body. This is usually a&nbsp;CT scan&nbsp;(computerised X-ray) to check for signs of the cancer spreading. In some cases, a different type of scan, known as a&nbsp;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan may be used.\nAfter all tests have been completed, it&#8217;s usually possible to determine the stage of&nbsp;your cancer.\nThere are 2 ways that testicular cancer can be staged. The first is known as the TNM staging system:\n- T – indicates the size of the tumour\n- N – indicates whether the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes\n- M – indicates whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body (metastasis)\nTesticular cancer is also staged numerically. The 4 main stages are:\n- stage 1 – the cancer is contained within your testicle and epididymis (the tube at the back of the testicle)\n- stage 2 – the cancer has spread from the testicles into the lymph nodes (small glands that help fight infection) at the back of the abdomen\n- stage 3 – the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes in the middle of the chest or in the neck&nbsp;\n- stage 4 – the cancer has spread to the lungs or, rarely, to other tissues or&nbsp;organs, such as the liver, bones or brain\nCancer Research UK has more information about testicular cancer stages.\nChemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery are the 3 main treatments for testicular cancer.\nYour recommended treatment plan will depend on:\n- the type of testicular cancer&nbsp;you have&nbsp;– whether it&#8217;s a&nbsp;seminoma or a non-seminoma\n- the stage&nbsp;of your testicular cancer\nThe first treatment option for all cases of testicular cancer, whatever the stage, is to surgically remove the affected testicle (an orchidectomy).\nFor stage 1 seminomas, after the testicle has been removed, a single dose of chemotherapy&nbsp;may be given to help prevent the cancer returning. A short course of radiotherapy is also sometimes recommended.\nHowever, in many cases, the chance of recurrence is low and your doctors may recommend that you&#8217;re very carefully monitored over the next few years. Further treatment is usually only needed for the small number of people who have a recurrence.\nFor&nbsp;stage 1 non-seminomas, close follow-up (called surveillance) may also be recommended, or a short course of chemotherapy using a combination of different medications.\nFor stage 2, 3 and 4 testicular cancers, 3 to 4 cycles of chemotherapy are given using a combination of different medications. Further surgery is sometimes needed after chemotherapy to remove any affected lymph nodes or deposits in the lungs or, rarely, in the liver.\nSome people with stage 2 seminomas may be suitable for less intense treatment with radiotherapy, sometimes with the addition of a simpler form of&nbsp;chemotherapy.\nIn non-seminoma germ cell tumours, additional surgery may also be required after chemotherapy to remove tumours from other parts of the body, depending on the extent of the spread of the tumour.\nDeciding what treatment is best for you can be difficult. Your cancer team will make recommendations, but the final decision will be yours.\nBefore discussing your treatment options with your&nbsp;specialist,&nbsp;you may find it useful to write a list of questions to ask them. For example, you may want to find out the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.\nAn orchidectomy is a surgical procedure to remove a testicle. If you have testicular cancer, the whole of the affected testicle will need to be removed because only removing the tumour may lead to the cancer spreading.\nBy removing the entire testicle, your chances of making a full recovery are greatly improved.&nbsp;Your sex life and&nbsp;ability to father children won&#8217;t be affected.\nAbout&nbsp;1 in 50 people will get a second new testicular cancer in their remaining testicle. In such circumstances, it&#8217;s&nbsp;sometimes possible to only remove the part of the testicle containing the tumour. You should ask your surgeon about this if you&#8217;re in this position.\nIf testicular cancer is detected in its very early stages, an orchidectomy may be the only treatment you require.\nAn orchidectomy isn&#8217;t carried out through the scrotum. It&#8217;s done by making an incision in your groin through which the testicle is&nbsp;removed with all of the tubes and blood vessels attached to the testicle that pass through the groin into the abdomen. The operation is carried out under general anaesthetic.&nbsp;\nYou can have an artificial (prosthetic) testicle inserted into your scrotum so that the appearance of your testicles isn&#8217;t greatly affected. The artificial testicle is usually made of silicone (a soft type of plastic).&nbsp;It probably won&#8217;t be exactly like your old testicle or the one you still have. It may be slightly different in size or texture.\nAfter&nbsp;an orchidectomy, it&#8217;s often possible to be discharged quickly, although you may need to stay in hospital for a few days. If only 1 testicle is removed, there shouldn&#8217;t be any lasting side effects.\nIf both testicles are removed (a bi-lateral orchidectomy), you&#8217;ll be infertile. However, removing both testicles at the same time is very rarely required, and only 1 in every 50 cases require the other testicle to be removed at a later date.\nYou may be able to bank your sperm before having a bi-lateral orchidectomy to allow you to father children if you decide to.\nMost people are still fertile after having 1 testicle removed. However, some treatments for testicular cancer can cause infertility.\nSome people with testicular cancer may have low sperm counts because of changes that occur in the testicles before the cancer develops.\nFor some treatments, such as chemotherapy, infertility may occur, but standard chemotherapies have a less than 50% chance of causing infertility if the remaining testicle is normal.\nIn people who need to have post-chemotherapy removal of lumps at the back of the abdomen, known as retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND), the ability to ejaculate (eject sperm from the penis) may be affected, even though the remaining testicle can still produce sperm.\nBefore your treatment begins, you may want to consider sperm banking. This is where a sample of your sperm is frozen so that it can be used at a later date to impregnate your partner during artificial insemination. Before sperm banking, you may be asked to have tests for HIV,&nbsp;hepatitis B and&nbsp;hepatitis C.\nIf you&#8217;re having complex chemotherapy for stage 2 to 4 testicular cancer, you should always be offered sperm banking. Ask if you&#8217;re concerned about your fertility.\nNot all men are suitable for sperm banking. For the technique to work, the sperm has to be of a reasonably high quality. There may also be situations where it&#8217;s considered too dangerous to delay treatment for sperm banking to take place.\nMost&nbsp;NHS cancer treatment centres offer a free sperm banking service. However, it&#8217;s up to each area of the country to decide whether they store sperm for free or whether you have to pay.\nCancer Research UK has more information about sperm banking, including the cost of sperm storage.\nIf you still have a remaining testicle, in most cases (90%)&nbsp;your body will make enough testosterone so you won&#8217;t notice any difference.\nIf there are any problems with your remaining testicle, you may experience symptoms due to a lack of testosterone. These symptoms can be caused for other reasons but can include:\n- tiredness\n- weight gain\n- loss of libido&nbsp;(sex drive)\n- reduced beard growth\n- reduced ability to achieve or maintain an erection (erectile dysfunction)\nHaving both testicles removed will definitely stop you producing testosterone and you&#8217;ll develop the above symptoms.\nTestosterone replacement therapy is where you&#8217;re given testosterone in the form of an injection, skin patch or gel to rub into your skin. If you have injections, you&#8217;ll usually need to have them every 2 to 3 months.\nAfter having testosterone replacement therapy, you&#8217;ll be able to maintain an erection and your sex drive will improve.\nSide effects associated with this type of treatment are uncommon, and any side effects that you do experience will usually be mild. They may include:\n- oily skin, which can sometimes trigger the onset of acne\n- breast enlargement and swelling\n- a change in&nbsp;normal urinary patterns, such as needing to urinate more frequently or having problems passing urine (caused by an enlarged prostate gland that puts pressure on your bladder)\nThere are also concerns that testosterone replacement may increase the risk of&nbsp;prostate cancer and you should discuss this with your doctor.\nHowever, the risks from having testosterone replacement are usually much lower than the benefits of receiving it.\nMore advanced cases of testicular cancer may spread to your lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are part of your body&#8217;s immune system, which helps protect against illness and infection.\nLymph node surgery is carried out under general anaesthetic. The lymph nodes in your abdomen are the nodes most likely to need removing.\nIn some cases, the nerves near the lymph nodes can become damaged, which means that rather than ejaculating semen out of your penis during sex or masturbation, the semen instead travels back into your bladder. This is known as retrograde ejaculation.\nIf you have retrograde ejaculation, you&#8217;ll still experience the sensation of having an orgasm during ejaculation, but you won&#8217;t be able to father a child.\nThere are a number of ways of treating retrograde ejaculation, including the use of medicines that strengthen the muscles around the neck of the bladder to prevent the flow of semen into the bladder.\nMen and anyone with testicles who wants to have children can have sperm taken from their urine for use in&nbsp;artificial insemination or in-vitro fertilisation (IVF).\nThere are also a number of&nbsp;newer surgical techniques that carry a lower risk of retrograde ejaculation and infertility.&nbsp;\nSome people with testicular cancer have deposits of cancer in their lungs and these may also need to be removed after chemotherapy if they haven&#8217;t disappeared or reduced sufficiently in size. This type of surgery is also carried out under general anaesthetic and doesn&#8217;t usually significantly affect breathing in the long-term.\nA newer type of lymph node surgery, called nerve sparing retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND), is increasingly being used because it carries a lower risk of causing retrograde ejaculation and infertility.\nIn nerve-sparing RPLND, the site of the operation is limited to a much smaller area. This means there&#8217;s less chance of nerve damage occurring. The disadvantage is that the surgery is more technically demanding. Therefore, nerve-sparing RPLND is currently only available at specialist centres that employ surgeons with the required training.\nLaparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (LRPLND) is a type of &#8216;keyhole&#8217; surgery that can be used to remove the lymph nodes. During LRPLND, the surgeon will make a number of small incisions in your abdomen.\nAn instrument called an endoscope is inserted into one of the incisions. An endoscope is a thin, long, flexible tube with a light and a camera at one end, enabling images of the inside of your body to be relayed to an external television monitor.\nSmall, surgical instruments are passed down the endoscope and can be used to remove the affected lymph nodes.\nThe advantage of LRPLND is that there&#8217;s less post-operative pain and a quicker recovery time. Also, as with nerve-sparing RPLND, in LRPLND there&#8217;s a smaller chance that nerve damage will lead to retrograde ejaculation.\nHowever, as LRPLND is a new technique, there&#8217;s little available evidence regarding the procedure&#8217;s long-term safety and effectiveness. If you&#8217;re considering&nbsp;LRPLND, you should understand there are still uncertainties about the safety and effectiveness of&nbsp;the procedure.\nRadiotherapy&nbsp;uses high-energy beams of radiation to help destroy cancer cells. Sometimes, seminomas may require radiotherapy after surgery to help prevent the cancer returning.\nIt may also be needed in advanced cases where someone is unable to tolerate the complex chemotherapies that are usually used to treat stage 2, 3 and 4 testicular cancer.\nIf testicular cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, you may require radiotherapy after a course of chemotherapy.\nSide effects of radiotherapy&nbsp;can include:\n- reddening and soreness of the skin, which is similar to&nbsp;sunburn\n- nausea\n- diarrhoea&nbsp;\n- fatigue\nThese side effects are usually only temporary and should improve when your treatment is completed.\nChemotherapy&nbsp;uses powerful medicines to kill the malignant (cancerous) cells in your body or stop them multiplying.\nYou may require chemotherapy if&nbsp;you have advanced testicular cancer or it&#8217;s spread within your body. It&#8217;s also used to help prevent the cancer returning. Chemotherapy is commonly used to treat seminomas and non-seminoma tumours.\nChemotherapy medicines for testicular cancer are usually injected into a vein. In some cases, a special tube called a central line is used, which stays in a vein throughout your treatment so that you don&#8217;t have to keep having blood tests or needles placed in a new vein.\nSometimes, chemotherapy medicines can attack your body&#8217;s normal, healthy cells. This is why chemotherapy can have many different side effects. The most common&nbsp;include:\n- vomiting\n- hair loss&nbsp;\n- nausea\n- sore mouth and&nbsp;mouth ulcers&nbsp;\n- loss of appetite\n- fatigue\n- breathlessness and lung damage&nbsp;\n- infertility\n- ringing in your ears (tinnitus)\n- skin that bleeds or bruises easily\n- low blood counts&nbsp;\n- increased vulnerability to infection&nbsp;\n- numbness and tingling (pins and needles) in your hands and feet\n- kidney damage\nThese side effects are usually only temporary and should improve after you&#8217;ve completed your treatment.\nSide effects, such as infections that occur when you have a low blood count, can be life-threatening, and it&#8217;s essential that you always call your cancer care team if you&#8217;re worried between chemotherapy treatments.\nOne of the medicines commonly used, called bleomycin, can cause long-term lung damage and you should discuss this with your doctors if damage to your lungs would have specific issues for your career or lifestyle. However, the advice may still be that you should receive it for the best chance of a cure.\nYou shouldn&#8217;t father children while having chemotherapy and for a year after your treatment has finished. This is because chemotherapy medications can temporarily damage your sperm, increasing your risk of fathering a baby with serious birth defects. Therefore, you&#8217;ll need to use a reliable method of contraception, such as a condom, during this time.\nCondoms should also be used during the first 48 hours after having a course of chemotherapy. This is to protect your partner from any potentially harmful effects of the chemotherapy medication in your sperm.\nRead more about the side effects of chemotherapy.\nEven if your cancer has been completely cured, there&#8217;s a risk it will return.&nbsp;The risk of your cancer returning will depend on what stage it was at&nbsp;when you were diagnosed and what treatment you&#8217;ve had since.\nMost recurrences of non-seminoma testicular cancer occur within 2 years of surgery or completion of chemotherapy. In seminomas, recurrences still occur until 3 years. Recurrences after 3 years are rare, occurring in less than 5% of people.\nBecause of the risk of recurrence, you&#8217;ll need regular tests to check if the cancer has returned. These include:\n- a physical examination\n- blood tests&nbsp;to check for tumour markers\n- a chest&nbsp;X-ray\n- a&nbsp;computerised tomography (CT) scan\nFollow-up and testing is usually recommended depending&nbsp;on the extent of the cancer and the treatment offered. This is usually more frequent in the first year or two but follow-up appointments may last for up to 5 years. In certain cases, it may be necessary to continue follow-up appointments for 10 years or longer.\nIf the cancer returns following treatment for stage 1 testicular cancer, and it&#8217;s diagnosed at an early stage, it will usually be possible to cure it using chemotherapy and possibly also radiotherapy. Some types of recurring testicular cancer have a cure rate of over 95%.\nRecurrences that occur after previous combination chemotherapy can also be cured, but the chances of this will vary between individuals and you&#8217;ll need to ask your doctors to discuss this with you.\nCancer Research UK has more information about follow-up for testicular cancer.\nThe causes of testicular cancer are not fully understood.\nHowever, several things that increase your&nbsp;risk of developing the condition.\nUndescended testicles is the most significant risk factor.\nWhen male babies grow in the womb, their testicles develop inside their abdomen. The testicles then normally move down into the scrotum when the baby is born or during their first year of life.\nHowever, for some children, the testicles fail to descend. The medical name for&nbsp;undescended testicles is cryptorchidism.&nbsp;\nSurgery is usually required to move the testicles down. If you have had surgery to move your testicles down into your scrotum, your risk of developing testicular cancer may be increased.\nOf surgery is performed before the child is 13 years of age, their risk of later developing testicular cancer is approximately double that of the rest of the population. However, if the operation is carried out after the boy is 13 years of age, the risk of developing testicular cancer is 5 times greater&nbsp;than that of&nbsp;the rest of the population.\nMen and anyone with testicles who has previously been diagnosed with testicular cancer are 12 times more likely to develop testicular cancer in the other testicle.\nFor this reason, it&#8217;s important to attend follow-up appointments if you have previously been diagnosed with testicular cancer.\nUnlike most other types of cancer, testicular cancer is more common in young and middle-aged men and anyone with testicles. Men and anyone with testicles aged 30&nbsp;to 34 are most likely to be diagnosed with testicular cancer.\nTesticular cancer is more common in white men and anyone with testicles than other ethnic groups. It&#8217;s also more common in Northern and Western Europe compared with other parts of the world.\nHaving a close relative with a history of testicular cancer increases your risk of developing it.\nIf your father had testicular cancer, you are 4 to 6 times more likely to develop&nbsp;it than&nbsp;a person with no family history of the condition. If your brother had testicular cancer, you are 8 to 10 times more likely to develop it (having an identical twin with testicular cancer means that you are 75 times more likely to develop it).\nThe fact that testicular cancer appears to run in families has led researchers to speculate that there may be one or more genetic mutations (abnormal changes to the instructions that control cell activity) that make a person more likely to develop testicular cancer.\nMutations in 2 genes (known as the KITLG and SPRY4 genes) may&nbsp;increase the risk of a person developing testicular cancer.\nExamples of endocrine disruptors include:\n- some types of pesticide\n- polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chemical compounds used as a coolant\n- dibutyl phthalate, a chemical used to manufacture cosmetics, such as nail polish\nIn most countries, including the UK, many endocrine disruptors, such as PCBs, have been withdrawn as a result of their link to health problems. However, there is a concern that exposure to endocrine disruptors may still occur due to contamination of the food chain.\nHowever, there is not yet enough evidence to prove a definite link between indirect exposure to low levels of endocrine disruptors and health problems. Indirect exposure is the type of exposure that would occur if the food chain was contaminated.\nMen and anyone with testicles who are infertile&nbsp;are 3 times more likely to develop testicular cancer. The reasons for this are not clear.\nResearch has found that long-term smokers (people who have been smoking a pack of 20 cigarettes a day for 12 years or 10 cigarettes a day for 24 years) are twice as likely to develop testicular cancer&nbsp;than non-smokers.&nbsp;\nStudies show that men and anyone with testicles with&nbsp;HIV or AIDS have an increased risk of testicular cancer."

        "description": "It can be embarrassing to talk about your testicles and any changes to them that you’ve noticed. Understanding more about what they do might help.\nTesticles are small and oval-shaped. They hang below your penis in a sac called the scrotum.\nFrom puberty, your testicles produce a hormone called testosterone. This gives you a lower voice, hair on your face and body, and makes your muscles get bigger. You also need it for your sex drive and for getting an erection.\nThe testicles make sperm from puberty (around 13&nbsp;to 14 years old) onwards. When sperm meets with a female egg during sex, this can cause pregnancy.\nThe testicles make millions of sperm a day, but if sperm are not ejaculated they are reabsorbed back into your body.\nSperm wait in the epididymis next to the testicle until they are ejaculated. At ejaculation, they travel up through the spermatic cord and mix with fluid from the prostate to make semen. They go out of the body through the urethra (this is the same tube you pass urine (pee) through).\nLymph nodes are small and round, and connect to each other by tiny tubes that carry fluid called lymph. We have lymph nodes throughout our bodies. They are part of the lymphatic system, which protects us from infections.\nSometimes cancer cells from the testicle can spread to lymph nodes at the back of the abdomen (tummy). You’ll have a scan to check your lymph nodes.\nIf you&#8217;re looking for information for all ages about testicular cancer,&nbsp;read&nbsp;our general testicular cancer section.\nYou may have tests done by your GP or at the hospital. They will help your doctors see whether you have testicular cancer.\nIf you think you might have some of the symptoms of testicular cancer, you should go to your GP. They&#8217;ll be able to talk to you about your symptoms. If they think the symptoms could be because of cancer they can do tests to find out more.\nIf your doctor thinks there is a chance you might have cancer, they’ll examine your testicles. They might also arrange for you to have an ultrasound test. This uses sound waves to take a picture of the testicles.\nIf you need more tests you’ll be referred to a hospital. This could be a general hospital or a specialist cancer hospital.\nYou&#8217;ll be seen by a specialist doctor (urologist), who will examine you and do the following tests:\n- blood tests to check for chemicals in the blood called tumour markers – some testicular cancers (but not all) produce high levels of these\n- an ultrasound scan of the scrotum and testicles (if you haven’t already had one) – this can usually tell the difference between a cancer and a cyst (a harmless lump filled with fluid)\nIf your ultrasound shows the lump is almost certainly cancer, an operation to remove a testicle (orchidectomy) is done. You’ll only have this operation if it’s necessary. Your specialist will explain this to you. After the operation a doctor will use a microscope to look for cancer cells in the removed testicle.\nThis may be the only operation you need. It will not stop you having sex or becoming a dad in the future.\nIf testicular cancer is diagnosed you will need some other tests:\n- more blood tests to check how well your liver and kidneys are working, and to check your tumour markers again\n- chest X-rays to check your lungs are healthy – this is sometimes done before the operation\n- CT, MRI, or PET scans to find out if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes at the back of your abdomen (tummy), or to anywhere else in your body\nYou’ll be seen by a cancer specialist and usually a specialist nurse at a cancer treatment centre to get your test results. The results will help your specialist plan the best treatment for you.\nHaving tests and waiting for the results can be a scary time. Talking about how you feel and getting support from your family, friends, specialist nurse and doctor can make it a bit easier.\nIf you need any further treatment you will have it at the cancer treatment centre.\nIf you&#8217;re looking for information for all ages about testicular cancer, read our general testicular cancer section.\nTreatment for testicular cancer can be very successful. Surgery and chemotherapy are the 2 main types of treatment. Often people have both treatments.\nTo make sure you have the right treatment, your specialist needs to know what stage the cancer is. The stage of a cancer describes the tumour and whether it has spread outside the testicle. You may need some more tests to confirm what stage you are at. Waiting to hear about the stage of the cancer can be worrying. But this information is important because it helps your doctors plan the right treatment.\nTreatment for testicular cancer can be really successful. Most young men with testicular cancer are cured, even if the cancer has spread. If you have any questions about your treatment, don&#8217;t be afraid to ask your doctor or nurse.\nSurgery&nbsp;to remove the testicle is one of the main treatments for testicular cancer. The operation is called an orchidectomy. It can be done as a day patient or during a short stay in hospital.\nYou may feel shocked and scared at the thought of having this done. Your doctor and nurse will tell you more about it so that you know what to expect.\nThe surgeon makes a small cut (incision) through your lower abdomen (tummy) in the groin on the affected side. The testicle is pushed up from the scrotum and removed through the cut.\nDuring the operation the surgeon can put a false testicle into your scrotum so that you’ll look the same as before. Your surgeon will explain this to you before the operation, or you can ask them about it. If this wasn’t done at the time of the operation, but now you think you would like this, talk to your doctor or nurse. It is a small operation to put this in later on.\nYou&#8217;ll have a small dressing where the cut was made. This can usually be removed a day or so after the operation. The stitches in the wound will dissolve by themselves over the next few months.\nYou&#8217;ll probably feel a bit sore and you’ll be given painkillers to take regularly. Let your nurse or doctor know if they’re not controlling the pain. Wearing fitted briefs or shorts that support you and loose trousers like jogging bottoms can feel more comfortable after your operation.\nYou’ll probably feel tired and need to take things easy for about a week. You can expect to make a quick recovery after this operation.\nIf one of your testicles is removed, you will still be able to have sex and make someone pregnant. Your other testicle should produce enough of the hormone testosterone and sperm.\nIt isn&#8217;t common to have both testicles removed. If you’ve had this done then you’ll be prescribed testosterone so you&#8217;ll still be able to have sex. But you won&#8217;t be making sperm now, so you won’t be able to make someone pregnant through sex. Your doctor will talk to you about sperm banking before your surgery. Storing your sperm before the operation can help you to become a dad in the future. Our sections on sex and relationships and fertility have more information as well as ways of coping.\nIf after surgery the chance of the cancer coming back is very low, your doctor might suggest you have surveillance. This means having regular checks to look for signs of the cancer coming back. If it does come back and it’s picked up very early, then it’s easy to cure. If the cancer doesn’t come back then you’ve avoided having unnecessary treatment. At each clinic appointment, your doctor will examine you and you may have blood tests and chest X-rays.\nGoing to all your surveillance appointments is really important. You could put a reminder in your phone.\nChemotherapy&nbsp;is when you’re given anti-cancer drugs to destroy the cancer cells.\nYou might be given chemotherapy:\n- after the operation to remove your testicle, to reduce the chance of the cancer coming back\n- to destroy cancer cells that have already spread outside the testicle\n- if the cancer comes back\n- occasionally before surgery, if the cancer has spread\nChemotherapy can affect your fertility. Before your chemotherapy starts, your doctor will talk to you about storing some of your sperm. This is called sperm banking. We have more information about fertility issues.\nChemotherapy is given into a vein as injections or drips. You have your chemotherapy through one of the following:\n- a fine tube called a cannula\n- a line into a vein in the chest (called a central line)\n- a line into the arm (PICC line) that leads into a vein in the chest\nFind out more about how chemotherapy is given.\nThe amount of chemotherapy you have depends on the stage of the cancer. If the stage is low then you will have 1&nbsp;to 2 cycles (sessions) of chemotherapy. If the stage is higher, or if the cancer comes back during surveillance, you’ll usually have 3&nbsp;to 4 cycles of chemotherapy.\nThe drugs most often used to treat testicular cancer are cisplatin, etoposide and bleomycin. Giving these drugs together is called BEP.\nChemotherapy is given in cycles of treatment. A cycle usually takes 3 weeks. If you have BEP, you’ll usually spend 3 to 5 days of the first week having your chemotherapy as a day patient, or you might need to stay in hospital overnight. After this you’ll come back to the clinic for another injection of chemotherapy a week later, and again the following week.\nIf the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, or if it isn’t going away completely with BEP, then different chemotherapy drugs can be given.\nDifferent chemotherapy drugs cause different side effects. You will probably have a few side effects, but it&#8217;s hard to know exactly how it&#8217;s going to be you. Your doctor will do everything they can to treat any side effects you have.\nMost side effects are short-term and gradually disappear once treatment stops. The most common temporary side effects are:\n- hair loss\n- tiredness\n- feeling sick or being sick (which can be controlled with medicines)\n- being more at risk of getting an infection\nThere’s more information in the chemotherapy section.\nSometimes side effects can be long-term. For example, although chemotherapy usually only affects fertility for a year or so, sometimes it’s permanent.\nThere may be other late effects of treatment and your specialist can talk to you about this.\nIf the lymph nodes at the back of your tummy area are still swollen after chemotherapy, they’re usually removed with an operation.&nbsp;Lymph nodes are part of the body&#8217;s immune system and help fight infection. The lymph nodes in the tummy are called the retroperitoneal lymph nodes, so the operation is called a &#8216;retroperitoneal lymph node dissection&#8217;. The operation will be done by experienced surgeons in specialist centres.\nThe lymph nodes might contain cells that could become cancerous in the future, so having them removed is the only certain way to find this out.\nYou might be in hospital for up to 10 days. The surgeon usually makes a cut from the top of your tummy (near your breastbone) to below your belly button. This leaves you with a scar but it’ll gradually fade until it ends up looking like a fine line.\nSometimes you have surgery to remove any abnormal cells in areas like the lung or the lymph nodes in the chest.\nYou’ll have a drip in your arm to give you fluids until you’re able to eat and drink normally. You’ll also have drainage tubes from the wound to stop any extra fluid collecting. The nurses will keep a check on the dressing over your wound and change it when needed. You’ll be given painkillers to take regularly. Your staples (like metal stitches) are removed 7 to 10 days after the operation.\nIt might take a few months to get back to the level of fitness you had before.\nThis operation can affect your fertility, because the nerves that control the release of sperm (ejaculation) may be damaged by surgery. Surgeons use &#8216;nerve-sparing’ techniques to try to stop this happening. The operation doesn’t usually stop you getting an erection or having an orgasm.\nIf you&#8217;re looking for information for all ages about testicular cancer, read our general testicular cancer section.\nBeing diagnosed with cancer can have a big impact on your life, even after you&#8217;ve finished treatment.\nOnce you finish your treatment, you’ll have regular follow-up appointments at the hospital. You’ll have blood tests for tumour markers and sometimes other scans or X-rays. If the tumour markers go up, this can be a sign that the cancer has come back. This means you need more treatment, which can still cure the cancer.\nYou might find it embarrassing to talk about your private parts and how the cancer or cancer treatment has affected them. It can feel awkward talking to doctors or your family about this.\nTry not to let this put you off talking about things. It can be really helpful to let someone know how you&#8217;re feeling, so that you don&#8217;t bottle things up.\nFertility is the ability to have children. Some cancers and cancer treatments can affect a young man’s fertility, but your doctors will always think about this when planning your treatment. Your doctor will talk to you about sperm banking prior to treatment if this might happen.\nIf only&nbsp;1&nbsp;of your testicles has been removed, the one left should continue to make sperm and produce enough testosterone so that your fertility is not affected. You can still have sex.\nIf you have chemotherapy, your ability to produce sperm might be affected. After chemotherapy you can have a sample checked to see if this has happened. You can still have sex, but when you are on chemotherapy (and for a few months afterwards) you should always wear a condom to protect your partner from the chemotherapy.\nIf you had an operation to remove both of your testicles or the lymph nodes at the back of your tummy (abdomen), your fertility and your ability to have sex may be affected. This is a really tough thing to cope with on top of everything else that you’re going through. Your specialist nurse will provide support and help you find more advice and support if you feel you need it. There are things which can be done to help so that you can still have sex.\nIf you&#8217;re looking for information for all ages about testicular cancer, read our general testicular cancer section."

        "description": "Lumps and swellings in the testicles (balls) are relatively common in boys, men and anyone with testicles.\nIt&#8217;s important to know what&#8217;s normal for you so you can notice any changes in your testicles.\n&bull; sudden, severe pain in a testicle&bull; testicle pain along with feeling sick, being sick or pain in your tummy&bull; testicle pain that has lasted more than an hour or continues when you&#8217;re restingThese can be signs of a serious problem that needs to be treated in hospital as soon as possible.Find your nearest A&amp;E\nThere is not a singular test for testicular lumps and swellings. The doctor will discuss your situation and carry out a physical examination.\nYour doctor may:\n- look at and feel your testicles\n- shine a torch through the bag of skin containing your testicles (scrotum) to check for a build-up of fluid\n- refer you for an ultrasound scan\n- take a urine (pee) sample if they suspect your lump or swelling may be caused by an infection\nIf the lump or swelling is painful or very big, your doctor may refer you to a specialist for an operation to drain, shrink or remove it.\nLumps and swellings in the testicles can have lots of different causes.\nThe vast majority of testicular lumps and swellings are caused by non-cancerous (benign) conditions. Most of these may not need treatment.\nIf you experience testicular lumps and swellings, they may be caused by:\n- varicoceles – soft lumps that develop gradually above the testicle and on the left side of the scrotum\n- hydroceles – swellings in the scrotum caused by a build-up of fluid\n- epididymal cysts – a small, smooth fluid-filled swelling that slowly develops in the epididymis (a coil-like structure behind the testicles that helps to store and transport sperm)\n- epididymo-orchitis – inflammation in the epididymis and the testicle caused by bacterial infections such as urinary tract infections (UTIs), sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and mumps\n- inguinal hernias – when fatty tissue or part of the bowel pokes through into the groin at the top of the inner thigh\n- testicular torsion– a benign but serious condition caused by the spermatic cord (the cord that supplies blood to the testicles) becoming severely twisted\n- testicular cancer – a more serious health condition\nTreatment for testicular lumps and swellings will vary depending on what&#8217;s causing it.\nPainkillers such as paracetamol can be taken to ease discomfort or pain.\nIn some cases, surgery may be used to treat some testicular lumps and swellings. The surgery is carried out under either local anaesthetic or general anaesthetic depending on the procedure.\nAntibiotics may be prescribed if the cause is a bacterial infection.\nIf you have been diagnosed with testicular cancer, you will be cared for by a team of clinicians who will help decide the best treatment for you. Surgery to remove the affected testicle will be recommended in most cases and this may sometimes be followed by a course of chemotherapy or radiotherapy."

        "disease": "Thirst",
        "description": "Feeling thirsty all the time and for no good reason isn&#8217;t normal and should be investigated by your GP.\nThirst is normally just&nbsp;the brain&#8217;s way of warning that you&#8217;re&nbsp;dehydrated&nbsp;because you&#8217;re not drinking enough fluid. But&nbsp;excessive and persistent thirst (known as&nbsp;polydipsia) could be a sign of&nbsp;an underlying problem such as&nbsp;diabetes.\nYou will usually feel thirsty because you&#8217;re not&nbsp;drinking the amount of fluid your body needs. This may be because you&#8217;ve been sweating heavily or you&#8217;ve lost fluid because you have&nbsp;diarrhoea&nbsp;and are&nbsp;vomiting.\nYou can soon quench your thirst and restore the fluid balance in your body by having a drink and ensuring you remain well hydrated.\nIt&#8217;s&nbsp;particularly important to stay well hydrated&nbsp;during hot weather, while exercising and while you&#8217;re unwell with vomiting and diarrhoea.&nbsp;\nIn some cases, thirst may be caused by something as simple as a recent meal or snack. Eating&nbsp;salty or spicy foods can cause you to suddenly feel thirsty.\nIf you feel thirsty all the time, it could be a sign of diabetes&nbsp;– particularly if you also have other symptoms such as needing to urinate frequently, extreme tiredness (fatigue) and&nbsp;unexplained weight loss.\nDiabetes is a lifelong condition that makes it difficult to control the level of sugar (glucose) in your blood. The high levels of glucose can mean your kidneys need to produce more urine to help pass the glucose out of your body. This can make you feel thirsty because your brain is telling you to drink more to make up for the fluids you&#8217;ve lost.\nIf you feel thirsty all the time and have other symptoms, your GP will probably carry out a blood glucose test to see whether you have diabetes.\nFeeling thirsty, as well as urinating more often than usual, is a common symptom in pregnancy and usually nothing to worry about.&nbsp;\nVery occasionally, these problems can be a sign of gestational diabetes (a type of diabetes that affects women during pregnancy). You should be screened for this as part of your&nbsp;antenatal care&nbsp;if you&#8217;re at risk.\nExcessive thirst can&nbsp;sometimes be a side effect of certain types of medication, including lithium, certain antipsychotics and diuretics (water tablets).\nIf you think a particular medicine is causing your thirst, it may be possible to change to a different medicine or reduce your dose. Speak to your GP about this.\nThere are also many other potential causes of severe thirst. These include:\n- diabetes insipidus – a condition caused by problems with a hormone that regulates the amount of fluid in the body\n- diabetic ketoacidosis – a dangerous complication of diabetes caused by a lack of the hormone insulin in the body\n- sickle cell aneamia – an inherited blood disorder\n- psychogenic polydipsia – where a person with a mental health condition, such as&nbsp;schizophrenia, drinks excessive amounts of water that can&#8217;t be excreted (got rid of) by the kidneys\n- excessive bleeding"

        "description": "Threadworms (pinworms) are tiny worms in your poo. They&#8217;re common in children and are spread easily. You can treat them without seeing a GP.\nYou may spot threadworms in your poo. The worms look like threads of white cotton and are about 1cm long.\nYou might also see them around your child&#8217;s bottom (anus). The worms usually come out at night while your child is sleeping.\nOther symptoms include:\n- extreme itching around the anus or vagina, particularly at night\n- irritability and wakening up during the night\nLess common symptoms include:\n- weight loss\n- wetting the bed\n- irritated skin around the anus\nIf you or your child have threadworms you can get advice and treatment directly from a pharmacy.\nYour pharmacist may recommend that you speak to your GP if required.\nMedication will kill the threadworms but not the eggs. Eggs can live for up to 2 weeks outside the body.\nThere are hygiene methods you can follow to stop becoming infected again. Do these for 2 weeks if you’re taking medicine, or for 6 weeks if you’re not taking medicine.\nMebendazole is the main medication used to treat threadworm infection. It can be bought over the counter from your local pharmacy or prescribed by your GP. This is usually a chewable tablet or liquid you swallow.\nTreat everyone over 2 years old in your household, even if they do not have symptoms.\nTell the pharmacist if you need to treat a child under 2 years old, or if you&#8217;re pregnant or breastfeeding. Treatment might not be suitable and you may need to speak to a GP.\nIf you cannot take medicine you can treat threadworms by using hygiene methods for 6 weeks.\nThreadworm infection most commonly affects young children because they often forget to wash their hands and share toys with other children.\nPeople who are in close contact with someone with a threadworm infection also have a high risk of infection. This is why all members of a household need to be treated when someone has a threadworm infection.\nThreadworms spread when their eggs are swallowed. They lay eggs around your bottom (anus) or vagina, which can cause an itchy bottom. The eggs get stuck on your fingers when you scratch. They can then pass on to anything you touch, including:\n- clothes\n- toys\n- toothbrushes\n- kitchen or bathroom surfaces\n- bedding\n- food\nEggs can pass to other people when they touch these surfaces and then touch their mouth. The eggs can survive up to 2 weeks. The larvae hatch from the eggs in your gut after you swallow them, and take 1 to 2 months to mature into threadworms.\nChildren can get threadworms again after they&#8217;ve been treated for them if they get the eggs in their mouth. This is why it&#8217;s important to encourage children to wash their hands regularly."

If you do have a test, a doctor or nurse may:\n- look at the genital area\n- use a swab (cotton bud) to collect a sample from the parts of the body that could be affected such as the vagina\nThrush may have similar symptoms to some STIs, so it’s important you seek advice if you think you may be at risk of an STI.\nTreatment is simple and only necessary if you have signs and symptoms of thrush.\nYou may be given:\n- antifungal cream to apply to the genital area\n- vaginal pessaries (tablets that you put into your vagina)\n- oral pills\n- a combination of treatments\nYour doctor or nurse will tell you how to use the treatment.\nIt’s very important to take the treatment as instructed and finish any course of treatment even if the symptoms go away earlier.\nYou can buy antifungal treatments from most pharmacies if you&#8217;ve been diagnosed with thrush in the past and you know the symptoms.\nSome antifungal products can weaken latex condoms, diaphragms and caps. You should avoid sex while undergoing treatment if this is your method of contraception.\nYou should tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you’re pregnant, might be pregnant, or if you’re breastfeeding. This may affect the type of treatment you’re given.\nIf thrush isn&#8217;t treated it eventually goes away on its own.\nThere’s no need for your partner(s) to have treatment unless they have signs and symptoms of thrush.\nYour chances of developing thrush increase if:\n- your skin is irritated or damaged\n- you&#8217;re taking antibiotics\n- you have poorly controlled diabetes\n- you have a weakened immune system – for example you&#8217;re having chemotherapy or living with HIV\n- you&#8217;re having hormone replacement therapy (HRT)\n- you&#8217;re pregnant\n- you use products that irritate the skin such as perfumed products, bubble baths or vaginal washing products\nSome people find that different triggers cause thrush. If you notice a pattern, you may be able to help control it.\nThere are things you can do to relieve symptoms and stop thrush from coming back.\nIf you’re prescribed an antibiotic for another condition, remind your doctor that you tend to get thrush and ask for some preventive treatment for thrush at the same time.\nSome people may only get thrush once. Others may get it multiple times.\nYou may need to take treatment for longer if you keep getting thrush (you get it more than 4 times in 12 months).\nIf you get recurrent thrush the doctor or nurse will want to check that other conditions, such as diabetes, aren’t the cause of the thrush.\nThey&#8217;ll recommend how often you should use treatment."

These terms all mean the same thing.\nWhen you have a fracture, it&#8217;s not just the bone that&#8217;s affected. You&#8217;ll also have injured some of the soft tissues around it. Soft tissues include the:\n- muscles\n- ligaments\n- tendons\n- nerves\nMost of the healing happens between 3 to 6 weeks after your thumb fracture.\nIt&#8217;s normal to have aches and discomfort beyond this. This usually happens when you try activities you haven’t done for a while. It&#8217;s also normal for the area to be more sensitive for a while after the injury.\nIt&#8217;s good to use your hand in day-to-day activities. However, remember that this is exercise too. Sometimes you might need to rest if your hand aches after doing some activities.\nThere are some things that might impact on your recovery.\nSmoking affects all of your tissues and slows facture healing times. In some people, it can stop healing altogether.\nStopping smoking as your fracture heals will help to ensure the best recovery.\nGet help to stop smoking.\nSome medical conditions, like diabetes, may slow down the healing process.\nEating a healthy diet and keeping yourself active will help your recovery.\nSome medications can slow down fracture healing. If you have concerns about your medication, talk to a healthcare professional.\nAnti-inflammatory medication, like Ibuprofen or Naproxen, has been shown to delay healing.\nA thumb fracture is a minor fracture. It&#8217;s often treated in the same way as a sprain.\nSome people may be fitted with a splint or a wrist splint with a thumb piece. You may only need these for a couple of weeks.\nIt&#8217;s normal to have some discomfort in the areas around your fracture, including:\n- other soft tissues\n- nearby joints\n- areas that have been immobilised\nPain can change from day to day and it doesn’t always depend on what you&#8217;re doing. It&#8217;s common to have pain at rest.\nIt&#8217;s normal to have some pain even when your fracture has healed. Some people also experience discomfort in the fracture site during colder weather.\nYour local pharmacy can give you advice on managing pain after a fracture.\nUse Scotland&#8217;s Service Directory to find your local pharmacy.\nSwelling is the start of healing. It&#8217;s normal to have swelling near the fracture. It can then spread into your hand or wrist.\nThe swelling might change depending on:\n- your position\n- your activity\n- the time of day\nEven when your fracture has healed it&#8217;s normal to have some swelling. This can last for several months.\nHaving a lot of swelling can become uncomfortable or limit your movement. There are some things you can do to reduce the swelling. You can try to:\n- raise your arm above your heart when you&#8217;re resting &#8211;&nbsp;you can do this by supporting it with pillows\n- keep the other joints in your hand and arm moving normally\n- avoid too much rest and too much activity\n- massage the swelling\nIt&#8217;s normal to have bruising after a fracture.\nBruising can be widespread and may appear a long way from your fracture. It can be very purple to start with and may change colour as you recover.\nThere are some things you should consider when trying to get back to your normal activities.\nYou should contact your insurance provider before driving. Your injury may affect your insurance.\nOnce you&#8217;re out of your splint, you must be able to safely perform an emergency stop or manoeuvre.\nYou should always be in full control of your vehicle.\nYour return to work will depend on the type of work you do and your employer. It may be possible to discuss a phased return to work or changed duties.\nYou don’t need to see a healthcare professional to return to work.\nKeep doing any activities you&#8217;re able to, as your pain allows. Gradually increase what you do.\nReduced flexibility and strength may make things more difficult to start with. This will get better as you slowly build up to all of your usual activities.\nFrustration or low mood after an injury is normal. As you get back to normal life this should get better.\nLoss of confidence is common after a fracture.\nFurther advice about preventing falls.\nThere are things you can do to help your recovery after a thumb fracture.\nBetween 0 to 3 weeks after your injury, you should:\n- use the affected hand within the splint for light activities like eating, dressing or typing on a keyboard, as long as the pain allows\n- increase the movement in your thumb, fingers and wrist with gentle exercises\n- manage your pain and swelling\n- wean yourself out of using your splint as far as comfort allows\nAfter 3 to 6 weeks you can gradually return your hand to full function. You can also begin to resume normal day to day activities.\nYou should avoid contact sports or heavy lifting until at least 12 weeks post fracture.&nbsp;\n52\n1:07\n37\n38\n37\n1:00\nStop exercising if it makes your symptoms worse, or it causes new pain.\nIf your thumb function hasn’t improved within 6 weeks of following this advice, it’s a good idea to talk to a healthcare professional about your symptoms."

        "disease": "Thyroid cancer",
        "description": "Thyroid cancer is a rare type of cancer that affects the thyroid gland, a small gland at the base of the neck.\nThe most common symptom of&nbsp;cancer of the thyroid is a painless lump or swelling that develops in the neck.\nOther symptoms only tend to occur after&nbsp;the condition has reached an advanced stage, and may include:\n- unexplained hoarseness that lasts for more than a few weeks\n- a&nbsp;sore throat or difficulty swallowing that doesn&#8217;t get better&nbsp;\n- a lump elsewhere&nbsp;in your&nbsp;neck\nIf you have a lump in your thyroid gland, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean you have thyroid cancer.&nbsp;About 1 in 20 thyroid lumps are cancerous.&nbsp;\nRead more about the symptoms of thyroid cancer\nThe thyroid gland consists of 2&nbsp;lobes located on&nbsp;either side of the windpipe. Its main purpose is to release hormones (chemicals that have powerful effects on many different functions of the body).\nThe thyroid gland releases 3&nbsp;separate hormones:\n- triiodothyronine –&nbsp;known as T3\n- thyroxine –&nbsp;known as T4\n- calcitonin\nThe T3 and T4 hormones help regulate the body&#8217;s metabolic rate (the rate at which the various processes in the body work, such as how quickly calories are burnt).\nAn excess of&nbsp;T3 and T4 will make you feel overactive and you&nbsp;may lose weight. If you don&#8217;t have enough of these hormones, you&#8217;ll feel sluggish and you&nbsp;may gain weight.\nCalcitonin helps control blood calcium levels. Calcium is a mineral that performs a number of important functions, such as building strong bones.\nCalcitonin isn&#8217;t essential for maintaining good health because your body also has other ways of controlling calcium.\nThere are 4&nbsp;main types of thyroid cancer. They are:\n- papillary carcinoma – this is the most common type, accounting for about 6 out of 10&nbsp;(60%) cases; it usually affects people under the age of 40, particularly women\n- follicular carcinoma – accounts for around&nbsp;3 out of 20 (15%) cases of thyroid cancer and tends to affect older adults\n- medullary thyroid carcinoma – accounts for between 5 and 8 out of every 100 diagnosed cases (5% to 8%); unlike the other types of thyroid cancer, medullary thyroid carcinoma&nbsp;can run in families&nbsp;\n- anaplastic thyroid carcinoma – this is the rarest and most aggressive type of thyroid cancer, accounting for less than 1&nbsp;in 20 thyroid cancers; it usually affects older people over the age of 60&nbsp;\nPapillary and follicular carcinomas are sometimes known as differentiated thyroid cancers, and they&#8217;re often treated in the same way.\nThyroid cancer is a rare form of cancer, accounting for less than 1% of all cancer cases in the UK.\nIt&#8217;s most common in people aged 35 to 39 years and in those aged 70 years or over.\nWomen are 2&nbsp;to 3&nbsp;times more likely to develop thyroid cancer than men. It&#8217;s unclear why this is, but it may be&nbsp;a result of&nbsp;the hormonal changes associated with the female reproductive system.\nIn most cases, the cause of thyroid cancer is unknown. However, certain things can increase your chances of developing the condition.\nRisk factors for thyroid cancer include:\n- having a benign (non-cancerous) thyroid condition\n- having a family history of thyroid cancer (in the case of medullary thyroid cancer)\n- having a bowel condition known as familial adenomatous polyposis\n- acromegaly&nbsp;– a rare condition where the body produces too much growth hormone\n- having a previous benign (non-cancerous) breast condition\n- weight and height\n- radiation exposure&nbsp;\nRead more about the causes of thyroid cancer\nA&nbsp;type of blood test known as a thyroid function test&nbsp;will measure the hormone levels in your blood and rule out or confirm other thyroid problems.\nIf nothing else seems to be causing the lump in your thyroid, fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is used.\nFurther testing may be required if the FNAC results are inconclusive, or if more information is needed to make your treatment more effective.\nRead more about how thyroid cancer is diagnosed.\nYour&nbsp;recommended treatment plan will depend on the type and grade of your cancer, and whether a complete cure is realistically achievable.\nDifferentiated thyroid cancers (DTCs)&nbsp;are treated using a combination of surgery to remove the thyroid gland (thyroidectomy) and a type of&nbsp;radiotherapy that destroys any remaining cancer cells and prevents the thyroid cancer returning.\nMedullary thyroid carcinomas tend to spread faster than DTCs, so it may be necessary to remove any nearby lymph nodes, as well as your thyroid gland.\nRead more about treating thyroid cancer\nCancerous cells will return&nbsp;in an estimated 5% to 20% of people with a history of thyroid cancer. In approximately 10% to 15% of people, the cancerous cells will come back in other parts of their body, such as their bones.\nCancerous cells can sometimes&nbsp;return many years after surgery and radioactive iodine treatment has been completed.&nbsp;\nYou&#8217;ll be asked to attend regular check-ups so any cancerous cells that return can be treated quickly.&nbsp;\nRead more about the complications of thyroid cancer\nFrom the available evidence, eating a&nbsp;healthy, balanced diet is the best way to avoid getting thyroid cancer and all other types of cancer.\nA low-fat, high-fibre diet is recommended that includes plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (at least 5 portions a day) and whole grains.\nIn its early stages, thyroid cancer tends to cause no or very few symptoms.\nThe main symptom of thyroid cancer is a lump or swelling at the front of the neck&nbsp;just below your Adam&#8217;s apple, which is usually painless.\nWomen also have Adam&#8217;s apples, but they&#8217;re&nbsp;much smaller and less prominent&nbsp;than a man&#8217;s.\nThe lymph nodes in your neck can also be affected and become swollen. Lymph nodes are small glands that are part of the lymphatic system, which helps fight infection.\nOther symptoms of thyroid cancer only tend to occur after the condition has reached an advanced stage, and may include:\n- unexplained hoarseness that doesn&#8217;t get better after a few weeks\n- a&nbsp;sore throat or difficulty swallowing that doesn&#8217;t get better\n- pain in your neck\nYou should always speak to your GP if you develop a swelling or lump&nbsp;at the front of your neck. Although it&#8217;s unlikely to be thyroid cancer, it&#8217;s important that&nbsp;it is&nbsp;investigated.\nAbout 1 in 20 swellings or lumps in the neck are caused by thyroid cancer. Most cases are caused by non-cancerous swellings called&nbsp;goitres.\nA&nbsp;goitre is an enlarged thyroid gland. Non-cancerous goitres&nbsp;are usually caused by other less serious problems with your thyroid gland, such as:\n- too much triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) hormones&nbsp;– this is known as having an overactive thyroid gland, or hyperthyroidism\n- not enough T3 and T4 hormones&nbsp;– this is known as having an underactive thyroid gland, or hypothyroidism\nThe Butterfly Thyroid Cancer Trust provides information, advice and support for people with thyroid cancer.\nAs well as the website, they also have a helpline number that can be contacted on&nbsp;01207 545469, Monday to Friday, 10am to 4pm.\nIn most cases, the exact cause of thyroid cancer is unknown.\nHowever, there are certain things that can increase your chances of developing the condition, including having another thyroid condition and being exposed to&nbsp;radiation.\nCancer begins with a change (mutation) in the structure of the DNA in cells, which can affect how they grow. This means cells grow and&nbsp;reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour.\nLeft untreated, cancer can spread to other parts of the body, usually through the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is made up of a network of vessels and glands (lymph nodes) located throughout the body.\nLymph nodes&nbsp;produce many of the cells needed by your immune system (the body&#8217;s natural defence system against infection and illness).\nOnce the cancer reaches your lymphatic system, it&#8217;s capable of spreading to other parts of your body, including your blood, bones and organs.\nThe most common types of thyroid cancer are papillary carcinomas and follicular carcinomas, which are known as differentiated thyroid cancers (DTCs).\nThey spread much more slowly than other types of cancer. When DTCs are diagnosed, they&#8217;re usually limited to the thyroid gland itself or nearby lymph nodes.\nThe rarer types of thyroid cancer are more aggressive and spread faster. By the time medullary thyroid carcinoma is diagnosed, it may have spread to the lymph nodes. In advanced cases, it may have also spread to the bones and lungs.\nAnaplastic thyroid cancer often spreads to the windpipe and, in some cases, the lungs.\nThe main risk factors for developing thyroid cancer are:\n- having a thyroid condition\n- having a family history of thyroid cancer (in the case of medullary thyroid cancer)\n- having a bowel condition known as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)\n- acromegaly (a rare condition where the body produces too much growth hormone)\n- having previous benign (non-cancerous) breast conditions\n- weight and height\n- radiation exposure\nYour risk of developing&nbsp;thyroid cancer is&nbsp;slightly increased if you have certain non-cancerous (benign) thyroid conditions, such as an inflamed thyroid gland&nbsp;(thyroiditis) or an&nbsp;enlarged thyroid gland (goitre).\nHaving an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) or an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) doesn&#8217;t increase your chances of developing thyroid cancer.\nAround 1&nbsp;in 5&nbsp;cases of&nbsp;thyroid cancer occur in people who&#8217;ve had a previous benign thyroid condition.\nInherited genetic mutations are responsible for a small number of medullary thyroid carcinomas. If the instructions carried in genes are altered, some of the body&#8217;s processes won&#8217;t work normally.\nThis inherited mutation occurs in:\n- familial medullary thyroid cancer\n- multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome, types 2A and 2B\nIn cases of MEN2A or MEN2B thyroid cancer, the mutations usually develop during childhood or the teenage years. In familial medullary thyroid cancer, the mutations usually develop in adulthood.\nIf one of your parents has a history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or MEN syndrome, you should consider having a blood test to find out whether you have the mutated genes. If your test results are positive, it&#8217;s recommended you have surgery to remove your thyroid gland as a precaution.\nIf you have a bowel condition called&nbsp;familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), your risk of developing thyroid cancer is increased. FAP runs in families and is caused by inheriting a faulty gene.\nMacmillan Cancer Support have more information about familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).\nThyroid cancer risk is increased in people who have acromegaly.&nbsp;This&nbsp;is a rare condition where the body produces too much growth hormone.\nIf you&#8217;ve had&nbsp;a benign (non-cancerous) breast condition in the past, such as a&nbsp;breast cyst or fibroadenoma (non-cancerous tumour), your&nbsp;risk of developing thyroid cancer&nbsp;increases by around half (50%) compared&nbsp;with women who haven&#8217;t had this type of condition.\nIf you&#8217;re overweight, you&#8217;re more at risk of developing thyroid cancer than someone who isn&#8217;t overweight.\nResearch has&nbsp;also shown that&nbsp;taller adults&nbsp;have&nbsp;an increased risk. However, the reasons for this are unclear.\nExposure to radiation during childhood is another risk factor for thyroid cancer.\nRadiation from nuclear fallout and radiation used for medical treatments have both&nbsp;been associated with thyroid cancer.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nMany recently reported cases of thyroid cancer are thought to have been caused by radiation exposure during medical procedures carried out between 1910 and 1960.\nDuring this time, not much was known about the risks of radiation treatment. Today there are much stricter regulations regarding the use of radiation for medical procedures.\nIf your diet contains low levels of the trace element iodine, you&#8217;re at an&nbsp;increased risk of developing thyroid cancer.\nPeople&nbsp;exposed to radiation, or those with&nbsp;a history of benign thyroid conditions,&nbsp;are more likely to have low levels of iodine.\nEating a lot of butter, cheese and meat may also increase your risk of developing thyroid cancer. To help reduce your risk, you should include plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables in your diet.\nPeople with a high&nbsp;body mass index (BMI) also have an increased risk of developing thyroid cancer.&nbsp;\nWomen are about 2&nbsp;to 3&nbsp;times more likely to develop thyroid cancer than men.\nIt&#8217;s thought this may be&nbsp;because of the&nbsp;hormones released during a woman&#8217;s monthly period or during pregnancy. However, there&#8217;s little scientific evidence to support this theory.\nFor many people, the first stage of diagnosing thyroid cancer is a consultation with a GP.\nYour GP will examine your neck and ask about any associated symptoms you may be experiencing, such as unexplained hoarseness.\nA blood test known as a thyroid function test is used to check whether the swelling in your neck is caused by other problems with your thyroid gland.\nIt will rule out conditions such as an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) or an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism), which are the most common thyroid problems.\nA thyroid function test measures the amount of certain types of hormones in your blood.\nFurther tests will be needed if the thyroid function test reveals your thyroid gland is working normally.\nFine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)&nbsp;is the next stage in diagnosing thyroid cancer. It&#8217;s an outpatient procedure, which means you won&#8217;t have to spend the night in hospital.\nA&nbsp;small needle&nbsp;is inserted into the lump in your neck to allow a tiny sample of cells to be removed. The sample&nbsp;is then&nbsp;studied under a microscope.\nThis test&nbsp;can usually reveal whether cancerous cells are present in your thyroid gland and, if they are, what type of thyroid cancer you have.\nFurther testing may be recommended if the FNAC results are inconclusive or if further information is needed to make your treatment more effective. These tests may include:\n- repeat FNAC combined with an ultrasound scan\n- other types of scan, such as a&nbsp;computerised tomography (CT) scan or&nbsp;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan\nIn most cases, surgery will be recommended to remove the part of the thyroid gland that contains the lump or swelling&nbsp;when it hasn&#8217;t been possible to rule out thyroid cancer.\nIf you&#8217;re diagnosed with thyroid cancer, you&#8217;ll be assigned a care team, who will devise a treatment plan for you.\nYour recommended&nbsp;treatment plan will depend on the type and grade of your cancer, and whether your care team thinks that a complete cure is realistically achievable.\nAll NHS hospitals have multidisciplinary teams (MDTs)&nbsp;that treat thyroid cancer. An MDT is made up of a number of different specialists, and may include:\n- a surgeon\n- an endocrinologist (a specialist in treating hormonal conditions)\n- an oncologist (a cancer treatment specialist)\n- a pathologist (a specialist in diseased tissue)\n- a radiotherapist or clinical oncologist (a specialist in non-surgical methods of treating cancer, such as&nbsp;chemotherapy and radiotherapy)\n- a specialist cancer nurse, who will usually be your&nbsp;first point of contact with the rest of the team\nDeciding on the best course of treatment can be difficult. Your cancer team will make recommendations after reviewing your case, but the final decision will be yours.\nBefore you go to hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may want to write a list of&nbsp;questions to ask&nbsp;the specialist. For example, you may want to find out what the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments are.\nYour recommended treatment will depend on a number of things, including:\n- the type of thyroid cancer you have\n- the grade of your cancer\n- whether your care team thinks&nbsp;a complete cure is realistically achievable\nMost differentiated thyroid cancers&nbsp;– papillary carcinomas and follicular carcinomas&nbsp;– and some medullary thyroid carcinomas have a good prospect of achieving a cure.\nDifferentiated thyroid cancers&nbsp;are treated using a combination of:\n- surgery to remove your thyroid gland (thyroidectomy)\n- a type of radiotherapy called&nbsp;radioactive iodine treatment, which is&nbsp;designed to destroy any remaining cancer cells and prevent the thyroid cancer returning\nMedullary thyroid carcinomas tend to spread faster than differentiated thyroid cancers, so it may be necessary to remove&nbsp;your thyroid gland and any nearby lymph nodes.\nRadiotherapy iodine treatment is not effective&nbsp;at treating this type of thyroid cancer.\nStage 4 medullary thyroid carcinomas aren&#8217;t usually curable, but it should be possible to slow their progression and control any associated symptoms.\nIn most cases of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, a cure isn&#8217;t usually achievable. This is because it&#8217;s usually spread to other parts of the&nbsp;body by the time it&#8217;s been diagnosed.\nRadiotherapy&nbsp;and&nbsp;chemotherapy can be used to slow the progression of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma and help control any symptoms.\nSome cases of differentiated thyroid cancer, medullary thyroid carcinoma and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma may benefit from a new type of treatment known as targeted therapies.\nThis is where medication is used to directly target the cancerous cells. However, these&nbsp;types of treatments are currently undergoing&nbsp;clinical trials and aren&#8217;t offered routinely on the NHS.\nIn almost all cases of thyroid cancer it&#8217;s necessary to either remove some of your thyroid gland in a procedure called a hemithyroidectomy, or all of your thyroid gland&nbsp;(total thyroidectomy).\nThis decision&nbsp;will be influenced by:\n- the type of thyroid cancer you have\n- the size of the tumour\n- whether or not the cancer has spread beyond your thyroid gland\nYour surgeon should discuss with you the type of surgery required and why so&nbsp;you can make an informed decision.\nA thyroidectomy&nbsp;is carried out under a general anaesthetic and usually takes around 2&nbsp;hours. The operation will leave a small scar on your neck, which&nbsp;shouldn&#8217;t be very noticeable. In a small number of cases, it may cause permanent hoarseness.\nMost people are well enough to leave hospital 3&nbsp;to 5&nbsp;days after having thyroid surgery. However, you&#8217;ll need to rest at home for 2&nbsp;to 3&nbsp;weeks and avoid any activities that could put a strain on your neck, such as heavy lifting.\nA member of your care team will be able to advise you about when you&#8217;ll be fit enough to resume normal activities and return to work.\nIf some or all of your thyroid gland is removed, it will no longer be able to produce the hormones that regulate your metabolic system.\nThis means you&#8217;ll experience symptoms of an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism), such as fatigue (extreme tiredness), weight gain and dry skin.\nTo compensate, you&#8217;ll need to take replacement hormone tablets for the rest of your life.\nIf your surgery is to be followed by radioactive iodine treatment, it&#8217;s likely you&#8217;ll be given a hormone tablet called triiodothyronine.\nAfter radioactive iodine treatment is completed, you&#8217;ll be prescribed an alternative hormone tablet called thyroxine, which most people only need to take once a day.\nYou&#8217;ll need to have regular blood tests to check you&#8217;re receiving the right amount of hormones and to determine whether your dose needs to be adjusted.\nIt may take some time to achieve the optimum dose. Until this time, you may experience symptoms of tiredness or weight gain if your hormone levels are too low.\nAlternatively, if your hormone levels are too high, you may experience symptoms such as weight loss, hyperactivity or diarrhoea. You shouldn&#8217;t experience any more side effects once the&nbsp;right dose has been achieved.\nOccasionally, the parathyroid glands can be affected during surgery. The parathyroid glands are located close to the thyroid gland and help regulate the levels of calcium in your blood.\nIf your parathyroid glands are affected, your calcium levels may decrease, which can cause a tingling sensation in your hands, fingers, lips and around your nose.\nThese symptoms should be reported to your MDT or GP as you may need to take calcium supplements. Most people only need to take a short course of calcium tablets&nbsp;as the parathyroid glands will soon start to function normally again.\nAfter having thyroid surgery, a course of radioactive iodine treatment may be recommended. This will&nbsp;help destroy any remaining cancer cells in your body and prevent the cancer returning.\nIf you&#8217;re taking thyroid hormone replacement tablets, you&#8217;ll need to stop taking them for 2 to 4 weeks before having radioactive iodine treatment. This is because they can interfere with the effectiveness of the iodine treatment.\nIf withdrawing your hormone replacement treatment is problematic, you may be given a medicine called recombinant human thyroid stimulating hormone (rhTSH). This is given as an injection on 2 consecutive days.\nYour MDT will be able to advise you about whether or not rhTSH is suitable for you.\nRadioactive iodine treatment involves swallowing radioactive iodine in either liquid or capsule form. The&nbsp;radiation in the iodine travels up into your neck through your blood supply and destroys any cancerous cells.\nSide effects of radioactive iodine treatment are uncommon, but a small number of people may experience tightness, pain or swelling in their neck and may feel flushed (warm). These side effects usually pass within 24 hours.\nAfter treatment, you may have a&nbsp;dry mouth and notice a change in your taste. These symptoms usually disappear after a few weeks or months, although they can be permanent in some people.\nYou&#8217;ll need to stay in hospital for&nbsp;3 to 5 days after the procedure because the iodine will make your body slightly radioactive. As a precaution, you&#8217;ll need to stay in a single room protected by lead sheets so that hospital staff aren&#8217;t exposed to radiation.\nYou won&#8217;t be able to have visitors during this time and hospital staff will keep their contact with you to a minimum.\nYour bodily fluids, such as urine, will also&nbsp;be slightly radioactive for&nbsp;3 to 5 days after your treatment, so it&#8217;s important that you flush the toilet every time you use it. Your sweat will&nbsp;be radioactive, too, so you should&nbsp;bathe or shower every day.\nYou&#8217;ll be allowed home after the radioactive levels in your body have subsided.\nWhile having radioactive iodine treatment, you&#8217;ll need to eat a diet&nbsp;low in iodine. An iodine-rich&nbsp;diet may reduce the effectiveness of your treatment. It&#8217;s recommended that you:\n- avoid all seafood\n- limit the amount of dairy products you eat\n- don&#8217;t take cough medicines or use sea salt&nbsp;as they both contain iodine\nYou should eat plenty of fresh meat, fresh fruit and vegetables,&nbsp;and pasta and rice. These are&nbsp;all low in iodine.\nYou shouldn&#8217;t have radioactive iodine treatment if you&#8217;re pregnant or if there&#8217;s a good chance that you may be. The treatment could damage your baby.\nTell a member of your care team if you&#8217;re unsure whether you&#8217;re pregnant. Any treatment will need to be delayed until after your pregnancy.\nYou must stop breastfeeding before you can be treated with radioactive iodine. If possible, you should stop breastfeeding&nbsp;6 weeks prior to treatment.\nYou should not resume breastfeeding after treatment for your current child, but you may safely breastfeed any babies you may have in the future.\nBreastfeeding also isn&#8217;t recommended while receiving iodine treatment. If you&#8217;re breastfeeding, you should stop at least 4 weeks (but preferably 8) before starting iodine treatment.\nYou should also not&nbsp;resume breastfeeding your baby. However, it&#8217;s safe for you to breastfeed if you have another child in the future.\nYou should&nbsp;use a reliable method of contraception for at least 6 months after having iodine treatment. This is because there&#8217;s a small risk that any child conceived during this time could develop birth defects. This applies to both men and women.\nRadioactive iodine treatment doesn&#8217;t affect fertility in women. However,&nbsp;there&#8217;s a small risk that it could affect fertility in men who need to have multiple treatment sessions. Your&nbsp;care team will be able to advise you about the level of risk in your individual circumstances.\nIf there&#8217;s a&nbsp;significant risk you&#8217;ll become infertile after having radioactive iodine treatment, you may wish to consider having your sperm or eggs harvested and frozen so they can be used for fertility treatment at a later date.\nExternal radiotherapy, where radioactive waves are targeted at affected parts of the body, is usually only used to treat advanced or anaplastic thyroid carcinomas.\nThe length of time you&#8217;ll need to have radiotherapy for will depend on the particular type of thyroid cancer you have and its progression.\nSide effects of radiotherapy include:\n- nausea\n- vomiting\n- tiredness\n- pain when swallowing\n- dry mouth\nThese side effects should pass 2 to 3 weeks after your course of radiotherapy has finished.\nChemotherapy&nbsp;is usually only used to treat anaplastic thyroid carcinomas that have spread to other parts of your body.\nIt&nbsp;involves taking powerful medicines that kill cancerous cells. It&#8217;s rarely successful&nbsp;in curing anaplastic cancer, but can slow its progression and help relieve symptoms.\nPossible side effects of chemotherapy include:\n- nausea\n- vomiting\n- tiredness\n- loss of appetite\n- hair loss&nbsp;\n- mouth ulcers&nbsp;\nIf you&#8217;re receiving chemotherapy, you&#8217;ll also be more vulnerable to infection. See your GP if you suddenly feel ill or your temperature rises above 38C (100.4F).\nA number of targeted therapies are being tested in&nbsp;clinical trials to treat advanced cases of:\n- medullary thyroid cancers\n- differentiated thyroid cancers that don&#8217;t respond to radioactive iodine\n- anaplastic thyroid carcinomas\nIn targeted therapies, medication specifically targets the biological functions that cancers need to grow and spread.\nAs research is ongoing, some medications used in this type of treatment are unlicensed. In exceptional circumstances, your specialist may suggest using an unlicensed medication. They&#8217;ll do this if:\n- they think it&#8217;s likely to be effective\n- there are no better alternatives\n- the benefits of treatment outweigh any associated risks\nIf your specialist is considering prescribing an unlicensed medication, they&#8217;ll tell you that it&#8217;s unlicensed and will discuss the possible risks and benefits with you.\nThe decision about whether to fund treatment with medications used in targeted therapies is often made by individual&nbsp;clinical commissioning groups (CCGs).&nbsp;\nCancerous cells can return many years after surgery and radioactive iodine treatment has been completed.\nIt&#8217;s&nbsp;estimated that 5% to 20% of people with a history of thyroid cancer will experience a return of cancerous cells in their neck.\nAn estimated 10% to 15% of people will&nbsp;see a return of cancerous cells in other parts of their body, such as their bones.\nBecause of&nbsp;the risk of cancer cells returning, you&#8217;ll be asked to attend regular check-ups so any cancerous cells that do return can be treated quickly.\nThyroglobulin testing is a special type of blood test that&#8217;s used to monitor some types of thyroid cancer and to check for the return of cancerous cells.\nThyroglobulin is a protein released by a healthy thyroid gland, but it can also be released by cancerous cells.\nIf you&#8217;ve had your thyroid gland removed, there should be no thyroglobulin present in your blood, unless cancerous cells have returned.\nRegularly testing your blood for thyroglobulin can be an effective way of checking whether or not any cancerous cells have returned.\nFor the first few years after having surgery you&#8217;ll probably need to have thyroglobulin testing every 6 months. After this period, you&#8217;ll need to be tested once a year.\nAn ultrasound scanner uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of part of the inside of the body. An&nbsp;ultrasound scan&nbsp;can detect changes inside your neck that could indicate the recurrence of cancer.\nAfter&nbsp;surgery to remove part or all of your thyroid gland, you may be asked to attend a radioactive iodine scanning test.\nYou swallow a small amount of radioactive iodine before undergoing a scan. The radioactive iodine will highlight any cancerous thyroid cells in the body.\nBefore the scan, you&#8217;ll need to go on a low-iodine diet and stop taking your thyroid hormone medication.\nAs&nbsp;only a small&nbsp;dose of radioactive iodine&nbsp;is used, it&#8217;s not necessary to&nbsp;keep your distance from others. However, if you think you may be pregnant or you&#8217;re breastfeeding, let the doctors know before your test.\nA radioactive iodine scan will&nbsp;usually be carried out&nbsp;6 to 8 months after surgery."

        "description": "This section is for teens and young adults. It’s about a type of cancer called thyroid cancer.\nIf you’re looking for information about thyroid cancer in people of all ages, read our&nbsp;thyroid cancer section.\nPapillary and follicular thyroid cancers are the most common types of thyroid cancer in young adults. If you&#8217;d like to find out about a different type of thyroid cancer you could talk to Macmillan Cancer Support.\nIt’s important to remember that thyroid cancer in young people can be successfully treated. Most young people are completely cured.\nThe first sign of thyroid cancer is usually a painless lump or swelling in the front of the neck that gradually gets bigger.\nLess common symptoms are:\n- a hoarse voice that doesn&#8217;t get better\n- difficulty swallowing or breathing\nIf you have any of these symptoms, it&#8217;s important to speak to a doctor.\nRemember – these symptoms can happen for lots of reasons other than cancer.\nIt&#8217;s unknown exactly what causes thyroid cancer. But research into possible causes is going on all the time. Some things called risk factors increase your chance of developing cancer. But having these doesn’t mean you’ll get cancer.\nGenes are the biological information in each cell that we inherit from our parents. Genes affect the way we look (for example, our eye colour) and how our bodies grow and work. Some rare genetic conditions that run in families can increase the risk of thyroid cancer. But fewer than 1 in 10 cases of cancer are caused by an inherited faulty gene.\nIf you were exposed to radiation or had&nbsp;radiotherapy treatment to the neck area when you were younger, you may be at a higher risk of developing thyroid cancer many years later.\nIf you think you might have some of these symptoms you should go straight to your GP. They&#8217;ll be able to talk to you about your symptoms. If they think the symptoms could be because of cancer, they can do&nbsp;tests to find out more.\nThe thyroid is a small gland in the front of the neck just below the voice box (larynx). It is made up of 2 parts, or lobes, 1 on each side of the neck. It&#8217;s part of a network of glands throughout the body that make up the endocrine system. This system is responsible for producing the body’s hormones that help to control and influence various body functions.\nThe thyroid produces 2 hormones:\n- thyroid hormone that controls your metabolism\n- calcitonin that helps to control the calcium levels in your body\nThere are 4 main types of thyroid cancer:\n- papillary is the most common type of thyroid cancer&nbsp;– it’s usually slow-growing\n- follicular is the second most common type – it&#8217;s also usually slow-growing\n- medullary is a rare type of thyroid cancer which sometimes runs in families\n- anaplastic is another rare type of thyroid cancer, which is more common in older people\nYoung people are mostly affected by the papillary and follicular types.\nRarely other types of cancer occur in the thyroid gland such as lymphoma, or other cancers that have spread from another part of the body.\nThis section is for teens and young adults. It’s about a type of cancer called thyroid cancer.\nIf you’re looking for information about thyroid cancer in people of all ages, read our&nbsp;thyroid cancer section.\nThis information is for teenagers and young adults who may be having tests to find out if they have thyroid cancer.\nIf you think you might have some of the symptoms of thyroid cancer, you should talk to your GP. If they think the symptoms could be because of cancer, they can do tests to find out more.\nWhen you go to your GP they will usually examine you and arrange some blood tests. There may be a number of reasons why you have these symptoms. If your GP is concerned that you may have thyroid cancer they will make an appointment for you with a specialist at the hospital.\nYou’ll probably be seen by lots of people at the hospital during and after the tests they do to find out what is happening to you. They work as a team and all have an important part in your care, even though you may only meet some of them.\nThey may include:\n- a doctor who specialises in thyroid problems (endocrinologist)\n- a surgeon who specialises in thyroid surgery\n- a pathologist who looks at blood and tissue samples to diagnose diseases\n- a cancer specialist (oncologist)\n- an X-ray specialist (radiologist)\n- a clinical nurse specialist\nYour doctor will examine you and arrange for more detailed tests, which may include an ultrasound, a fine needle aspiration (FNA) or a biopsy.\nAn FNA involves having a very small needle placed into your thyroid gland to remove a few cells for the pathologist to look at under the microscope.\nA biopsy involves removing a small piece of the thyroid to be analysed. You might have a general anaesthetic and so will be asleep when it is done. You may only need a local anaesthetic, which numbs the area. There is more information about having an anaesthetic in the surgery section.\nIf the biopsy shows that it is thyroid cancer you will have some other tests to check the size of the tumour and whether it has spread. Macmillan Cancer Support has information on these tests. These tests may include:\n- a chest\n- X-ray to check your lungs\n- a CT, MRI or PET&nbsp;scan\n- a radioisotope scan\nYou won’t necessarily need all of these tests. It will depend on the results of the first ones.\nHaving tests and waiting for the results can be an anxious time. Talking about how you feel and getting support from your family, friends, specialist nurse or doctor can help.\nIf you&#8217;re looking for information about thyroid cancer in people of all ages, read our general&nbsp;thyroid cancer information.\nIt’s important to remember that thyroid cancer in young people can be successfully treated. Most young people are completely cured. If the&nbsp;tests&nbsp;you’ve had show you have thyroid cancer, your team of specialists will discuss treatment with you.\nSurgery to remove the thyroid gland is the main treatment for thyroid cancer. You might hear the doctors talk about a thyroidectomy, which is the medical name for the operation. Sometimes the surgeon will only need to remove part of your thyroid.\nIn the neck, close to the thyroid,&nbsp;there are lymph nodes. These are part of the body’s immune system and help fight infection. Sometimes cancer cells settle in these lymph nodes, so the surgeon might remove some or all of the nodes as well. They may also remove some tissue from the area around the thyroid if they suspect that there are any cancer cells there.\nYou will probably need to spend a few days in hospital after the operation. There will be a scar on your neck – usually just above the collarbone. Sometimes you can have a low calcium level in your blood or a hoarse voice after the operation. You may need to take tablets to replace the thyroid hormone.\nThe tissue removed will be carefully looked at under the microscope. Sometimes another operation is needed after this. The results will help your doctors decide if you need radioactive iodine treatment and other treatments. Your team will talk through the results of the operation with you.\nYou may feel really shocked and scared by the thought of having this operation. But it does give a really good chance of a cure. Your specialist will talk things over with you in detail and make sure that you fully understand what’s involved. If you want to know more about what happens when you go in for an operation, there’s lots more information in the general&nbsp;surgery section.\nIf you’ve been told that you need to have treatment with radioactive iodine, you may be worried about what’s going to happen. Knowing what to expect can help.\nYour doctors and nurses will also explain things to you and give you support.\nThere&#8217;s&nbsp;a mineral called iodine in the bloodstream. Normal thyroid tissue takes iodine from the bloodstream and uses it to make thyroid hormones. Some thyroid cancers can take iodine from the bloodstream too.\nRadioactive iodine is often used after surgery when the whole thyroid gland has been removed. Any thyroid cancer cells left behind soak up the iodine which contains high doses of radiation. This helps to destroy them. Radioactive iodine doesn’t usually affect other parts of the body because other cells don’t take up iodine the way thyroid cells do.\nYou may have radioactive iodine as a capsule, as a drink or as an injection into a vein in your arm through a cannula.\nThere are 2 ways to prepare your body for the radioiodine treatment, either you&#8217;ll:\n- be given an injection of a drug called thyrotropin alfa (Thyrogen®)\n- need to stop taking your thyroid hormone tablets 2 to 4 weeks before the treatment\nSome people won’t be started on thyroid hormones until after surgery and radioactive iodine treatment. You’ll probably feel very tired during this time. But, if you are not having the injections, it’s important that you stop taking thyroid hormones or the radioactive iodine treatment won’t work.\nFor 2 weeks before treatment, you’ll be asked to eat a low-iodine diet and avoid certain foods. This encourages the body to use up its stores of iodine. Then when the radioactive iodine is given, the cancer cells will soak it up because the amount of iodine in the body is so low. You’ll be given information about what foods you should eat and what to avoid.\nYou can’t have this treatment if you are pregnant. If there is any chance of this tell your team and they can test you.\nThis treatment makes you slightly radioactive for several weeks. Your body will gradually get rid of the radioactivity through your wee, sweat and saliva. You will be kept in hospital when the radioactivity is highest, which is usually between 1&nbsp;to 5 days. You will be looked after in a side room on the ward, either on your own or with someone else having the same treatment.\nDuring this treatment, the amount of contact you can have with your friends, family and the nurses will be limited, to protect them from exposure to the radiation. Anyone pregnant or younger than 18 usually isn’t allowed to visit. This can make you feel lonely. You will be able to keep in touch with your friends and family by phone and internet. There should be plenty of books, magazines, DVDs, computer games and a TV in the room. You can take in a few of your own things in to help pass the time. Ask your team whether you can take a computer or an MP3 player into the room with you. Anything that comes back out of your room will be checked for radiation levels. Sometimes your things may have to be kept on the ward for a while if the radiation levels are high. But they’ll be returned to you when they’re safe again.\nOnce your radiation levels are safe, you’ll be allowed home. You’ll also be able to start eating your usual foods again. Check with the staff about what you can and can’t do when you get home. There are likely to be some precautions to take for up to a few weeks.\nYou might need a scan shortly after your treatment. This shows if you need more radioiodine treatment. If you need more treatment it is usually given every 3&nbsp;to 6 months.\nYour fertility won’t be affected by the treatment. But it’s safer not to become pregnant or get someone else pregnant during treatment, and for a year after. You should avoid all sex and open-mouthed kissing for a few days after treatment.\nTravelling on public transport can be restricted just after treatment, so you may not be able to go on holiday just after treatment. For a few months after treatment you might set off the alarms at the security gates. If you are planning a holiday, discuss it with your team.\nYou may also have external beam radiotherapy. For this treatment you come to hospital and lie on a bed in the radiotherapy department for about 10 to 20 minutes every day. You will have treatment every weekday for several weeks. It is like having an X-ray, so it doesn’t hurt and you cannot feel it.&nbsp;\nIf you’ve had all your thyroid gland removed, your body can’t produce thyroid hormones anymore. Without these hormones, your metabolism slows down. This can cause dry skin and hair, tiredness, poor concentration and lack of energy.\nThese hormones can be replaced by taking tablets. You’ll need to take them for the rest of your life. The usual long-term hormone treatment is thyroxine (levothyroxine) and you normally start taking it once your radioactive iodine treatment is finished.\nAs well as replacing the hormones you’re missing, thyroxine can also help stop papillary or follicular thyroid cancer coming back. So if you have only had part of your thyroid gland removed you may still need to take thyroid hormone tablets.\nYou’ll need to have your blood checked regularly to monitor the hormone levels. It can sometimes take months to find the right dose of thyroxine for you. But once the right dose is found, there shouldn’t be any side effects, because they are simply replacing normal thyroid hormones.\nIt’s important to remember to take your tablets every day. It can help to take them at the same time every day so you get into a routine.\nMacmillan Cancer Support has more general information about cancer treatments like radiotherapy and surgery. This information is written for people of all ages, not just young adults with thyroid cancer.\nThis information is for teenagers and young adults and is about having treatment for thyroid cancer.\nIf you&#8217;re looking for information about thyroid cancer in people of all ages,&nbsp;read our&nbsp;thyroid cancer information."

They feed on the blood of birds and mammals, including humans.\nTicks vary in size and are usually between 1mm to 1cm long. They have either 6 or 8 legs.\nTicks feed from a variety of mammals and birds, including squirrels, deer, sheep and garden birds. This means they’re usually found in areas with these animals, like:\n- woodland\n- moorland\n- grassy areas\n- gardens\n- parks\nTicks don’t fly or jump but climb on to animals or humans as they brush past.\nTick season is usually between March and October but it may last longer. This is because wet weather and warmer temperatures make ticks active for longer in the year.\nYou should be aware of ticks all year round. This is because some symptoms of a tick bite, including inflammation, can take 2 to 3 months to develop.\nTick bites aren’t usually painful but they may cause a red lump to develop where you were bitten.\nIn some cases, tick bites may cause:\n- swelling\n- itchiness\n- blistering\n- bruising\nComplete our self-help guide to check your symptoms and find out what to do next.\nIf you’ve been bitten by a tick, it will attach to your skin. You should try to remove it as soon as possible. This helps to reduce the risk of getting a tick-borne infection, like Lyme disease. This is a bacterial infection that causes a pink or red circular rash to develop around the area of the bite.\nYou should:\nMany pharmacies and outdoor stores sell tick removal devices. These are useful if you often spend time in areas where there are ticks.\nIf the tick’s mouthparts break off in the skin and can not be removed, this may cause irritation. But, they should fall out naturally in time.\nLyme disease is only transmitted from the mouth of a tick directly to the bloodstream of its host. This means you don’t need to disinfect clothing that has a tick on it.\nYou should remove any ticks from yourself or your clothing before washing.\nYou can remove a tick from your clothing or any other fabric (like a carpet or bedding) using tweezers. You could then tightly wrap the tick in tape and put it in an outside bin.\nOnce you&#8217;ve removed a tick, monitor the area where you were bitten. You do not need to speak to your GP if you’ve been bitten and have no symptoms.\nA small number of ticks carry the bacteria that can cause Lyme disease. Being bitten doesn’t mean you’ll definitely be infected. But, it’s important to be aware of the risk and speak to a GP if you start to feel unwell.\nMore about Lyme disease\nIf you&#8217;ve been in an area where you could have been bitten by a tick and you have:\n&copy; 2025 NHS 24 &#8211; v1.1.1.17852"

You might hear:\n- buzzing\n- humming\n- grinding\n- hissing\n- whistling\n- music or singing\n- noises that beat in time with your pulse\nYou may also notice hearing loss or that you’re more sensitive to everyday sounds.\nFor some people, tinnitus may come and go. But sometimes it can impact your daily life and be very distressing. It can affect concentration and cause difficulty sleeping (insomnia) and depression.\nTinnitus will sometimes get better over time, either by disappearing or by the body getting used to it.\nYour doctor can examine your ears to see if the problem might be caused by a condition they could easily treat, such as an ear infection or earwax build-up. They can also check if you have any hearing loss.\nIf needed, your GP can refer you to a specialist for further tests and treatment.\nTinnitus can develop slowly over time or happen suddenly.\nIt’s not known exactly why it happens but it&#8217;s often linked to:\n- hearing loss\n- inner ear damage caused by repeated exposure to loud noises or some medicines\n- an earwax build-up\n- a middle ear infection\n- Ménière’s disease – a condition that also causes hearing loss and vertigo (a spinning sensation)\n- otosclerosis – an inherited condition where an abnormal bone growth in the middle ear causes hearing loss\nMost people have tinnitus for a short time after being exposed to loud noises, such as after a music concert.\nAround 1 in 10 people have persistent tinnitus. Around 1 in 100 having severe tinnitus that affects their daily life.\nTinnitus can affect people of all ages, including children.

In young children, they help to fight germs and act as a barrier against infection.\nWhen the tonsils become infected, they stop it spreading further into the body.\nAs a child’s immune system gets stronger, the tonsils become less important and usually get smaller. In most people, the body is able to fight infection without the tonsils.\nComplete our self-help guide to check your symptoms and find out what to do next.\nThe symptoms of tonsillitis include:\n- a sore throat\n- pain when swallowing\n- earache\n- high temperature (fever) over 38°C (100.4°F)\n- coughing\n- headache\n- feeling sick\n- feeling tired\n- swollen, painful lymph glands in your neck\n- white pus-filled spots on the tonsils\n- bad breath\n- loss of voice or changes to your voice\nSymptoms usually get better within 3 to 4 days.\nIf your GP practice is closed, phone 111.\nIf needed, your GP will examine your throat and ask you some questions about your symptoms. They may take a swab of your throat to check if its caused by a viral or bacterial infection. It&#8217;ll usually take a few days to get your results.\nIf you develop severe tonsillitis as a teenager or adult, your GP may recommend a blood test for glandular fever.\nThere’s no specific treatment for tonsillitis. It usually gets better on its own within a week.\nAlways read the leaflet that comes with your medicine before taking it. Follow the recommended dosage instructions. If you’re not sure which treatments are suitable for you or your child, speak to a pharmacist for advice.\nIf test results show that your tonsillitis is caused by a bacterial infection, a short course of oral antibiotics may be prescribed.\nIf oral antibiotics do not help and your symptoms are getting worse, your GP may refer you to hospital for antibiotics to be given into a vein (IV antibiotics).\nA small number of children and adults have tonsillitis for longer, or it keeps returning. This is called chronic tonsillitis and surgery may be needed.\nSurgery to remove the tonsils (a tonsillectomy) is usually only recommended if:\n- you’ve had several severe episodes of tonsillitis over a long period of time\n- repeated episodes are disrupting normal activities\nMost cases of tonsillitis are caused by a viral infection, such as cold or flu.\nSome cases can also be caused by a bacterial infection, typically a strain of bacteria called group A streptococcus bacteria.\nTonsillitis itself isn’t contagious, but the infections that cause it are.\nComplications of tonsillitis are rare and usually only occur if it’s caused by a bacterial infection. They’re usually the result of the infection spreading to another part of the body.\nPossible complications of tonsillitis include:\n- quinsy (peritonsillar abscess) – an abscess (collection of pus) that develops between one of the tonsils and the wall of the throat\n- obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) – where the walls of the throat relax during sleep, which causes breathing difficulties and poor sleep\nOther complications of tonsillitis are very rare. They usually only occur if an underlying bacterial infection is left untreated."

        "disease": "Tooth decay",
        "description": "Tooth decay can occur when acid is produced by plaque, which builds up on your teeth. This causes holes or cavities in teeth (dental caries).\nIf untreated, decay progresses and can cause abscesses (collections of pus at the end of the teeth or in the gums). Plaque is also involved in gum disease.\nIf plaque is allowed to build up, it can lead to further problems, such as:\n- dental caries (holes in the teeth)\n- gum disease\n- dental abscesses (collections of pus at the end of the teeth or in the gums)\nTooth decay may not cause any pain. However, if you have dental caries you might have:\n- toothache – either continuous pain keeping you awake or occasional sharp pain without an obvious cause\n- tooth sensitivity – you may feel tenderness or pain when eating or drinking something hot, cold or sweet\n- grey, brown or black spots appearing on your teeth\n- bad breath\n- an unpleasant taste in your mouth\nVisit your dentist regularly, so early tooth decay can be treated as soon as possible and the prevention of decay can begin. Tooth decay is much easier and cheaper to treat in its early stages. Dentists can usually identify tooth decay and further problems with a simple examination or X-ray.\nIt&#8217;s also important to have regular dental check-ups. Adults should have a check-up anywhere between 3 months to 2 years depending on their needs.\nTake your child to the dental practice routinely as advised by your dental team\nRead more on getting over a fear of the dentist\nTreatment of tooth decay depends on how advanced it is.\nFor early stage tooth decay, your dentist will talk to you about the amount of sugar in your diet and the times you eat. They may apply a fluoride gel, varnish or paste to the area. Fluoride helps to protect teeth by strengthening the enamel, making teeth more resistant to the acids from plaque that can cause tooth decay.\nFor more advanced decay,&nbsp; your dentist may discuss a filling or crown with you. This involves removing the dental decay, offering local anaesthetic to numb the tooth and filling the hole.\nIf tooth decay has spread to the pulp (in the centre of the tooth, containing blood and nerves) it may be removed in a process known as root canal treatment.\nIf the tooth is so badly damaged that it can&#8217;t be restored, it may need to be removed. Your dentist may be able to replace the tooth with a partial denture or bridge.\nNHS charges are set by the government and are standard for all NHS patients.\nSome people don&#8217;t have to pay for dental treatment, including everyone aged under 26, and people who are pregnant or have given birth in the last 12 months. Financial help may also be available to those on a low income&nbsp;or in receipt of certain benefits.\nThe cost of private dental treatment varies between practices, as there is no set charge. If you choose to see have private dental care, make sure to agree the cost before having treatment.\nFurther information about cost of NHS treatment\nAlthough tooth decay is a common problem, it&#8217;s often entirely preventable. The best way to avoid tooth decay is to keep your teeth and gums as healthy as possible.\n\n- visit your dentist regularly &ndash; your dentist will decide how often they need to see you based on the condition of your mouth, teeth and gums\n- cut down on sugary food and drinks, particularly between meals or within an hour of going to bed &ndash; some medications can also contain sugar, so it&#8217;s best to look for sugar-free alternatives where possible\n- look after your teeth and gums &ndash; brushing your teeth properly with a fluoride toothpaste twice a day, using interdental brushes or floss daily\n- avoid smoking or drinking alcohol excessively &ndash; tobacco can interfere with saliva production, which helps to keep your teeth clean, and alcohol can contribute to the erosion of tooth enamel\n- see your dentist or GP if you have a persistently dry mouth &ndash; this may be caused by certain medicines, treatment or medical conditions\n\nGood eating habits by limiting sugary snacks and drinks can help your child avoid tooth decay. Regular visits to the dentist at an early age should also be encouraged.\nToothbrushing\nYou should start brushing your child’s teeth and gums daily as soon as their first tooth grows in.\nFind out more about toothbrushing for babies, toddlers and pre-schoolers\nChildsmile&nbsp;has advice for keeping children’s teeth healthy:\n- under 3s\n- 3 to 5 year olds\n- 5 to 12 year olds\nChildren should still brush their teeth twice a day, especially before bedtime.\nYour mouth is full of bacteria that form a film over the teeth called dental plaque.\nWhen you consume food and drink high in sugars, the bacteria in plaque turn the sugars into energy they need, producing acid at the same time.\nIf the plaque is allowed to build up, the acid can begin to break down (dissolve) the surface of your tooth, causing holes known as cavities.\nOnce cavities have formed in the enamel, the plaque and bacteria can reach the dentine (the softer, bone-like material underneath the enamel). As the dentine is softer than the enamel, the process of tooth decay speeds up.\nWithout treatment, bacteria will enter the pulp (the soft centre of the tooth that contains nerves and blood vessels). At this stage, your nerves will be exposed to bacteria, usually making your tooth painful.\nThe bacteria can cause a dental abscess in the pulp and the infection could spread into the bone."

        "disease": "Toothache",
        "description": "Toothache is pain in and around the teeth and jaws. It&#8217;s usually caused by tooth decay.\nYou can feel toothache in many ways. It can come and go or be constant. Eating or drinking can make the pain worse, particularly if the food or drink is hot or cold.\nThe pain can also be mild or severe. It might feel sharp and start suddenly. It can be worse at night, particularly when you&#8217;re lying down. A lost filling or broken tooth can sometimes start the pain.\nIt can also sometimes be difficult to decide whether the pain is in your upper or lower teeth. When a lower molar tooth is affected, the pain can often feel like it&#8217;s coming from the ear.\nToothache in other upper teeth may feel like it&#8217;s coming from the sinuses, the small, air-filled cavities behind your cheekbones and forehead.\nThe area of your jaw close to the infected tooth may also be sore and tender to touch.\nIt&#8217;s also possible for periodontal disease to give rise to a dull pain. Periodontal disease is a bacterial infection that affects the soft and hard structures that support the teeth.\n\n- you have toothache for more than 1 or 2 days\n \nThe longer you leave it, the worse it will get.\n\nIf your toothache isn&#8217;t treated, the pulp inside your tooth can become infected. This may lead to a dental abscess, with severe and continuous throbbing pain.\nPainkillers, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen, may reduce the pain and discomfort while you&#8217;re waiting for an appointment. Children under 16 years of age shouldn&#8217;t be given aspirin.\nToothache occurs when the innermost layer of the tooth (dental pulp) becomes inflamed. The pulp is made up of sensitive nerves and blood vessels.\nDental pulp can become inflamed as a result of:\n- tooth decay – this leads to holes (cavities) forming in the hard surface of the tooth\n- a cracked tooth – the crack is often so small that it can&#8217;t be seen with the naked eye\n- loose or broken fillings\n- receding gums – where the gums shrink (contract) to expose softer, more sensitive parts of the tooth root\n- periapical abscess – a collection of pus at the end of the tooth caused by a bacterial infection\nThere are other conditions that can cause pain similar to toothache, even though the pulp isn&#8217;t affected. These include:\n- periodontal abscess – a collection of pus in the gums caused by a bacterial infection\n- ulcers on your gums\n- sore or swollen gums around a tooth that&#8217;s breaking through – for example, when your wisdom teeth start to come through\n- sinusitis – which sometimes causes pain around the upper jaw\n- an injury to the joint that attaches the jaw to the skull (temporomandibular joint)\nBabies can also experience discomfort when their teeth start to develop. This is known as teething.\nThe type of treatment you have for toothache will depend on the cause of the pain. Your dentist will examine your mouth and may carry out an X-ray to try to identify the problem.\nIf your toothache is caused by tooth decay, your dentist will remove the decayed area and replace it with a filling.\nIf your toothache is caused by a loose or broken filling, the filling will be taken out, any decay will be removed, and a new filling put in place.\nIf the pulp inside your tooth is infected, you may need root canal treatment. This procedure involves removing the infected pulp and then inserting a special type of filling to seal the tooth and prevent reinfection.\nYour tooth may need to be removed if the toothache can&#8217;t be treated using these methods or the tooth is wedged between another tooth and your jaw (impacted).\nThe best way to avoid getting toothache and other dental problems is to keep your teeth and gums as healthy as possible.\n\n- limit your intake of sugary foods and drinks &#8211; you should have these as an occasional treat and only at meal times\n- brush your teeth twice a day using a toothpaste that contains fluoride &ndash; gently brush your gums and tongue as well\n- clean between your teeth using interdental brushes or dental floss\n- stop smoking &ndash; it can make some dental problems worse\n\nMake sure you have regular dental check-ups, ideally with the same dentist. The time between check-ups can vary, depending on how healthy your teeth and gums are and your risk of developing future problems.\nYour dentist will suggest when you should have your next check-up based on your overall oral health.\nRead more about taking care of your teeth and keeping your teeth clean.\n"

        "description": "Tourette&#8217;s syndrome is a neurological condition that causes you to make involuntary movements and sounds called tics.\nTics are fast, repetitive muscle movements that cause sudden body jerks or sounds.\nThe main symptoms of Tourette&#8217;s syndrome are tics. There are different types of tic.\nMotor tics might include:\n- eye blinking\n- neck and head jerks\n- arm and leg movements\n- pinching\n- kicking\n- hitting\n- falling to the ground\nVocal tics might include:\n- throat clearing\n- grunting\n- sniffing\n- coughing\n- repeating words or phrases\n- animal sounds\n- stuttering\n- singing\nSwearing is a rare tic that affects a small number of people with Tourette&#8217;s syndrome.\nChildren often have tics for several months before growing out of them. These are known as transient tics. Having a tic does not necessarily mean your child has Tourette&#8217;s syndrome.\nSome people with Tourette&#8217;s syndrome feel a strong urge before a tic. This urge is described as a similar feeling to before you need to sneeze or itch.\nThis feeling is called a premonitory sensation or urge. It&#8217;s only relieved after the tic has been carried out.\nPremonitory sensations can include:\n- a dry or sore throat before grunting\n- a burning feeling in the eyes before blinking\n- an itchy joint or muscle before jerking\nSome people can control or suppress their tics for a short while in certain social situations like in a classroom. This requires concentration and effort but can get easier with practise. This is called suppressibility.\nIt can be tiring to try to control tics. You might have a sudden intense release of tics when&nbsp;you get home if you&#8217;ve been controlling them all day while in school or work, for example.\nTics might be less noticeable when you&#8217;re concentrating on a certain activity like reading a book or playing sports. Sometimes tics might be more noticeable when you&#8217;re relaxing.\nTics are not normally harmful but physical tics can be painful.\nThere are times when tics can become worse. Tics might be triggered by:\n- stress\n- anxiety\n- excitement\n- sensory overload\n- feeling nervous\n- confrontation\n- fatigue (tiredness)\nTourette&#8217;s syndrome often comes with other health conditions like:\n- attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\n- obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)\n- depression or anxiety\nThe cause of Tourette&#8217;s syndrome is unknown.\nIt&#8217;s not known why more males are likely to be affected by Tourette&#8217;s syndrome than females.\nSometimes tics run in families.\nThere&#8217;s no single test for Tourette&#8217;s syndrome. You might be offered tests and scans like an MRI scan to rule out other conditions. You can be diagnosed with Tourette&#8217;s syndrome at any age.\nYou might be diagnosed with Tourette&#8217;s syndrome if you&#8217;ve had several movement and sound tics for at least a year and these started before you turned 18 years of age.\nYour GP might refer you to different specialists to help get a diagnosis. For example, a psychiatrist or neurologist. A neurologist is a doctor who specialises in conditions affecting the brain and nervous system.\nGetting a confirmed diagnosis can help you and others understand your condition. It can also allow you to access treatment and support.\nThere&#8217;s no cure for Tourette&#8217;s syndrome. Most children with tics do not need treatment for them. Tics can significantly improve or disappear altogether as patients move into their early 20s. However, some people find their tics continue or worsen in adulthood.\nTreatment might be recommended to help you control your tics. There are treatment options available through the NHS.\nTreating associated health conditions like OCD, depression or anxiety can help improve tics.\nThis includes different types of behavioural therapy available to help reduce tics like:\n- habit reversal training – involves identifying the triggers that cause tics then find an another way of relieving the urge to tic\n- exposure with response prevention (ERP) – trains you to control your urge to tic tolerating the feeling without doing the tic until the urge passes\nIf your tics are more severe and affect your daily activities, you might benefit from medicine to help treat your tics.\nMedicines for Tourette&#8217;s syndrome don&#8217;t help everyone and can cause side effects."

        "disease": "Transient ischaemic attack (TIA)",
        "description": "A transient ischaemic attack (TIA), or mini stroke, happens when there&#8217;s a temporary disruption in the blood supply to part of the brain.\nThe disruption in blood supply results in a lack of oxygen to the brain. This can cause sudden symptoms like those of a stroke.\nHowever, a TIA does not last as long as a stroke. The effects only last for a few minutes or hours and fully resolve within 24 hours.\nDo not drive if you suspect you have had a stroke or TIA (transient ischaemic attack).\nLike a stroke, the signs and symptoms of a TIA usually begin suddenly.\nThe main symptoms of stroke can be remembered with the word FAST.\nFAST stands for:\n- Face – the face might drop on one side, the person may not be able to smile or their mouth may have dropped, and their eyelid may droop\n- Arms – the person may not be able to lift both arms and keep them there because of arm weakness or numbness in one arm\n- Speech – they might slur their speech or it might be garbled, or the person may not be able to talk at all despite appearing to be awake\n- Time – it’s time to phone 999 immediately if you see any of these signs or symptoms\nIt’s important to be aware of the symptoms of a stroke or TIA, especially if you live with or care for somebody in a high-risk group, like an elderly person or someone with diabetes or high blood pressure.\nA person having a TIA or a stroke might not have all of these symptoms. If you notice any of these symptoms, you should consider a person may be having a stroke.\nSymptoms in the FAST test identify most strokes and TIAs. TIAs sometimes cause different symptoms that appear suddenly, usually over a few seconds.\nOther signs and symptoms may include:\n- complete paralysis of one side of the body\n- sudden loss or blurring of vision\n- dizziness\n- confusion\n- difficulty understanding what others are saying\n- problems with balance and co-ordination\nHowever, there may be other causes for these symptoms.\nDuring a TIA, it’s not possible to tell whether you’re having a TIA or a full stroke, so it’s important to phone 999 immediately. Even if the symptoms disappear, you should still have an urgent assessment by a health professional.\nA TIA is a warning that you’re at risk of having a full stroke. An assessment can help doctors decide the best way to reduce the chances of this happening.\nTIAs happen when there is a temporary disruption in the blood supply to part of the brain.\nIn TIAs, the blockage resolves before any significant damage. A full stroke disrupts the blood flow to your brain for much longer. This leads to more severe damage to the brain and longer-term problems.\nThe blockage responsible for most TIAs is usually caused by a blood clot that has travelled to the blood vessels supplying the brain.\nA type of irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation can also cause TIAs. It can create blood clots that escape from the heart and become stuck in the blood vessels that supply the brain.\nThere are some things that can make you more likely to have a stroke or TIA:\n- poor diet\n- lack of exercise\n- obesity\n- smoking\n- an excessive alcohol intake\n- high cholesterol\n- high blood pressure (hypertension)\n- diabetes\n- atrial fibrillation\nThere are lifestyle changes you can make to help control some of these risk factors. You may also need to take regular medication.\nTaking anticoagulant medication if you have an irregular heartbeat due to atrial fibrillation will help reduce the risk of stroke.\nIf you’ve had a stroke or TIA, these measures are particularly important because you’re more likely to have another stroke in future.\nThere are some risk factors you can’t change like:\n- age – people over 65 are most at risk of having strokes, although they can happen at any age – including in children\n- family history – if a close relative (parent, grandparent, brother or sister) has had a stroke, your risk is likely to be higher\n- ethnicity – if you’re south Asian, African or Caribbean, your risk of stroke is higher, partly because rates of diabetes and high blood pressure are higher in these groups\n- your medical history – if you’ve had a stroke, transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or heart attack, your risk of stroke is higher\nYou should have an assessment by a health professional as soon as possible if you think you’ve had a TIA.\nTIAs are often over very quickly, so you may not have any symptoms by the time you see a health professional.\nYou should tell the person assessing you about the symptoms you experienced and how long they lasted. This will help to rule out other conditions.\nEven if you no longer have symptoms, you might still need a neurological examination. This involves simple tasks designed to check your strength, sensation and co-ordination skills.\nIf a TIA is suspected you should be started on medication to reduce the risk of a further TIA or stroke. The risk of another is highest in the days after a TIA or stroke so it&#8217;s important to start this medication as soon as you are advised to.\nIf a TIA is suspected, you’ll see a specialist for further tests as soon as possible.\nIt&#8217;s important that you attend for this assessment as soon as it&#8217;s available. Seeing you urgently means you can receive appropriate treatment to prevent a further TIA or stroke.\nIt’s likely you’ll see a doctor who specialises in strokes.\nYou might have some tests to rule out other causes of your symptoms and to help identify the underlying cause of your TIA.\nYou might need&nbsp;blood tests to determine whether you have high cholesterol, and to check if you have diabetes.\nAn electrocardiogram (ECG) measures your heart&#8217;s electrical activity using electrodes (small, sticky patches) on your skin.\nAn ECG can detect abnormal heart rhythms, which may be a sign of conditions like atrial fibrillation (where your heart beats irregularly).\nA carotid ultrasound scan can show if there&#8217;s narrowing or blockages in the neck arteries leading to your brain.\nA small probe (transducer) sends high-frequency sound waves into your body. When these sound waves bounce back, they create an image of the inside of your body.\nBrain scans are not always necessary if you&#8217;ve had a TIA.\nYou might have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. This scan uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to create an image of your brain.\nYou might have a computerised tomography (CT) scan if an MRI scan is not suitable for you. This type of scan uses a series of X-rays to produce an image of the inside of brain.\nAlthough the symptoms of a TIA stop on their own, you’ll need treatment to help reduce the risk of another TIA or a full stroke.\nAppropriate treatment following a TIA can help to reduce your risk of having one.\nYour doctor will tell you about lifestyle changes you can make to reduce your stroke risk. Your doctor will prescribe medication to treat the underlying cause of your TIA. You might need surgery as part of your treatment.\nThere are lifestyle changes you can make that may help reduce your chances of having a stroke after a TIA like:\n- eating a healthy diet&nbsp;–&nbsp;a low-fat, low-salt, high-fibre diet is usually recommended, with plenty of fresh fruit, vegetables and whole grains\n- exercising regularly – this can help lower your cholesterol level and keep your blood pressure at a healthy level\n- stopping smoking&nbsp;if you smoke\n- cutting down on the amount of alcohol you drink\nMost people who’ve had a TIA will take medication to reduce their chances of having a stroke or another TIA.\nAfter a TIA, the aim is to reduce the risk of a stroke especially in the first few days. To do this a combination of treatments is usually recommended. Some of the treatments might include:\n- antiplatelets like aspirin and clopidogrel\n- anticoagulants like apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran or warfarin\n- medication to lower your blood pressure (antihypertensives)\n- statins to lower your cholesterol\nThe antiplatelet medications need to be taken immediately. Others may only be started later and usually need to be taken long term.\nA carotid endarterectomy is an operation to remove part of the lining of the carotid artery and any blockage in the artery.\nBy unblocking the carotid arteries, a carotid endarterectomy can reduce the risk of having a stroke or another TIA."

        "disease": "Transverse myelitis",
        "description": "Transverse myelitis is a rare neurological condition. It&#8217;s caused by inflammation (swelling) of the spinal cord. The swelling damages the nerves and can leave permanent scars or lesions.\nThe scars or lesions interrupt the communication between the nerves in the spinal cord and the rest of the body.\n&#8216;Transverse&#8217; refers to the swelling being across the width of the spinal cord. It&#8217;s also sometimes used to describe swelling that only affects part of the width of the spinal cord.\nThe symptoms of transverse myelitis can include:\n- muscle weakness in the legs, and sometimes the arms\n- mobility problems\n- unusual sensations and numbness\n- bladder problems\n- bowel problems\n- sexual problems\n- pain\nTransverse myelitis can happen to anyone at any time in their life. In most cases there might only be one episode of symptoms, but sometimes it can happen repeatedly. Transverse myelitis can be the first sign of MS or another condition.\nThere are several different causes of transverse myelitis. Sometimes a cause isn&#8217;t found, and this is called idiopathic transverse myelitis.\nSometimes transverse myelitis is caused by an autoimmune reaction. In autoimmune diseases, the immune system mistakes the body&#8217;s own tissue as dangerous and attacks it. This causes swelling that results in damage to the myelin sheath. This includes:\n- MS-like swelling\n- neuromyelitis optica (NMO)\n- myelin oligodendrocyte antibody (MOG) associated myelitis\n- sarcoidosis\n- Sjögrens syndrome\n- lupus\nSometimes transverse myelitis is caused indirectly by a viral infection, although often the virus responsible isn&#8217;t identified.\nTransverse myelitis often develops after a viral infection like:\n- echovirus\n- enterovirus\n- Epstien-Barr\n- hepatitis A\n- herpes simplex\n- HIV\n- rubella\n- influenza (flu)\n- varicella zoster (the virus that causes chicken pox and shingles)\nBacterial infections such as syphilis might also lead to transverse myelitis.\nSome cancers might trigger an unusual immune response that can lead to transverse myelitis.\nIf your GP thinks you could have transverse myelitis, you should see a neurologist (a specialist in conditions of the nervous system) for a specialist assessment.\nSome of the tests you may need to confirm transverse myelitis are:\n- neurological examination\n- magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan\n- lumbar puncture\n- blood tests\nSometimes your neurologist will do other tests to look for conditions that cause transverse myelitis. This might include CT scans.\nSometimes transverse myelitis requires no treatment as it will improve on its own. Sometimes patients may require treatment for their symptoms, the swelling, or the underlying cause.\nThere are different treatments available for transverse myelitis symptoms.\nPhysiotherapy can help improve strength, and the muscle spasms and stiffness that may sometimes develop.\nTechniques&nbsp;such as stretching exercises can help if your movement is restricted.\nIf your muscle spasms are more severe, you may be prescribed a medicine that can relax your muscles. This will usually be either baclofen, gabapentin or tizanidine.\nThese medicines all have side effects. You might experience dizziness, weakness, nausea and diarrhoea. Discuss which of these would be best for you with your&nbsp;healthcare professional.\nMobility problems are often the result of muscle spasms and spasticity. Muscle weakness, or problems with balance can also cause mobility problems.\nIf you have problems with mobility, your healthcare professional might suggest:\n- an exercise programme&nbsp;supervised by a physiotherapist\n- mobility aids, such as a walking stick, or a wheelchair\n- home adaptations such as stair lifts or railings\nAn&nbsp;occupational therapist&nbsp;can carry out an assessment of your home and suggest adaptations.\nSometimes your neurologist might offer treatment with steroids. This can help with some types of transverse myelitis. Steroids are only given for a short period of time to avoid possible steroid side effects. The side effects could include reflux and stomach irritation, worsening infection, mood swings, and difficulty sleeping.\nMedication might help if you have an overactive bladder or need to pee frequently during the night.\nIf you find it difficult to empty your bladder, advice from a continence nurse or physiotherapist can help. Hand-held external stimulators can help some people to start peeing or to empty the bladder.\nSometimes a catheter&nbsp;can empty the bladder when needed. You might be taught how to do intermittent self catheterisation (ISC).\nIn rare cases, people with transverse myelitis may need a long-term catheter to keep the bladder emptying safely.\nYou might be referred to a continence adviser or urologist, for specialist treatment and advice. Read more about treating urinary incontinence.\nIt might be possible to treat mild to moderate constipation by changing your diet or taking laxatives.\nMore severe constipation may need to be treated with suppositories, which are inserted into your bottom, or an enema. During an enema, liquid medication is rinsed through your bottom and large bowel, which softens and flushes out your stools.\nAnti diarrhoea medication or pelvic floor exercises might help bowel incontinence.\nIf you experience problems with less interest in sex or difficulty reaching orgasm, relationship counselling or seeing a sex therapist might help.\nIf you have transverse myelitis and find it hard to get or maintain an erection (erectile dysfunction) you may be prescribed&nbsp;medication to&nbsp;increase the blood flow to the penis.\nA physiotherapist might be able to help with&nbsp;this pain by suggesting exercises or better seating positions.\nIf your pain is more severe, you may be prescribed painkillers. Or, you might have a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) machine that stimulates your nerves.\nNeuropathic pain is caused by damage to your nerves and is usually sharp and stabbing. It can also occur in the form of extreme skin sensitivity, or a burning sensation.\nThis type of pain can be treated using neuropathic painkillers.\nYou may be offered other treatments depending on the cause of your transverse myelitis. Your neurologist will discuss your options with you."

There are 2 main ways the sample can be collected:\n- using a swab – a small cotton bud is gently wiped over the area that might be infected, such as inside the vagina or penis\n- urine sample – this should ideally be done at least 1 or 2 hours after you last peed\nMost sexual health clinics can look at the sample straightaway under the microscope and see the parasite. In some clinics and at your GP, the swab needs to be sent away to a lab to make the diagnosis.\nThe test is more accurate from vagina samples. It&#8217;s less accurate from penis and urine samples.\nTrichomonas infection is treated with antibiotics.\nIt&#8217;s advised that both you and your partner(s) are treated if you have the infection.\nYou and your partner(s) may be asked to return to your GP practice or sexual health clinic for another test to check the infection has gone.\nYou should avoid having sex until 1 week after you and your partner(s) treatment has finished.\nIf your infection is untreated you may pass it on to other sexual partners.\nTrichomonas infection is spread through unprotected sex and sharing sex toys.\nIt&#8217;s not passed on through oral or anal sex.\nYou can&#8217;t pass on trichomonas through:\n- kissing or hugging\n- sharing cups, plates or cutlery\n- toilet seats\nThe best way to reduce your risk of STIs is to practice safer sex. This means using a condom for vaginal, anal and oral sex.\nIf you have been diagnosed with trichomonas, you should get tested for all STIs including:\n- chlamydia\n- gonorrhoea\n- syphilis"

        "disease": "Trigeminal neuralgia",
        "description": "Trigeminal neuralgia is a sudden, severe facial pain, described as sharp, shooting or like an electric shock.\nIt usually occurs in sudden short attacks lasting from a few seconds to about two minutes, which stop just as abruptly.\nIn the vast majority of cases it affects part or all of one side of the face,&nbsp;with the pain most commonly felt in the lower part of the face. Very occasionally it affects both sides of the face, but not normally at the same time.\nPeople with the condition may experience attacks of pain regularly for days, weeks or months at a time. In severe cases, attacks may occur hundreds of times a day.\nIt&#8217;s possible for the pain to improve or even disappear altogether for several months or years at a time (known as a period of remission), although these periods of remission tend to get shorter with time. Some people may then go on to develop a more continuous aching, throbbing and burning sensation, sometimes accompanied by the sharp attacks.\nTypically, the attacks of pain are brought on by activities that involve lightly touching the face, such as washing, eating and brushing the teeth, but they can also be triggered by wind (even a slight breeze or air conditioning) or movement of the face or head. Sometimes, the pain can occur without any trigger whatsoever.\nLiving with trigeminal neuralgia can be very difficult and it can have a significant impact on a person&#8217;s quality of life, resulting in problems such as weight loss, isolation and depression.\nRead more about the symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia\nYou should see your GP if you experience frequent or persistent facial pain, particularly if standard painkillers such as&nbsp;paracetamol and ibuprofen do not help and a dentist has ruled out any dental causes.\nYour GP will try to identify the problem by asking about your symptoms and ruling out conditions that could be responsible for your pain.\nHowever, diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia can be difficult, and it can take a few years for a diagnosis to be confirmed.\nRead more about diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia\nIn the vast majority of cases, trigeminal neuralgia is caused by compression of the trigeminal nerve. This is the largest nerve inside the skull, which transmits sensations of pain and touch from your face, teeth and mouth to your brain.\nThis compression is usually caused by a nearby blood vessel pressing on part of the nerve inside the skull.\nIn rare cases, trigeminal neuralgia can occur as a result of damage to the trigeminal nerve, caused by an underlying condition such as&nbsp;multiple sclerosis (MS) or a tumour.\nRead more about the causes of trigeminal neuralgia\nIt&#8217;s not clear exactly how many people are affected by trigeminal neuralgia, but the condition is thought to be rare.\nSome studies have suggested that around 27 in every 100,000 people are diagnosed with the condition in the UK each year, although this figure is probably too high as the condition tends to be over-diagnosed by doctors. Other estimates have suggested that there are about 6,500 new cases diagnosed each year in the UK.\nThe condition affects women more often than men and is rare in people under the age of 40, although it can occur in younger people. Most cases are first seen in people between the ages of 50 and 60.\nTrigeminal neuralgia is usually a long-term condition, and the periods of remission often get shorter over time. However, most cases can be controlled to at least some degree with treatment.\nThe first treatment offered will usually be with an anticonvulsant medication (usually used to treat&nbsp;epilepsy) called carbamazepine. To be effective, this medication needs to be taken several times a day, with the dose gradually increased over the course of a few days or weeks so that high enough levels of the medication can build up in your bloodstream.\nUnless your pain starts to diminish or disappears altogether, the medication is usually continued for as long as is necessary, sometimes for many years. If you are entering a period of remission and your pain goes away, stopping the medication should always be done slowly over days or weeks, unless you are advised otherwise by a doctor.\nCarbamazepine was not originally designed to treat pain, but it can help relieve nerve pain by slowing down electrical impulses in the nerves and reducing their ability to transmit pain messages.\nIf this medication is ineffective, unsuitable or causes too many side effects, you may be referred to a specialist to discuss alternative medications or surgical procedures that may help.\nThere are a number of minor surgical procedures that can be used to treat trigeminal neuralgia – usually by damaging the nerve to stop it sending pain signals – but these are generally only effective for a few years.\nAlternatively, your specialist may recommend having surgery to open up your skull and move away any blood vessels compressing the trigeminal nerve. Research suggests this operation offers the best results in terms of long-term pain relief, but it is a major operation and carries a risk of potentially serious complications, such as&nbsp;hearing loss,&nbsp;facial numbness or, very rarely, a stroke.\nRead more about treating trigeminal neuralgia\nThe main symptom of trigeminal neuralgia is sudden attacks of severe, sharp and shooting facial pain that last from a few seconds to about two minutes.\nThe pain is often described as an excruciating sensation, similar to an electric shock. The attacks can be so severe that you are unable to do anything during them, and the pain can sometimes bring you to your knees.\nTrigeminal neuralgia usually only affects one side of your face. In rare cases it can affect both sides, although not at the same time. The pain can be in the teeth, the lower jaw, upper jaw, cheek and, less commonly, in the forehead or the eye.\nYou may feel aware of an impending attack of pain, though these usually come unexpectedly.\nAfter the main, severe pain has subsided, you may experience a slight ache or burning feeling. There may also be a constant throbbing, aching or burning sensation between attacks.\nYou may have episodes of pain lasting regularly for days, weeks or months at a time. It is possible for the pain to then disappear completely and not recur for several months or years (a period known as &#8220;remission&#8221;). However, in severe cases, attacks may occur hundreds of times a day, and there may be no periods of remission.\nAttacks of trigeminal neuralgia can be triggered by certain actions or movements, such as:\n- talking\n- smiling\n- chewing\n- brushing your teeth\n- washing your face\n- a light touch\n- shaving or putting on make-up\n- swallowing\n- kissing\n- a cool breeze or air conditioning\n- head movements\n- vibrations, such as walking or a car journey\nHowever, pain can occur spontaneously with no triggers whatsoever.\nLiving with trigeminal neuralgia can be extremely difficult, and your quality of life can be significantly affected.\nYou may feel like avoiding activities such as washing, shaving or eating to avoid triggering pain, and the fear of pain may mean you avoid social activities. However, it&#8217;s important to try to live a normal life, and be aware that becoming undernourished or dehydrated can make the pain far worse.\nThe emotional strain of living with repeated episodes of pain can lead to psychological problems, such as depression. During periods of extreme pain, some people may even consider suicide. Even when pain-free, you may live in fear of the pain returning.\nYou should see your GP if you experience frequent or persistent facial pain, particularly if standard painkillers such as paracetamol&nbsp;and ibuprofen&nbsp;do not help and a dentist has ruled out any dental causes.\nYour GP will try to identify the problem by asking about your symptoms and ruling out conditions that could be responsible for your pain. Trigeminal neuralgia can be a difficult condition to diagnose, so it’s important to try to describe your symptoms as accurately and in as much detail as possible.\nRead more about diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia\nAlthough the exact cause is not known, trigeminal neuralgia is often thought to be caused by compression of the trigeminal nerve or an underlying condition affecting this nerve.\nThe trigeminal nerve (also called the fifth cranial nerve) is the largest nerve inside the skull. You have two trigeminal nerves, one in each side of your face. Small branches from different parts of the face join into three major nerve branches. These are:\n- the upper branch (ophthalmic) – which carries sensory information from the skin above the eye, forehead and front of the head\n- the middle branch (maxillary) – which carries sensory information from the skin through the cheek, side of the nose, upper jaw, teeth and gums\n- the lower branch (mandibular) – which carries sensory information from the skin through the lower jaw, teeth and gums\nThese branches enter the skull through three different routes and then join together in what is called the Gasserian ganglion, before connecting to the brainstem in the part of the skull called the posterior fossa.&nbsp;\nTrigeminal neuralgia can involve one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve. The maxillary and mandibular branches are affected most often, and the ophthalmic branch is the least commonly affected.\nEvidence suggests that in up to 95% of cases, the cause of trigeminal neuralgia is pressure on the trigeminal nerve close to where it enters the brain stem (the lowest part of the brain that merges with the spinal cord), past the Gasserian ganglion.\nIn most cases, this pressure seems to be caused by an artery or vein compressing the trigeminal nerve, although it&#8217;s not known why this happens.\nIt&#8217;s also not clear exactly why this pressure can cause painful attacks, as not everyone with a compressed trigeminal nerve will experience pain. It may be that, in some people, the pressure on the nerve wears away its protective outer layer called the myelin sheath, which may cause uncontrollable pain signals to travel along the nerve.&nbsp;\nHowever, this does not fully explain why periods of remission (periods without symptoms) can occur and why pain relief is immediate after a successful operation to move the blood vessels away from the nerve.\nOther reasons why the trigeminal nerve can become compressed or damaged include:\n- a tumour (a growth or lump)\n- a cyst (fluid-filled sac)\n- arteriovenous malformation (an abnormal tangle of arteries and veins)\n- multiple sclerosis (MS) – a long-term condition that affects the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord)\nAs the pain caused by trigeminal neuralgia is often felt in the jaw, teeth or gums, it is common for people to visit their dentist initially, rather than their GP.\nIf you visit your dentist, they will ask you questions about your symptoms and investigate your facial pain using a dental X-ray and other means to look for other more common causes, such as a dental infection or cracked tooth.&nbsp;\nIf the dentist cannot find a cause, it is important not to undergo unnecessary treatment such as a root canal filling or an extraction, even though you may be convinced that it is a tooth problem. If your dentist can&#8217;t find anything wrong, do not try to persuade them to remove a particular tooth, as this will not solve the problem.\nOften, the diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia is made by a dentist, but if you have already seen your dentist and they have not been able to find an obvious cause of your pain, visit your GP.\nThere is no specific test for trigeminal neuralgia, so a diagnosis is largely based on your symptoms and your description of the pain.\nIf you have experienced facial pain, your GP will ask you questions about your symptoms, such as how often they occur, how long the pain attacks last and which areas of your face are affected. The more details about your pain you can provide, the better.\nYour GP will consider other possible causes of your pain and may also examine your head and jaw to identify which parts are painful.\nAn important part of the process of diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia involves ruling out other conditions that can also cause facial pain.\nBy asking about your symptoms and carrying out an examination, your GP may be able to rule out other conditions, such as:\n- migraine\n- joint pain in the lower jaw\n- giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis) – a condition in which medium and large arteries in the head and neck become inflamed and cause pain in the jaw and temples\n- a possible injury to one of the facial nerves\nYour medical, personal and family history will also need to be taken into consideration when determining possible causes of your pain.\nFor example, trigeminal neuralgia is less likely if you are under 40 years old, and&nbsp;multiple sclerosis (MS)&nbsp;may be more likely if you have a family history of the condition or if you have some other form of this condition. However, trigeminal neuralgia is very unlikely to be the first symptom of MS. &nbsp;\nIf your GP is not sure about your diagnosis, or if you have unusual symptoms, they may refer you for a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan&nbsp;of your head.\nAn MRI scan uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the inside of your head. It can help identify potential causes of your facial pain, such as&nbsp;sinusitis (inflammation of the lining of the sinuses), tumours on one of the facial nerves, or nerve damage caused by MS.\nAn MRI can also sometimes detect whether a blood vessel in your head is compressing one of the trigeminal nerves, which is one of the main causes of trigeminal neuralgia. However, highly sophisticated MRI scans may be needed to show this accurately, although this may not necessarily be helpful, because not everyone with a compressed trigeminal nerve has trigeminal neuralgia.\nThere are a number of treatments available that can offer some relief from the pain caused by trigeminal neuralgia.\nIdentifying triggers and avoiding them can also help.\nMost people with trigeminal neuralgia will be prescribed medication to help control their pain, although surgery may be considered for the longer term in those cases where medication is ineffective or causes too many side effects.\nThe painful attacks associated with trigeminal neuralgia can sometimes be triggered or made worse by a number of different things. Therefore, in addition to your medical treatment, it may help to try to avoid these triggers, if possible.\nFor example, if your pain is triggered by wind or even a draught in a room, it may help to avoid sitting near open windows or the source of air conditioning, and wearing a scarf wrapped around your face in windy weather. A transparent dome-shaped umbrella can also protect your face from the weather.\nHot, spicy or cold food or drink may also trigger your pain, so avoiding these can help. Using a straw to drink warm or cold drinks may also help prevent the liquid coming into contact with the painful areas of your mouth. It is important to eat nourishing meals, however, so if you are having difficulty chewing, consider eating mushy foods or liquidising your meals.&nbsp;\nCertain foods seem to trigger attacks in some people, so you may want to consider avoiding things such as caffeine, citrus fruits and bananas.\nAs normal painkillers such as&nbsp;paracetamol are not effective in treating trigeminal neuralgia, you will normally be prescribed an alternative medication, such as an anticonvulsant medication (usually used to treat&nbsp;epilepsy) to help control your pain.\nThese medications were not originally designed to treat pain, but they can help relieve nerve pain by slowing down electrical impulses in the nerves and reducing their ability to transmit pain.&nbsp;\nThey need to be taken regularly, not just when the pain attacks occur, but can be stopped when the episodes of pain cease and you are in remission.&nbsp; Unless otherwise instructed by your GP or specialist, it is important to build up the dosage slowly and reduce it again gradually over a few weeks. Taking too much too soon and stopping the medication too quickly can cause serious problems.\nInitially, your GP will probably prescribe a type of anticonvulsant called carbamazepine, although a number of alternatives are available if this is ineffective or unsuitable.\nThe anticonvulsant&nbsp;carbamazepine is currently the only medication licensed for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia in the UK. It can be very effective initially, but may become less effective over time.\nYou will usually need to take this medicine at a low dose once or twice a day, with the dose slowly increasing up to four times a day until it provides satisfactory pain relief.\nCarbamazepine often causes side effects, which may make it difficult for some people to take. These include:\n- tiredness and sleepiness\n- dizziness (lightheadedness)\n- difficulty concentrating and memory problems\n- confusion\n- feeling unsteady on your feet\n- feeling sick and vomiting\n- double vision\n- a reduced number of infection-fighting white blood cells (leukopenia)\n- allergic skin reactions, such as&nbsp;urticaria (hives)\nYou should speak to your GP if you experience any persistent or troublesome side effects while you are taking carbamazepine, especially allergic skin reactions, as these could be dangerous.\nCarbamazepine has also been linked to a number of less common but more serious side effects, including thoughts of&nbsp;self-harm or suicide. You should immediately report any suicidal feelings to your GP. If this is not possible, call the NHS 24 111 service.&nbsp;\nCarbamazepine may stop working over time. If this occurs, or if you experience significant side effects while taking it, you should be referred to a specialist to consider alternative medications or procedures.\nThere are a number of specialists you may be referred to for further treatment, including neurologists specialising in headaches, neurosurgeons and pain medicine specialists (for example, at a pain clinic).\nIn addition to carbamazepine, there are a number of other medications that have been used to treat trigeminal neuralgia, including:\n- oxcarbazepine\n- lamotrigine\n- gabapentin\n- pregabalin\n- baclofen&nbsp;\nNone of these medications are specifically licensed for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, which means they have not undergone rigorous&nbsp;clinical trials to determine whether they are effective and safe to treat the condition.\nHowever, this is largely only because trigeminal neuralgia is a rare condition, and clinical trials are difficult to carry out on such a painful condition because giving some people an inactive, &#8220;dummy&#8221; medication (placebo) to compare these medications to would be unethical and impractical.\nHowever, many specialists will prescribe an unlicensed medication if they think it is likely to be effective and the benefits of treatment outweigh any associated risks.\nIf your specialist is considering prescribing an unlicensed medication to treat trigeminal neuralgia, they should inform you that it is unlicensed and discuss possible risks and benefits with you.\nWith most of these medications, the side effects can be quite difficult to cope with initially. Not everyone experiences side effects, but if you do, try to persevere because they do tend to diminish with time or at least until the next dosage increase, when you may find a further period of adjustment is necessary. Talk to your GP if you are finding the side effects unbearable.\nIf medication does not adequately control your symptoms or is causing persistently troublesome side effects, you may be referred to a specialist to discuss the different surgical and non-surgical options available to relieve your pain.\nThere a number of procedures that have been used to treat trigeminal neuralgia, so you will need to discuss the potential benefits and risks of each treatment with your specialist before making a decision. It is wise to be as informed as possible and to make the choice that it right for you as an individual.\nThere is no guarantee that one or any of these procedures will work for you but, once you have had a successful procedure, you won’t need to take your pain medications unless the pain returns. If one procedure does not work, you can always try another or remain on your medication temporarily or permanently.\nSome of the procedures that can be used to treat people with trigeminal neuralgia are outlined below.\nThere are a number of procedures that can offer some relief from trigeminal neuralgia pain, at least temporarily, by inserting a needle or thin tube through the cheek and into the trigeminal nerve inside the skull.\nThese are known can &#8220;percutaneous&#8221; (through the skin) procedures, and they are carried out using&nbsp;X-rays to guide the needle or tube into the correct place while you are heavily sedated with medication or under a&nbsp;general anaesthetic (where you are asleep).\nPercutaneous procedures that can be carried out to treat people with trigeminal neuralgia include:\n- glycerol injections – where a medication called glycerol in injected around the Gasserian ganglion (where the three main branches of the trigeminal nerve join together)&nbsp;\n- radiofrequency lesioning – where a needle is used to apply heat directly to the the Gasserian ganglion&nbsp;\n- balloon compression – where a tiny balloon is passed along a thin tube inserted through the cheek and is inflated around the Gasserian ganglion to squeeze it; the balloon is then removed\nThese procedures work by deliberately injuring or damaging the trigeminal nerve, which is thought to disrupt the pain signals travelling along it. You are usually able to go home the same day, following your treatment.\nOverall, all of these procedures are similarly effective in relieving trigeminal neuralgia pain, although there can be complications with each, and these vary with the procedure and the individual. The pain relief will usually only last a few years, and sometimes only a few months. Sometimes these procedures do not work at all.\nThe major side effect of these procedures is numbness of part or all the side of the face, and this can vary in severity from being very numb or just pins and needles. The sensation, which can be permanent, is often similar to that following an injection at the dentist. Very rarely, you can get a combination of numbness and continuous pain called anesthesia dolorosa, which is virtually untreatable.\nThe procedures also carry a risk of other short- and long-term side effects and complications, including bleeding, facial bruising, eye problems and problems moving the facial muscles.\nAn alternative way to relieve pain by damaging the trigeminal nerve that doesn&#8217;t involve inserting anything through the skin is stereotactic radiosurgery. This is a fairly new treatment that uses a concentrated beam of radiation to deliberately damage the trigeminal nerve where it enters the brainstem.\nStereotactic radiosurgery does not require a&nbsp;general anaesthetic and no cuts (incisions) are made in your cheek.\nA metal frame is attached to your head with four pins inserted around your scalp (a&nbsp;local anaesthetic is used to numb the areas where these are inserted) and your head, complete with the frame attached, is held in a large machine for an hour or two (which may make you feel claustrophobic) while the radiation is given. The frame and pins are then removed, and you are able to go home after a short rest.\nIt can take a few weeks – or sometimes many months – for this procedure to take effect, but it can offer pain relief for some people for several months or years. Studies into this treatment have shown similar results to the other procedures mentioned above.\nThe most common complications associated with stereotactic radiosurgery include facial numbness and&nbsp;pins and needles (paraesthesia) in the face. This can be permanent and, in some cases, very troublesome.\nMicrovascular decompression (MVD) is an operation that can help relieve trigeminal neuralgia pain without intentionally damaging the trigeminal nerve. Instead, the procedure involves relieving the pressure placed on the nerve by blood vessels that are touching the nerve or wrapped around it.\nThis is a major procedure that involves opening up the skull, and is carried out under general anaesthetic by a neurosurgeon.\nDuring MVD, the surgeon will make an incision in your scalp, behind your ear, and remove a small circular piece of skull bone. They will then either remove or relocate the blood vessel(s), separating them from the trigeminal nerve using an artificial pad or a sling constructed from adjoining tissue.\nFor many people, this type of surgery is effective in easing or completely stopping the pain of trigeminal neuralgia. It provides the longest lasting relief, with some studies suggesting that pain only recurs in about 30% of cases within 10-20 years of surgery.&nbsp; Currently, this is the closest possible cure for trigeminal neuralgia.\nHowever, it&#8217;s an invasive procedure and carries a risk of potentially serious complications, such as facial numbness, hearing loss, stroke and even death (in around 1 in every 200 cases).\nLiving with a long-term and painful condition such as trigeminal neuralgia can be very difficult.\nYou may find it useful to contact local or national support groups, such as the Trigeminal Neuralgia Association UK, for more information and advice about living with the condition, and to get in touch with other people who have the condition to talk to them about their experiences.\nResearch has shown that groups that have support from health care professionals provide high-quality help, which can significantly improve your ability to manage this rare condition. Learning from others how to cope can help remove the fear of more pain and reduce the risk of depression.\nHowever, you need to be wary of potentially unreliable information you may find elsewhere, especially if offering “cures” for the condition. There is a great deal of misinformation on the internet, so do your research only on reliable websites, not on open forums or on social media.\nThere are a number of research projects running both in the UK and abroad to determine the cause of this condition and to find new treatments, including new medications, so there is always hope on the horizon."

        "description": "\r\n                    Audio                 \r\n                                    &nbsp;|&nbsp;\r\n                                            \r\n                    British Sign Language (BSL)                \nTuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infection spread through inhaling tiny droplets from the coughs or sneezes of an infected person.\nIt is a serious&nbsp;condition, but can be cured with proper treatment.\nTB mainly affects the lungs. However, it can affect any part of the body, including the glands, bones and nervous system.\nTypical symptoms of TB include:\n- a persistent cough that lasts more than three weeks and usually brings up phlegm, which may be bloody\n- weight loss\n- night sweats\n- high temperature (fever)\n- tiredness and fatigue\n- loss of appetite\n- new swellings that haven&#8217;t gone away after a few weeks\nYou should see a GP if you have a cough that lasts&nbsp;more than three weeks or if you cough up blood.\nRead more about the&nbsp;symptoms of TB&nbsp;and&nbsp;diagnosing TB\nTB is caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis.\nTB that affects the lungs is the most contagious type, but it&nbsp;usually only spreads after&nbsp;prolonged exposure to someone with the illness. For example,&nbsp;it often spreads within a family who live in the same house.\nIn most healthy people, the immune system (the body&#8217;s natural defence against infection and illness) kills the bacteria, and you have no symptoms.\nSometimes the immune system cannot kill the bacteria, but manages to prevent it spreading in the body. This means you will not have any symptoms, but the bacteria will remain in your body. This is known as &#8216;latent TB&#8217;.\nIf the immune system fails to kill or contain the infection, it can spread within the lungs or other parts of the body and symptoms will develop within a few weeks or months. This is known as &#8216;active TB&#8217;.\nLatent TB could develop into an active TB infection at a later date, particularly if your immune system becomes weakened.\nRead more about the causes of TB\nBefore antibiotics were introduced, TB was a major health problem in the UK. Nowadays, the condition is much less common.\nHowever, in the last 20 years, TB cases have gradually increased, particularly among ethnic minority communities who are originally from countries where TB is more common.\nIt&#8217;s estimated that around one-third of the world&#8217;s population is infected with latent TB. Of these, up to 10% will become active at some point.\nWith treatment, TB can usually be cured. Most people will need a course of antibiotics, usually for 6 months.\nSeveral different antibiotics are used. This is because some forms of TB are resistant to certain antibiotics. If you are infected with a drug-resistant form of TB, treatment with 6 or more different medications may be needed.\nIf you are in close contact with someone who has TB, tests may be carried out to see if you are also infected. These can include a chest X-ray,&nbsp;blood tests, and a skin test called the Mantoux test.\nRead more about&nbsp;treating TB\nThe&nbsp;BCG&nbsp;vaccine&nbsp;can&nbsp;provide effective protection against TB in up to&nbsp;8 out of 10&nbsp;people&nbsp;who are given it.\nCurrently, BCG vaccinations are only recommended for groups of people who are at a higher risk of developing TB.\nThis includes children living in areas with high rates of TB, or those who have close family members from countries with high TB rates, and&nbsp;people under the age of 16&nbsp;who are going to live and work with local people in an area with high rates of TB&nbsp;for more than three months.\nIt&#8217;s also recommended that some people, such as healthcare workers, are vaccinated&nbsp;because of&nbsp;the increased risk of contracting TB while working.\nThe symptoms of tuberculosis (TB) depend on where the infection occurs.\nTB usually develops slowly. Your symptoms might not begin until months or even years after you were initially infected.\nIn some cases the infection doesn&#8217;t cause any symptoms, which is known as latent TB. It&#8217;s called active TB if you have symptoms.&nbsp;You should contact your GP if you or your child have symptoms of TB.\nRead about the causes of tuberculosis for more information about latent and active TB.\nGeneral symptoms of TB include:\n- lack of appetite and weight loss\n- a high temperature (fever)\n- night sweats\n- extreme tiredness or fatigue\nThese symptoms can have many different causes, however, and are not always a sign of TB.\nTB can also cause additional symptoms depending on which part of the body is infected.\nMost infections affect the lungs, which can cause:\n- a persistent cough that lasts more than 3 weeks and usually brings up phlegm, which may be bloody\n- breathlessness&nbsp;that gradually gets worse\nThis is known as pulmonary TB.\nLess commonly, TB infections develop in areas outside the lungs, such as the lymph nodes (small glands that form part of the immune system), the bones and joints, the digestive system, the bladder and reproductive system, and the&nbsp;nervous system (brain and nerves).\nThis is known as extrapulmonary TB.\nSymptoms of extrapulmonary TB vary, but can include:\n- persistently&nbsp;swollen glands\n- abdominal (tummy) pain\n- pain and loss of movement in an affected bone or joint\n- confusion\n- a persistent&nbsp;headache\n- seizures (fits)\nExtrapulmonary TB is more common in people with a weakened immune system, such as those with HIV.\nTuberculosis (TB) is caused by a type of bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis.\nThe condition is spread when a person with an active TB infection in their lungs coughs or sneezes and someone else inhales the expelled droplets, which&nbsp;contain TB bacteria.\nAlthough it is spread in a similar way to a&nbsp;cold or the&nbsp;flu, TB is not as contagious. You would usually have to spend prolonged periods in close contact with an infected person to catch the infection yourself.\nFor example, TB infections usually spread between family members who live in the same house. It would be highly unlikely to become infected by sitting next to an infected person on a bus or train.\nNot everyone with TB is infectious. Generally, children with TB or people with TB that occurs outside the lungs (extrapulmonary TB) do not spread the infection.\nIn most healthy people the immune system is able to destroy the bacteria that cause TB. However, in some cases the bacteria infect the body but don&#8217;t cause any symptoms (latent TB), or the infection begins to cause symptoms within weeks or months (active TB).\nUp to 10% of people with latent TB eventually develop active TB years after the initial infection. This usually happens when the immune system is weakened&nbsp;–&nbsp;for example, during chemotherapy.\nAnyone can catch TB, but people particularly at risk include those:\n- who live in, come from, or have spent time in a country or area with high levels of TB – around 3 in every 4 TB cases in the UK affect people born outside the UK\n- in prolonged close contact with someone who is infected\n- living in crowded conditions\n- with a condition that weakens their immune system, such as HIV\n- having treatments that weaken the immune system, such as corticosteroids, chemotherapy or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors (used to treat some types of arthritis&nbsp;and certain gut conditions)\n- who are very young or very old – the immune systems of people who are young or elderly tend to be weaker than those of healthy adults\n- in poor health or with a poor diet because of lifestyle and other problems, such as drug misuse, alcohol misuse, or homelessness\nSeveral tests are used to diagnose tuberculosis (TB), depending on the type of TB suspected.\nYour GP may refer you to a TB specialist for testing and treatment if they think you have TB.\nA diagnosis of pulmonary TB (TB that affects the lungs) can be difficult and several tests are usually needed.\nThis will include a chest&nbsp;X-ray to look for changes in the appearance of your lungs that are suggestive of TB. Samples of phlegm will also often be taken and checked for the presence of TB bacteria.\nThese tests are important in helping to&nbsp;decide on&nbsp;the most effective treatment for you.\nIf you have suspected extrapulmonary TB (TB that occurs outside the lungs), several tests can be used to confirm a diagnosis. These may include:\n- a computerised tomography (CT) scan,&nbsp;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, or&nbsp;ultrasound scan&nbsp;of the affected part of the body\n- examining the inside of your body with a&nbsp;long, thin, flexible tube that contains a light and camera, which is inserted either through an opening such as your mouth (endoscopy) or a small cut made in your skin (laparoscopy)\n- urine and blood tests\n- a biopsy – a small sample of tissue or fluid is taken from the affected area and tested for TB bacteria\nYou may also have a lumbar puncture. This involves taking a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the base of your spine. CSF is&nbsp;fluid that surrounds the brain. It can be checked to see whether TB has infected your central nervous system (brain and spinal cord).\nIn some circumstances, you may need to be tested to check for latent TB (when you have been infected with TB bacteria, but do not have any symptoms).\nFor example, you may need to be screened if you have been in close contact with someone known to have an active TB infection (an infection that causes symptoms), or if you have recently spent time in a country where TB levels are high.\nIf you have just moved to the UK from a country where TB is common, you may be screened when you arrive or your GP may suggest screening when you register as a patient.\nThe Mantoux test is a widely used test for latent TB. It involves injecting a substance called PPD tuberculin into the skin of your forearm. It&#8217;s also called the tuberculin skin test (TST).\nIf you have a latent TB infection, your skin will be sensitive to PPD tuberculin and a hard red bump will develop at the site of the injection, usually within 48 to 72 hours of having the test. If you have a very strong skin reaction, you may need a chest X-ray to confirm whether you have an active TB infection.\nIf you do not have a latent infection, your skin will not react to the Mantoux test. However, as TB can take a long time to develop, you may need to be screened again at a later stage.\nIf you have had the BCG vaccination, you may have a mild skin reaction to the Mantoux test. This does not necessarily mean you have latent TB.\nThe IGRA is a newer type of blood test for TB that is becoming more widely available.\nThe IGRA may be used to help diagnose latent TB:\n- if you have a positive Mantoux test\n- if you previously had the BCG vaccination (as the Mantoux test may not be reliable in these cases)\n- as part of your TB screening if you have just moved to the UK from a country where TB is common\n- as part of a health check when you register with a GP\n- if you are about to have treatment that will suppress your immune system\n- if you are a healthcare worker\nTreatment for tuberculosis (TB) will usually involve a long course of antibiotics lasting several months.\nWhile TB is a serious condition that can be fatal if left untreated, deaths are rare if treatment is completed.\nFor most people, a hospital admission during treatment is not necessary.\nIf you’re diagnosed with active pulmonary TB (TB that affects your lungs and causes symptoms), you will be given a 6-month course of a combination of antibiotics. The usual course of treatment is:\n- 2 antibiotics (isoniazid and rifampicin) for 6 months\n- 2 additional antibiotics (pyrazinamide and ethambutol) for the first 2 months\nIt may be several weeks or months before you start to feel better. The exact length of time will depend on your overall health and the severity of your TB.\nAfter taking the medicine for 2 weeks, most people are no longer infectious and feel better. However, it is important to continue taking your medicine exactly as prescribed and to complete the whole course of antibiotics.\nTaking medication for 6 months is the most effective method of ensuring the TB bacteria are killed. If you stop taking your antibiotics before you complete the course, or you skip a dose, the TB infection may become resistant to the antibiotics. This is potentially serious, as it can be difficult to treat and will require a longer course of treatment.\nIf you find it difficult to take your medication every day, your treatment team can work with you to find a solution. This may include having regular contact with your treatment team at home, the treatment clinic, or somewhere else that is more convenient.\nIf&nbsp;treatment is completed correctly, you should not need any further checks by a TB specialist afterwards. However, you may be given advice about spotting signs that the illness has returned, although this is rare.\nIn&nbsp;rare cases TB can be fatal, even with treatment. Death can occur if the lungs become too damaged to work properly.\nExtrapulmonary TB (TB that occurs outside the lungs) can be treated using the same combination of antibiotics as those used to treat pulmonary TB. However, you may need to take them for 12 months.\nIf you have TB in areas such as your brain or the sac surrounding your heart (pericardium), you may initially be prescribed a&nbsp;corticosteroid such as prednisolone for several weeks to take at the same time as your antibiotics. This will help to reduce any swelling in the affected areas.\nAs with pulmonary TB, it&#8217;s important to take your medicines exactly as prescribed and to finish the whole course.\nLatent TB is when you have been infected with the TB bacteria, but do not have any symptoms of active disease. Treatment for latent TB is usually recommended for anyone aged 65 or under.\nHowever, the antibiotics used to treat TB can cause liver damage in older adults, so treatment for people with latent TB aged 35 to 65 isn’t recommended if this is a concern.\nLatent TB is also not always treated if it&#8217;s thought to be drug-resistant. If this is the case, you may be regularly monitored to check the infection does not become active.\nIn some cases, testing and treatment for latent TB may be recommended for people who require treatment that will weaken their immune system, such as long-term corticosteroids, chemotherapy or TNF inhibitors. This is because there is a risk of the infection becoming active.\nTreatment for latent TB generally involves either taking a combination of rifampicin and isoniazid for 3 months, or isoniazid on its own for 6 months.\nIsoniazid can cause nerve damage (peripheral neuropathy), but you’ll be given supplements of&nbsp;vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) to take alongside it to reduce this risk. Your liver function may be tested before you start treatment.\nIn rare cases, the antibiotics used to treat TB can cause eye damage, which can be serious. If you are going to be treated with ethambutol, your vision should also be tested at the beginning of the course of treatment.\nContact your TB treatment team if you develop any worrying symptoms during treatment, such as:\n- being sick&nbsp;\n- yellowing of your skin and whites of your eyes (jaundice)\n- an unexplained high temperature (fever)\n- tingling or numbness in your hands or feet\n- a rash or itchy skin\n- changes to your vision, such as blurred vision\nRifampicin can reduce the effectiveness of&nbsp;some types of contraception, such as the combined&nbsp;contraceptive pill. Use an alternative method of contraception, such as condoms, while taking rifampicin.\nIf you are diagnosed with pulmonary TB, you will be contagious up to about 2 to 3 weeks into your course of treatment.\nYou will not normally need to be isolated during this time, but it&#8217;s important to take some basic precautions to stop TB spreading to your family and friends. You should:\n- stay away from work, school or college until your TB treatment team advises you it is safe to return&nbsp;\n- always cover your mouth&nbsp;–&nbsp;preferably with a disposable tissue&nbsp;– when coughing, sneezing or laughing\n- carefully dispose of any used tissues in a sealed plastic bag&nbsp;\n- open windows when possible to ensure a good supply of fresh air in the areas where you spend time\n- do not sleep in the same room as other people, as you could cough or sneeze in your sleep without realising it"

        "disease": "Type 1 diabetes",
        "description": "Diabetes is a lifelong condition that causes a person&#8217;s blood glucose (sugar) level to become too high.\nThe hormone insulin – produced by the pancreas – is responsible for controlling the amount of glucose in the blood.\nThere are two main types of diabetes:\n- Type 1 – where the pancreas doesn&#8217;t produce any insulin\n- Type 2 – where the pancreas doesn&#8217;t produce enough insulin or the body’s cells don&#8217;t react to insulin\nThis topic is about type 1 diabetes.\nRead more about type 2 diabetes\nAnother type of diabetes, known as gestational diabetes, occurs in some pregnant women and tends to disappear following birth.\nIt&#8217;s very important for diabetes to be diagnosed as soon as possible, because it will get progressively worse if left untreated.\nYou should therefore visit your GP if you have symptoms, which include feeling thirsty, passing urine more often than usual and losing weight unexpectedly (see the list below for more diabetes symptoms).\nType 1 diabetes can develop at any age, but usually appears before the age of 40, particularly in childhood. Around 10% of all diabetes is type 1.\nIn type 1 diabetes, the pancreas (a small gland behind the stomach) progressively reduces the amount of insulin (the hormone that regulates blood glucose levels) it produces until it stops producing any at all.\nIf the amount of glucose in the blood is too high, it can, over time, seriously damage the body&#8217;s organs.\nThe symptoms of diabetes occur because the lack of insulin means that glucose is high but isn’t used by your muscles as fuel for energy.\nWhen blood glucose is high, glucose is lost in your urine and you may become dehydrated.\nTypical symptoms include:\n- feeling very thirsty\n- passing urine more often than usual, particularly at night\n- feeling very tired all the time\n- weight loss and loss of muscle bulk\n- persistent infections such as thrush\nThe symptoms of type 1 diabetes usually develop very quickly in young people (over a few hours or days). In adults, the symptoms often take longer to develop (a few days or weeks).\nRead more about the symptoms of type 1 diabetes\nType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition, where the immune system (the body&#8217;s natural defence against infection and illness) mistakes the cells in your pancreas as harmful and attacks them.\nWithout insulin, your body will break down its own fat and muscle, resulting in weight loss. This can lead to a serious short-term condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. This is when the bloodstream becomes acidic, you develop dangerous levels of ketones in your blood stream and become severely dehydrated.\nThis results in the body being unable to produce insulin, which is required to move glucose out of the blood and into your cells to be used for energy. This is called Type 1 diabetes.\nRead more about the causes of type 1 diabetes\nIt&#8217;s important that diabetes is diagnosed as early as possible.&nbsp;If left untreated, type-1 diabetes is a life-threatening condition. It&#8217;s essential that treatment is started early.\nDiabetes can&#8217;t be cured, but treatment aims to keep your blood glucose levels as normal as possible and control your symptoms, to prevent health problems developing later in life.\nIf you&#8217;re diagnosed with diabetes, you&#8217;ll be referred to a diabetes care team for specialist treatment and monitoring.\nAs your body can&#8217;t produce insulin, you&#8217;ll need regular insulin injections to keep your glucose levels normal. You&#8217;ll be taught how to do this and how to match the insulin you inject to the food (carbohydrate) you eat, taking into account your blood glucose level and how much exercise you do.\nInsulin injections come in several different forms, with each working slightly differently. You&#8217;ll most likely need a combination of different insulin preparations.\nInsulin is given to some patients by a continuous infusion of fast (rapid)&nbsp;acting insulin (pump therapy). This is where a small device constantly pumps insulin (at a rate you control) into your bloodstream through a plastic tube (cannula) that&#8217;s inserted under the skin with a needle.\nThere are alternatives to insulin injections and pumps, but they&#8217;re only suitable for a small number of patients. They are:\n- islet cell transplantation – where healthy insulin-producing cells from the pancreas of a deceased donor are implanted into the pancreas of someone with type 1 diabetes\n- a complete pancreas transplant – this is still relatively rare and only a few centres of excellence offer this.\nRead more about diagnosing diabetes and treating type 1 diabetes\nIf diabetes is left untreated, it can cause a number of different health problems. Large amounts of glucose can damage blood vessels, nerves and organs.\nHaving a consistently&nbsp;raised glucose level that doesn&#8217;t cause any symptoms can have damaging effects in the long term.\nThere is also complications that can arise if your insulin is not balanced with your food intake and exercise. Your diabetes team will work with you to manage your insulin correctly.\nRead more about the complications of type 1 diabetes\nIf you have type 1 diabetes, you&#8217;ll need to look after your health very carefully. Caring for your health will also make treating your diabetes easier and minimise your risk of developing complications.\nFor example, eating a healthy, balanced diet and exercising regularly will lower your blood glucose level. Stopping smoking (if you smoke) will also reduce your risk of developing cardiovascular disease.\nYour healthcare team will discuss this with you, and you can see your own results through My Diabetes My Way. It&#8217;s important that you learn the skills to self manage your diabetes and there are people to help and support you to do this.\nIf you have diabetes, your eyes are at risk from diabetic retinopathy, a condition that can lead to sight loss if it&#8217;s not treated. Everyone with diabetes aged 12 or over should be invited to have their eyes screened&nbsp;once a year.\nRead more about living with type 1 diabetes\nThe symptoms of type 1 diabetes should disappear when you start taking insulin and you get the condition under control.\nThe main symptoms of diabetes&nbsp;are:\n- feeling very&nbsp;thirsty\n- urinating more frequently than usual, particularly at night\n- feeling very tired\n- weight loss and loss of muscle bulk\n- itchiness around the genital area, or regular bouts of thrush&nbsp;(a yeast infection)\n- blurred vision caused by the lens of your eye changing shape\nVomiting or heavy, deep breathing can also occur at a later stage. This is a dangerous sign and requires immediate admission to hospital for treatment.\nYou should seek urgent medical attention if you have diabetes and develop:\n- a loss of appetite\n- nausea or vomiting\n- a high temperature\n- stomach pain\n- fruity smelling breath – which may smell like pear drops or nail varnish (some people can smell this themselves)\nIf you have diabetes, your blood glucose levels can become very low. This is known as hypoglycaemia (or a &#8220;hypo&#8221;).\nIn most cases, hypoglycaemia occurs as a result of taking too much insulin, although it can also develop if you skip a meal, exercise very vigorously or drink alcohol&nbsp;on an empty stomach.\nSymptoms of a &#8220;hypo&#8221; include:\n- feeling shaky and irritable\n- sweating\n- tingling lips\n- feeling weak\n- feeling confused\n- hunger\n- nausea (feeling sick)\nA hypo can be brought under control simply by eating or drinking something sugary.\nIf it isn&#8217;t brought under control, a hypo can cause confusion, slurred speech and, eventually, unconsciousness.\nIn this case, an emergency injection of a hormone called glucagon will be needed. Glucagon increases the glucose in your blood.&nbsp;Your diabetes team will advise you in more detail about avoiding, recognising and treating a hypo.\nAs diabetes occurs as a result of your body being unable to produce any, or enough, insulin to regulate your blood glucose, your blood glucose levels may become very high. This happens because there&#8217;s insufficient insulin to move glucose out of your bloodstream and into your cells to produce energy.\nIf your blood glucose levels become too high, you may experience hyperglycaemia. The symptoms of hyperglycaemia are similar to the main symptoms of diabetes, but they may come on suddenly and be more severe. They include:\n- extreme thirst\n- a dry mouth\n- blurred vision\n- drowsiness\n- a need to pass urine frequently\nLeft untreated or if you already have an infection, hyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. This is a life-threatening&nbsp;condition, where the body breaks down fat and muscle as an alternative source of energy. This leads to a build-up of acids in your blood, which can cause vomiting, dehydration, unconsciousness and even death.\nYour healthcare team will teach you about looking out for these symptoms and how to manage your &#8216;Sick Day&#8217; rules.\nThe Diabetes UK website has more information about type 1&nbsp;diabetes symptoms.\nType 1 diabetes occurs when the body is unable to produce insulin. Insulin is a hormone that&#8217;s needed to control the amount of glucose (sugar) in your blood.\nWhen you eat, your digestive system breaks down food and passes its nutrients – including glucose – into your bloodstream.\nThe pancreas (a small gland behind your stomach) usually produces insulin, which transfers any glucose out of your blood and into your cells, where it&#8217;s converted to energy.\nHowever, if you have type 1 diabetes, your pancreas is unable to produce any insulin (see below). This means that glucose can&#8217;t be moved out of your bloodstream and into your cells.\nType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition. Your immune system (the body&#8217;s natural defence against infection and illness) mistakes the cells in your pancreas as harmful and attacks them, destroying them completely or damaging them enough to stop them producing insulin.\nIt&#8217;s not known exactly what triggers the immune system to do this, but some researchers have suggested that it may be due to a viral infection.\nType 1 diabetes is often inherited (runs in families), so the autoimmune reaction may also be genetic.\nIf you have a close relative – such as a parent, brother or sister – with type 1 diabetes, you have about a 6% chance of also developing the condition. The risk for people who don&#8217;t have a close relative with type 1 diabetes is just under 0.5%.\nRead&nbsp;about diagnosing type 1 diabetes\nIf you experience the symptoms of diabetes, you should visit your GP as soon as possible. They&#8217;ll ask about your symptoms and may request a urine and blood test.\nYour urine sample will be tested to see whether it contains glucose. Urine doesn&#8217;t usually contain glucose, but if you have diabetes, some glucose can overflow through the kidneys and into the urine. Your urine may also be tested for ketones (chemicals) that indicate type 1 diabetes.\nThe GP may do a finger prick blood test for glucose and ketones. A sample will be sent to the laboratory to confirm the diagnosis. These results will be discussed with the specialist diabetes service if there is concern you have Type 1 Diabetes.\nThe glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) test is another blood test that can be used to diagnose diabetes.nd to monitor our long-term diabetes control.\nIn people who&#8217;ve already been diagnosed with diabetes, the HbA1c test is often used to show how well their diabetes is being controlled.\nThe HbA1c test gives your average blood glucose level over the previous two to three months. The results can indicate whether the measures you&#8217;re taking to control your diabetes are working.\nIf you&#8217;ve been diagnosed with diabetes, it&#8217;s recommended that you have your HbA1c measured at least twice a year. However, you may need to have your HbA1c measured more frequently if:\n- you&#8217;ve recently been diagnosed with diabetes\n- your blood glucose remains too high\n- your treatment plan has been changed\n- you&#8217;re planning a pregnancy\nUnlike other tests, the HbA1c test can be carried out at any time of day and doesn&#8217;t require any special preparation, such as fasting. However, it&#8217;s less reliable in certain situations, such as during pregnancy.\nThe advantages associated with the HbA1c test make it the preferred method of assessing how well blood glucose levels are being controlled in a person with diabetes.\nRead about treating type 1 diabetes\nAn important part of your treatment is to make sure that your blood glucose level is as normal and stable as possible.\nYou&#8217;ll be able to manage this using insulin treatment and by eating a healthy, balanced diet, but you will also have to regularly check your blood glucose levels to make sure they&#8217;re not too high or too low.\nExercise, illness, stress, drinking alcohol, taking other medicines and, for women, changes to your hormone levels during your monthly period can all affect your blood glucose levels.\nIn most cases, you&#8217;ll need to check your blood glucose levels during the day, both at home and at work or school, using a simple finger prick blood test. You may need to do this up to four or more times a day, depending on the type of insulin treatment you&#8217;re taking. There are different methods of checking your blood glucose that doesn&#8217;t involve pricking your finger. Discuss your options with your diabetes care team.\nThe normal blood glucose level is 4-7 mmol/l before meals and less than 8.5 mmol/l two hours after meals. Mmol/l means millimoles per litre, and it&#8217;s a way of defining the concentration of glucose in your blood.\nThere is another method to check glucose levels without pricking your finger. This is called a flash glucose monitor&nbsp;(Freestyle Libre).\nThe Diabetes UK website has more information on testing your glucose levels.\nYou&#8217;ll be measuring your blood glucose yourself every day, to check your levels.\nYour GP or diabetes care team will also carry out a different blood test every two to six months, called the HbA1c test.\nThis gives a clearer idea of how well your treatment plan is working, by measuring how stable your glucose levels have been over the past 6-12 weeks.\nIt measures the amount of haemoglobin, which is the oxygen-carrying substance in red blood cells that has glucose attached to it. A high HbA1c level may indicate that your blood glucose level is consistently high and that your diabetes treatment plan needs to be altered.\nThe ideal HbA1c target for people with diabetes is below 53 mmol/mol.\nHypoglycaemia can occur when your blood glucose level becomes very low. It&#8217;s likely that you&#8217;ll develop hypoglycaemia from time to time.\nMild hypoglycaemia (or a &#8220;hypo&#8221;) can make you feel shaky, weak and hungry, and can be controlled by eating or drinking something sugary, such as:\n- 200ml pure fruit juice\n- 5 to 7 Dextrose tablets\n- 4 to 5 Glucotabs\n- 60ml Glucojuice\n- 5 jelly babies\nYou may also be able to take pure glucose, in the form of a tablet or fluid, if you need to control the symptoms of a hypo quickly.\nIf you develop severe hypoglycaemia, you can become drowsy and confused, and you may even lose consciousness. If this occurs, you&#8217;ll need assistance from another person who may be able to give you a glucose gel rubbed into your cheeks or an injection of glucagon into your muscle. Glucagon is a hormone that quickly increases your blood glucose levels.\nYour diabetes care team may show several of your family members and close friends how to inject glucagon or give you glucose gel, should you need it.\nOnce you begin to come round, you&#8217;ll need to eat something sugary when you&#8217;re alert enough to do so. If you lose consciousness as a result of hypoglycaemia, there&#8217;s a risk that it could happen again within a few hours. You&#8217;ll need to rest afterwards and have someone with you to ensure that you eat some food to replace the glucose stores in your body.\nIf the glucagon injection into your muscle doesn&#8217;t work, and you&#8217;re still drowsy or unconscious 10 minutes after the injection, you&#8217;ll need urgent medical attention.\nYou&#8217;ll need to have an injection of dextrose straight into a vein, which must be given by a trained healthcare professional.\nIf you have type 1 diabetes, it&#8217;s recommended that you carry identification with you so that people are aware of the problem if you become hypoglycaemic.\nIf significant hypoglycaemia is a regular problem or you have lost your awareness of hypoglycaemia your health care team may consider using a continuous glucose monitor (CGM).\nSome people with type 1 diabetes may benefit from a fairly new procedure known as islet cell transplantation. It involves implanting healthy islet cells from the pancreas of a deceased donor into the pancreas of someone with type 1 diabetes.\nIn 2008, a government-funded islet cell transplant programme was introduced, and the procedure is now available through the NHS for people who satisfy certain criteria (see below).\nYou may be suitable for an islet cell transplant if you&#8217;ve had:\n- two or more severe hypos within the last two years and you have a poor awareness of hypoglycaemia\n- a working kidney transplant, severe hypos and poor hypoglycaemia awareness, or poor blood glucose control even after receiving the best medical treatment\nYou may not be suitable for an islet cell transplant if you:\n- weigh over 85kg (13st 5.4lb)\n- have poor kidney function\n- need a lot of insulin – for example, over 50 units a day for a 70kg (11st) person\nAn islet cell transplant is a minor, low-risk procedure that&#8217;s carried out under local anaesthetic.\nThe procedure has been shown to be effective at reducing the risk of severe hypos. So far, the results of islet cell transplants carried out in the UK have shown a significant reduction in the number of hypos, from 23 per person per year before transplantation to less than one per person per year afterwards.\nPeople with type 1 diabetes who are having a kidney transplant from a donor may also be offered a pancreas transplant at the same time.\nOthers may be offered a pancreas transplant after they&#8217;ve had a kidney transplant because they’re already on anti-rejection tablets.\nIf you&#8217;re having repeated, severe and life-threatening hypoglycaemic attacks, a pancreas transplant may also be recommended.\nDuring the procedure, your faulty pancreas will be replaced with a healthy pancreas from a donor. This will allow you to get a new source of insulin.\nPancreas transplants are complicated operations and, like other types of major surgery, there&#8217;s a risk of complications. In the UK, about 200 pancreas transplants are carried out each year, with more than 300 people on the waiting list.\nThe waiting time for a pancreas transplant is one to two years, because there&#8217;s a shortage of suitable donor organs.\nHyperglycaemia can occur when your blood glucose levels become too high. It can happen for several reasons, such as eating too much, being unwell or not taking enough insulin.\nIf you develop hyperglycaemia, you may need to adjust your diet or your insulin dose to keep your glucose levels normal. Your diabetes care team can advise you about the best way to do this.\nIf hyperglycaemia isn&#8217;t treated, it can lead to a condition called diabetic ketoacidosis, where the body begins to break down fats for energy instead of glucose, resulting in a build-up of ketones (acids) in your blood.\nDiabetic ketoacidosis is very serious and, if not addressed quickly, it can lead to unconsciousness and, eventually, death.\nThe signs of diabetic ketoacidosis include:\n- frequently passing urine\n- thirst\n- tiredness and lethargy (lack of energy)\n- blurry vision\n- abdominal (stomach) pain\n- nausea and vomiting\n- deep breathing\n- smell of ketones on breath (described as smelling like pear drops)\n- collapse and unconsciousness\nRead more about the symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis\nYour healthcare team will educate you on how to decrease your risk of ketoacidosis by testing your own blood for ketones using blood ketone sticks if you&#8217;re unwell.\nIf you develop diabetic ketoacidosis, you&#8217;ll need urgent hospital treatment. You&#8217;ll be given insulin directly into a vein (intravenously). You may also need other fluids given by a drip if you&#8217;re dehydrated, including salt solution and potassium.\nType 1 diabetes can lead to long-term complications. If you have the condition, you have an increased risk of developing heart disease, stroke, eye&nbsp;and kidney disease. To reduce the chance of this, you may be advised to take:\n- anti-hypertensive medicines to control high blood pressure\n- a statin – such as simvastatin – to reduce high cholesterol levels\n- low-dose aspirin to prevent stroke\n- angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor – such as enalapril, lisinopril or ramipril if you have the early signs of diabetic kidney disease\nDiabetic kidney disease is identified by the presence of small amounts of a protein called albumin in your urine. It&#8217;s often reversible if treated early enough.\nThe aim of treating diabetes is to help people with the condition control their blood glucose levels and minimise the risk of developing future complications.\nIn Scotland there is a National Diabetes Improvement Plan produced by the Scottish Diabetes Group, patients and health care professionals.&nbsp;\nThe Diabetes National Service Framework&nbsp;has also been developed by diabetes clinical experts and patients with diabetes. Good diabetes care includes:\n- access to information and appropriate support for people with type 1 diabetes, including access to a structured education programme\n- an agreed care plan, helping all people with diabetes to manage their care and lead a healthy lifestyle – including a named contact for their care\n- information, care and support to enable all people with diabetes to control their blood glucose, maintain an acceptable blood pressure and minimise other risk factors for developing complications\n- access to services to identify and treat possible complications – such as screening for diabetic retinopathy (where high blood glucose levels damage the retina at the back of the eye) and specialised foot care\n- effective care for all people with diabetes admitted to hospital, for whatever reason\nIf diabetes isn&#8217;t treated, it can lead to a number of different health problems. High glucose levels can damage blood vessels, nerves and organs.\nA consistently raised glucose level that doesn&#8217;t cause any symptoms can have damaging effects in the long term.\nIf you have diabetes, you&#8217;re up to five times more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke.\nProlonged, poorly controlled blood glucose levels increase the likelihood of developing atherosclerosis (furring and narrowing of your blood vessels).\nThis may result in a poor blood supply to your heart or to your lower limbs, causing angina (a dull, heavy or tight pain in the chest) or claudication (pain in the back of your calves when walking). It also increases the chance that a blood vessel in your heart or brain will become completely blocked, leading to a heart attack or stroke.\nHigh blood glucose levels can damage the tiny blood vessels of your nerves. This can cause a tingling or burning pain that spreads from your fingers and toes up through your limbs. If the nerves in your digestive system are affected, you may experience nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or constipation.\nRetinopathy&nbsp;is where the retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue) at the back of the eye is damaged. Blood vessels in the retina can become blocked or leaky, or can grow haphazardly. This prevents the light from fully passing through to your retina. If it isn&#8217;t treated, it can damage your vision.\nThe better you control your blood glucose levels, the lower your risk of developing serious eye problems. Having an annual eye check with a specialist (an ophthalmologist or optometrist) can help pick up signs of a potentially serious eye problem early so that it can be treated.\nTreatment for diabetic retinopathy is only necessary if screening detects significant problems that mean your vision is at risk.\nIf the condition hasn&#8217;t reached this stage, the advice on managing your diabetes, BP and cholesterol level is recommended.\nThe main treatments for more advanced diabetic retinopathy are:\n- laser treatment\n- injections of medication into your eyes\n- an operation to remove blood or scar tissue from your eyes\nRead about diabetic eye screening\nIf the small blood vessels in your kidney become blocked and leaky, your kidneys will work less efficiently.\nIn rare, severe cases, this can lead to kidney failure&nbsp;and the need for dialysis (treatment to replicate the functions of the kidneys). In some cases, a kidney transplant may be necessary.\nDamage to the nerves of the foot can mean that small nicks and cuts aren&#8217;t noticed, which can lead to a foot ulcer developing. About 1 in 10 people with diabetes get a foot ulcer, which can cause serious infection.\nIf you develop nerve damage, you should check your feet every day and report any changes to your doctor, nurse or podiatrist. Look out for sores and cuts that don&#8217;t heal, puffiness or swelling, and skin that feels hot to the touch. You should also have a foot examination at least once a year.\nIn men with diabetes, particularly those who smoke, nerve and blood vessel damage can lead to erection problems. This can usually be treated with medication.\nWomen with diabetes may experience:\n- a reduced sex drive (loss of libido)\n- reduced pleasure from sex\n- vaginal dryness\n- a reduced ability to orgasm\n- pain during sex\nIf you experience a lack of vaginal lubrication, or you find sex painful, you can use a vaginal lubricant or a water-based gel.\nPregnant women with diabetes have an increased risk of miscarriage and stillbirth. If your blood glucose level isn&#8217;t carefully controlled immediately before and during early pregnancy, there&#8217;s also an increased risk of the baby developing a serious birth defect.\nPregnant women with diabetes will usually have their antenatal check-ups in hospital or a diabetes clinic. This allows doctors to keep a close eye on their blood glucose levels and control their insulin dosage more easily.\nRead more about diabetes and pregnancy:\n- Diabetes UK\n- My Diabetes My Way\nHaving diabetes means that you&#8217;re more likely to develop problems with your feet, including foot ulcers and infections from minor cuts and grazes. This is because blood glucose can damage the nerves in your feet.\nTo prevent problems with your feet, keep your nails short and wash your feet daily using warm water. Wear shoes that fit properly and see a podiatrist or chiropodist (a foot care specialist) regularly so that any problems are detected early.\nRegularly check your feet for cuts, blisters&nbsp;or grazes because you may not be able to feel them if the nerves in your feet are damaged. See your GP if you have a minor foot injury that doesn&#8217;t start to heal within a few days.\nThe Diabetes UK website has more information and advice about&nbsp;taking care of your feet.\nIf you have type 1 diabetes, you should be invited to have your your eyes screened at once a year to check for diabetic retinopathy.\nRetinopathy is an eye condition where the small blood vessels in your eye become damaged. It can occur if your blood glucose level is too high for a long time (hyperglycaemia). If it isn&#8217;t treated, retinopathy can eventually cause sight loss.\nRead more about&nbsp;diabetic eye screening\nIf you need to take insulin to control your diabetes, you should have received instructions about looking after yourself when you&#8217;re ill – known as your &#8220;sick day rules&#8221;.\nContact your diabetes care team or GP for advice if you haven&#8217;t received these.\nThe advice you&#8217;re given will be specific to you, but some general measures that your sick day rules may include could be to:\n- keep taking your insulin – it&#8217;s very important&nbsp;not&nbsp;to stop treatment when you&#8217;re ill; your treatment plan may state whether you need to temporarily increase your dose\n- test your blood glucose level more often than usual – most people are advised to check the level at least four times a day\n- keep yourself well hydrated – make sure you drink plenty of sugar-free drinks\n- keep eating – eat solid food if you feel well enough to, or liquid carbohydrates such as milk, soup and yoghurt if this is easier\n- check your ketone levels if your blood glucose level is high\nSeek advice from your diabetes care team or GP if your blood glucose or ketone level remains high after taking insulin, if:\n- you&#8217;re not sure whether to make any changes to your treatment\n- you develop symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis\n- you have any other concerns\nIf you have diabetes and you&#8217;re thinking about having a baby, it&#8217;s a good idea to discuss this with your diabetes care team.\nA planned pregnancy enables you to make sure your blood glucose levels are as well controlled as possible before you get pregnant.&nbsp;Most women with diabetes have a healthy baby.\nYou&#8217;ll need to keep your blood glucose under tight control, particularly before becoming pregnant and during the first eight weeks of pregnancy, to reduce the risk of the baby developing serious birth defects.\nYou should also take a higher dose of folic acid&nbsp;tablets. Folic acid helps prevent your baby developing spinal cord problems. Doctors now recommend that all women planning to have a baby take folic acid. Women with diabetes are advised to take 5mg a day until they&#8217;re 12 weeks pregnant (only available on prescription).&nbsp;\nFolic acid should be taken alongside pregnancy multivitamins that include&nbsp;vitamin D. Insulin and metformin are safe to take during pregnancy. It&#8217;s important to review any other medications you take to ensure these are safe to take during pregnancy.\nYou should also have your eyes checked. Retinopathy (see above) affects the blood vessels in the eyes and is a risk for all people with diabetes. Pregnancy can place extra pressure on the small vessels in your eyes, so it&#8217;s important to treat retinopathy before you become pregnant.\nYour GP or diabetes care team can give you further advice.&nbsp;Diabetes UK&nbsp; and&nbsp;JDRF&nbsp;also provide more useful information about&nbsp;pregnancy and diabetes&nbsp;to help you get your pregnancy off to a healthy start.\nYou&#8217;ll be best equipped to manage your diabetes if you&#8217;re given information and education when you&#8217;re diagnosed, and then on an ongoing basis.\nThe&nbsp;National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)&nbsp;strongly recommends that all people who have diabetes should be offered a structured patient education programme, providing information and education to help them care for themselves.\nThis gives people the best chance of developing the skills they need to effectively treat their condition, maintain their glucose levels at a normal level and help prevent long-term complications. It also reduces the risk of developing hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose levels).\nStructured patient education means there&#8217;s a planned course that:\n- covers all aspects of diabetes\n- is flexible in content\n- is relevant to a person’s clinical and psychological needs\n- is adaptable to a person’s educational and cultural background\nThere are also several local adult education programmes, many of which are working towards the criteria for structured education. Ask your diabetes care team about the adult education programmes they provide.\nFor a parent whose child is diagnosed with a life-long condition, the job of parenting becomes even tougher.\nAlthough being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes will involve coming to terms with the diagnosis, getting used to treatment and making&nbsp;changes to&nbsp;everyday life, your child can still lead a normal and healthy life.\nThe&nbsp;Diabetes UK&nbsp;website has information and advice about&nbsp;your child and diabetes.\nMany people find it helpful to talk to others in a similar position, and you may find support from a group for people with diabetes. Patient organisations have local groups where you can meet others who&#8217;ve been diagnosed with the condition.\nThe Diabetes UK website enables you to&nbsp;find your local diabetes support group. If you want to contact a trained counsellor directly, you can phone Diabetes UK’s care line on 0345 123 2399, or email&nbsp;helpline.scotland@diabetes.org.uk\nFurther information on Helpline Scotland\nSome people with diabetes may be eligible to receive disability benefits and incapacity benefits, depending on the impact the condition has on their life.\nThe main groups likely to qualify for welfare benefits are children, elderly people, people with learning disabilities or mental health problems, and those with&nbsp;complications of diabetes.\nPeople over 65 who are severely disabled, may qualify for a type of disability benefit called&nbsp;Attendance Allowance.\nCarers may also be entitled to some benefit too, depending on their involvement in caring for the person with diabetes.\nStaff at your local&nbsp;Citizen’s Advice Scotland&nbsp;can check whether you&#8217;re getting all of the benefits you&#8217;re entitled to. Both they and your diabetes specialist nurse should also be able to give you advice about filling in the forms.\nIt&#8217;s a common myth that people with diabetes aren&#8217;t allowed to drive anymore. Although there are some restrictions on drivers with diabetes, it&#8217;s not as severe as you may think.\nYou should always tell your insurer that you are diabetic as this may affect your insurance claim. Only individuals who use insulin have to tell the DVLA that they have diabetes. A high majority of individuals who use insulin can carry on driving on a restricted licence. This usually has to be renewed every 3 years.\nAdditional restictions may apply for different licences (e.g Group 2 HGV) so always refer to the&nbsp;DVLA guidelines.\nUnfortunately, some individuals do lose their driving license, most commonly due to experiencing severe hypos or being unable to recognise symptoms of a hypo (hypo unawareness).\nTo prevent hypos whilst driving you should\n- check your blood glucose levels before driving\n- keep medication close by in the car\n- take regular breaks on long journeys over 2 hours\n- avoid missing meals\nFor more information about driving with diabetes, visit&nbsp;Diabetes UK."

        "description": "Diabetes is usually a lifelong condition that causes a person&#8217;s blood glucose (sugar) level to become too high.\nThe hormone insulin – produced by the pancreas – is responsible for controlling the amount of glucose in the blood\nThere are two main types of diabetes:\n- type 1 – where the pancreas doesn&#8217;t produce any insulin\n- type 2 – where the pancreas doesn&#8217;t produce enough insulin or the body&#8217;s cells don&#8217;t react to insulin\nThis topic is about type 2 diabetes.\nRead more about type 1 diabetes\nAnother type of diabetes, known as gestational diabetes, occurs in some pregnant women and tends to disappear after birth.\nThe symptoms of diabetes occur because the lack of insulin means glucose stays in the blood and isn&#8217;t used as fuel for energy.\nYour body tries to reduce blood glucose levels by getting rid of the excess glucose in your urine.\nTypical symptoms include:\n- feeling very thirsty\n- passing urine more often than usual, particularly at night\n- feeling very tired\n- weight loss and loss of muscle bulk\n- slow to heal cuts or ulcers\n- frequent vaginal or penile thrush\n- blurred vision\nRead more about the symptoms of type 2 diabetes\nIt&#8217;s very important for diabetes to be diagnosed as soon as possible as it will get progressively worse if left untreated.\nType 2 diabetes occurs when the body doesn&#8217;t produce enough insulin to function properly, or the body&#8217;s cells don&#8217;t react to insulin. This means glucose stays in the blood and isn&#8217;t used as fuel for energy.\nType 2 diabetes is often associated with obesity and tends to be diagnosed in older people. Due to increased obesity, type 2 diabetes is now being seen in young people and all ages. It&#8217;s far more common than type 1 diabetes.\nRead about the causes and risk factors for type 2 diabetes\nType 2 diabetes is treated with changes in your diet and depending on the response of your blood glucose levels, sometimes tablets and insulin. Early in the course of type 2 diabetes, planned weight loss can even reverse the disease.\nRead more about the treatment of type 2 diabetes\nDiabetes can cause serious long-term health problems. It&#8217;s the most common cause of vision loss and blindness in people of working age.\nEveryone with diabetes aged 12 or over should be invited to have their eyes screened once a year for diabetic retinopathy.\nDiabetes is also responsible for most cases of kidney failure&nbsp;and lower limb amputation, other than accidents.\nRead more about the complications of type 2 diabetes\nIf you&#8217;re at risk of type 2 diabetes, you may be able to prevent it developing by making lifestyle changes.\nThese include:\n- losing weight if you&#8217;re overweight, and maintaining a healthy weight\n- eating a healthy, balanced diet\n- stopping smoking if you smoke\n- drinking alcohol in moderation\n- taking plenty of regular exercise\nIf you already have type 2 diabetes, it may be possible to control your symptoms by making the above changes. This also minimises your risk of developing complications.\nRead more about living with type 2 diabetes\nThe symptoms of diabetes include feeling very thirsty, passing more urine than usual, and feeling tired all the time.\nThe symptoms occur because some or all of the glucose stays in your blood and isn&#8217;t used as fuel for energy. Your body tries to get rid of the excess glucose in your urine.\nThe main symptoms of&nbsp;type 2 diabetes are:\n- urinating more often than usual, particularly at night\n- feeling very thirsty\n- feeling very tired\n- unexplained weight loss\n- itchiness around the genital area, or regular bouts of thrush&nbsp;(a yeast infection)\n- cuts or wounds that heal slowly\n- blurred vision – caused by the lens of the eye becoming dry\nThe signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes are usually obvious and develop very quickly, often over a few weeks.\nThese signs and symptoms aren&#8217;t always as obvious, however, and it&#8217;s often diagnosed during a routine check-up.\nThis is because they are often mild and develop gradually over a number of years. This means you may have type 2 diabetes for many years without realising it.\nEarly diagnosis and treatment for type 2 diabetes is very important as it may reduce your risk of developing complications later on.\nType 2 diabetes occurs when the pancreas, a large gland behind the stomach, can&#8217;t produce enough insulin to control your blood glucose level, or when the cells in your body don&#8217;t respond properly to the insulin that is produced.\nThis means your blood glucose levels may become very high, and is known as hyperglycaemia.\nHyperglycaemia can occur for several reasons, including:\n- eating too much\n- being unwell\n- ineffective diabetes medication\n- not taking enough medication\nHyperglycaemia causes the main symptoms of diabetes, which include extreme thirst and frequent urination.\nType 2 diabetes occurs when the pancreas doesn&#8217;t produce enough insulin to maintain a normal blood glucose level, or the body is unable to use the insulin that is produced (insulin resistance).\nThe pancreas is a large gland behind the stomach that produces the hormone insulin. Insulin moves glucose from your blood into your cells, where it&#8217;s converted into energy.\nIn type 2 diabetes, there are several reasons why the pancreas doesn&#8217;t produce enough insulin.\nFour of the main risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes are:\n- age – being over the age of 40 (over 25 for south Asian people)\n- genetics – having a close relative with the condition, such as a parent, brother or sister\n- weight – being overweight or obese\n- ethnicity – being of south Asian, Chinese, African-Caribbean or black African origin, even if you were born in the UK\nYour risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases with age. This may be because people tend to gain weight and exercise less as they get older.\nMaintaining a healthy weight by eating a&nbsp;healthy, balanced diet&nbsp;and&nbsp;exercising regularly&nbsp;are ways of preventing and managing diabetes.\nWhite people over the age of 40 have an increased risk of developing the condition. People of south Asian, Chinese, African-Caribbean and black African descent have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes at a much earlier age.\nHowever, despite increasing age being a risk factor for type 2 diabetes, over recent years younger people from all ethnic groups have been developing the condition.\nIt&#8217;s also becoming more common for children – as young as seven in some cases – to develop type 2 diabetes, mainly due to rising obesity levels.\nGenetics is one of the main risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Your risk of developing the condition is increased if you have a close relative such as a parent, brother or sister who has the condition.\nThe closer the relative, the greater the risk. A child who has a parent with type 2 diabetes has about a one in three chance of also developing the condition.\nYou&#8217;re more likely to develop type 2 diabetes if you&#8217;re overweight or obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more.\nFat around your tummy (abdomen) particularly increases your risk. This is because it releases chemicals that can upset the body&#8217;s cardiovascular and metabolic systems.\nThis increases your risk of developing a number of serious conditions, including&nbsp;coronary heart disease,&nbsp;stroke&nbsp;and some types of&nbsp;cancer.\nMeasuring your waist is a quick way of assessing your diabetes risk. This is a measure of abdominal&nbsp;obesity, which is a particularly high-risk form of obesity.\nWomen have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes if their waist measures 80cm (31.5 inches) or more.\nAsian men with a waist size of 89cm (35 inches) or more have a higher risk, as do white or black men with a waist size of 94cm (37 inches) or more.\nExercising regularly and reducing your body weight by about 5% could reduce your risk of getting diabetes by more than 50%.\nRead about&nbsp;measuring your waist size\nPeople of south Asian, Chinese, African-Caribbean and black African origin are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes.\nType 2 diabetes is up to six times more common in south Asian communities than in the general UK population, and it&#8217;s three times more common among people of African and African-Caribbean origin.\nPeople of south Asian and African-Caribbean origin also have an increased risk of developing&nbsp;complications of type 2 diabetes, such as heart disease, at a younger age than the rest of the population.\nYour risk of developing type 2 diabetes is also increased if your blood glucose level is higher than normal, but not yet high enough to be diagnosed with diabetes.\nThis is sometimes called pre-diabetes, and doctors sometimes call it impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Pre-diabetes is reversible if you lose weight. Discuss your options with your GP.\nPre-diabetes can progress to type 2 diabetes if you don&#8217;t take preventative steps, such as making lifestyle changes. These include&nbsp;eating healthily,&nbsp;losing weight&nbsp;if you&#8217;re overweight, and taking plenty of&nbsp;regular exercise.\nWomen who have had gestational diabetes during pregnancy also have a greater risk of developing diabetes in later life.\nType 2 diabetes is a progressive condition and&nbsp;usually gets worse over time. Making lifestyle changes, such as adjusting your diet and taking more exercise, may help you control your blood glucose levels at first, but may not be enough in the long term.\nYou may eventually need to take medication to help control your blood glucose levels.\nInitially, this will usually be in the form of tablets and can sometimes be a combination of more than one type of tablet. It may also include insulin or another medication that you inject.\nMetformin is usually the first medicine used to treat type 2 diabetes. It works by reducing the amount of glucose your liver releases into your bloodstream. It also makes your body&#8217;s cells more responsive to insulin.\nIf you&#8217;re overweight, it&#8217;s also likely you&#8217;ll be prescribed metformin. Unlike some other medicines used to treat type 2 diabetes, metformin shouldn&#8217;t cause additional weight gain.\nHowever, it can sometimes cause mild side effects, such as nausea and diarrhoea, and you may not be able to take it if you have kidney damage.\nSGLT2 inhibitors work by increasing the amount of glucose excreted in urine. They&#8217;re particularly useful in people with type 2 diabetes and who have cardiac disease.\nThe three SGLT2 inhibitors that may be prescribed include:\n- dapagliflozin\n- canagliflozin\n- empagliflozin\nEach medication is taken as a tablet once a day. The main side effect is a higher risk of genital and urinary tract infections.\nIf you&#8217;re unwell and have a dehydrating illness (e.g. fever, vomiting or diarrhoea), it&#8217;s important you stop these medications. Get your glucose and ketone level checked by your healthcare professional to prevent diabetic ketoacidosis developing.\nGLP-1 agonists acts in a similar way to the natural hormone GLP-1 (see the section on gliptins, below).\nThey&#8217;re given by injection and boost your own&nbsp;insulin production when there are high blood glucose levels, reducing blood glucose without the risk of hypoglycaemia episodes (&#8220;hypos&#8221;). They&#8217;re also particularly useful for people with type 2 diabetes and cardiac disease.\nSulphonylureas increase the amount of insulin that&#8217;s produced by your pancreas.\nExamples include:\n- glibenclamide\n- gliclazide\n- glimepiride\n- glipizide\n- gliquidone\nYou may be prescribed one of these medicines if you can&#8217;t take metformin.\nAlternatively, you may be prescribed sulphonylurea and metformin if metformin doesn&#8217;t control blood glucose on its own.\nSulphonylureas can increase the risk of hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose) because they increase the amount of insulin in your body. They can sometimes cause side effects, including weight gain, nausea and diarrhoea.\nPioglitazone is a type of thiazolidinedione medicine (TZD), which make your body&#8217;s cells more sensitive to insulin so more glucose is taken from your blood.\nIt&#8217;s usually used in combination with other oral diabetes medication. It may cause weight gain and ankle swelling (oedema).\nYou shouldn&#8217;t take pioglitazone if you have heart failure or a high risk of bone fracture.\nGliptins work by preventing the breakdown of a naturally occurring hormone called GLP-1.\nGLP-1 helps the body produce insulin in response to high blood glucose levels, but is rapidly broken down.\nBy preventing this breakdown, the gliptins (linagliptin, saxagliptin, sitagliptin and vildagliptin) prevent high blood glucose levels, but don&#8217;t result in episodes of hypoglycaemia.\nYou may be prescribed a gliptin if you&#8217;re unable to take sulphonylureas or glitazones, or in combination with them. They&#8217;re not associated with weight gain&nbsp;and are often used with other oral diabetes medication for those who are obese.\nIf glucose-lowering tablets aren&#8217;t effective in controlling your blood glucose levels, you may need to have insulin treatment.\nThis can be taken instead of or alongside your tablets, depending on the dose and the way you take it.\nInsulin comes in several different preparations, and each works slightly differently.&nbsp;Your treatment may include a combination of these different insulin preparations.\nInsulin must be injected because it would be broken down in your stomach like food and unable to enter your bloodstream if it were taken as a tablet.\nIf you need to inject insulin, your diabetes care team will advise you about when you need to do it.\nThey will show you how to inject it yourself, and will also give you advice about storing your insulin and disposing of your needles properly.\nInsulin injections are given using either a syringe or an injection pen, also called an insulin pen (auto-injector). Most people need between two and four injections of insulin a day.\nYour GP practice&nbsp;or diabetes nurse will also teach a relative or a close friend how to inject the insulin properly.\nYou can read more about insulin and how to inject it on the Diabetes UK website.\nIf you have type 2 diabetes that&#8217;s controlled using insulin or certain types of tablets (e.g. sulfonylurea), you may experience episodes of hypoglycaemia.\nHypoglycaemia is where your blood glucose levels become very low.\nMild hypoglycaemia (a &#8220;hypo&#8221;) can make you feel shaky, weak and hungry, but it can usually be controlled by eating or drinking something sugary.\nIf you have a hypo, you should initially have a form of carbohydrate that will act quickly, such as a sugary drink or glucose tablets.\nThis should be followed by a longer-acting carbohydrate, such as a cereal bar, sandwich or piece of fruit.\nIn most cases, these measures will be enough to raise your blood glucose level to normal. You should aim for a hypo to be treated and to recheck your blood glucose level within 15 minutes.\nIf blood glucose still less than 4mmol/l then repeat the treatment using a fast acting carbohydrate. When your blood glucose returns to normal then have your longer acting carbohydrate.\nIf you develop severe hypoglycaemia, you may become drowsy and confused, and you may even lose consciousness.\nIf this occurs, you may need to have an injection of glucagon into your muscle or glucose into a vein. Glucagon is a hormone that quickly increases your blood glucose levels.\nYou may require input from a health care professional. If the glucagon is not successful, you may require an injection of dextrose into your vein.\nYour diabetes care team can advise you on how to avoid a hypo and what to do if you have one.\nIf you have type 2 diabetes, your risk of developing heart disease, stroke, foot problems, eye&nbsp;and kidney disease is increased.\nTo reduce your risk of developing other serious health conditions, you may be advised to take other medicines, including:\n- anti-hypertensive medicines to control high blood pressure\n- a statin, such as simvastatin or atorvastatin, to reduce high cholesterol\n- low-dose aspirin to prevent a stroke\n- an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, such as enalapril, lisinopril or ramipril, if you have the early signs of diabetic kidney disease\nDiabetic kidney disease is identified by the presence of small amounts of albumin (a protein) in your urine. If treated early enough, it may be reversible.\nIf you have type 2 diabetes, your GP or diabetes care team will need to take a reading of your blood glucose level about every two to six months.\nThis will show how stable your glucose levels have been in the recent past and how well your treatment plan is working.\nThe HbA1c test is used to measure blood glucose levels over the previous two to three months.\nHbA1c is a form of haemoglobin, the chemical that carries oxygen in red blood cells, which also has glucose attached to it.\nA high HbA1c level means that your blood glucose level has been consistently high over recent weeks, and your diabetes treatment plan may need to be changed.\nYour diabetes care team can help you set a target HbA1c level to aim for. This will usually be less than 53 mmol/mol (7%) or individualised as agreed with your diabetes team.\nRead more about the HbA1c test\nIf you have type 2 diabetes, as well as having your blood glucose level checked by a healthcare professional every two to six months, you may be advised to monitor your own blood glucose levels at home.\nEven if you have a healthy diet and are taking tablets or using insulin therapy, exercise, illness and stress can affect your blood glucose levels.\nOther factors that may affect your blood glucose levels include drinking alcohol, taking other medicines and, for women, hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle.\nA blood glucose meter is a small device that measures the concentration of glucose in your blood. It can be useful for detecting high blood glucose (hyperglycaemia) or low blood glucose (hypoglycaemia).\nIf blood glucose monitoring is recommended, you should be trained in how to use a blood glucose meter and what you should do if the reading is too high or too low.\nBlood glucose meters aren&#8217;t currently available for free on the NHS but, in some cases, blood monitoring strips may be. Ask a member of your diabetes care team if you&#8217;re unsure.\nRegularly monitoring your blood glucose levels will ensure your blood glucose is as normal and stable as possible.\nAs your blood glucose level is likely to vary throughout the day, you may need to check it several times a day, depending on the treatment you&#8217;re taking.\nIn home testing, blood glucose levels are usually measured by how many millimoles of glucose are in a litre of blood.\nA millimole is a measurement used to define the concentration of glucose in your blood. The measurement is expressed as millimoles per litre, or mmol/l for short.\nA normal blood glucose level is 4-7 mmol/l before meals (preprandial) and less than 8.5 mmol/l two hours after meals (postprandial), although this can vary from person to person.\nYour diabetes care team can discuss your blood glucose level with you in more detail. It&#8217;s important to know your individual targets.\nIf diabetes isn&#8217;t treated, it can lead to a number of other health problems.\nHigh glucose levels can damage blood vessels, nerves and organs.\nEven a mildly raised glucose level that doesn&#8217;t cause any symptoms can have long-term damaging effects.\nIf you have diabetes, you&#8217;re up to five times more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke.\nProlonged, poorly controlled blood glucose levels increase the likelihood of atherosclerosis, where the blood vessels become clogged up and narrowed by fatty substances.\nThis may result in a poor blood supply to your heart or to your lower limbs, causing angina (a dull, heavy or tight pain in the chest) or claudication (pain in the back of your calves when walking).\nIt also increases the chance that a blood vessel in your heart or brain will become blocked, leading to a heart attack or stroke.\nHigh blood glucose levels can damage the tiny blood vessels in your nerves.\nThis can cause a tingling or burning pain that spreads from your fingers and toes up through your limbs. It can also cause numbness, which can lead to ulceration of the feet.\nDamage to the peripheral nervous system, which includes all parts of the nervous system that lie outside the central nervous system, is known as peripheral neuropathy.\nIf the nerves in your digestive system are affected, you may experience nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea&nbsp;or constipation.\nDiabetic retinopathy&nbsp;is when the retina, the light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye, becomes damaged.\nBlood vessels in the retina can become blocked or leaky, or can grow haphazardly. This prevents light fully passing through to your retina. If it isn&#8217;t treated, it can damage your vision.\nAnnual eye checks are usually organised by a regional photographic unit. If significant damage is detected, you may be referred to a doctor who specialises in treating eye conditions (ophthalmologist) such as cataract and glaucoma.\nThe better you control your blood glucose levels, the lower your risk of developing serious eye problems.\nTreatment for diabetic retinopathy is only necessary if screening detects significant problems that mean your vision is at risk.\nIf the condition hasn&#8217;t reached this stage, the advice on managing your diabetes, BP and cholesterol level is recommended.\nThe main treatments for more advanced diabetic retinopathy are:\n- laser treatment\n- injections of medication into your eyes\n- an operation to remove blood or scar tissue from your eyes\nRead about diabetic eye screening.\nIf the small blood vessels of your kidney become blocked and leaky, your kidneys will work less efficiently.\nIt&#8217;s usually associated with high blood pressure, and treating this is a key part of management.\nIn rare, severe cases, kidney disease can lead to kidney failure. This can mean a kidney replacement, treatment with dialysis or sometimes kidney transplantation becomes necessary.\nDamage to the nerves of the foot can mean small nicks and cuts aren&#8217;t noticed and this, in combination with poor circulation, can lead to a foot ulcer.\nAbout 1 in 10 people with diabetes get a foot ulcer, which can cause a serious infection.\nIf you have diabetes, look out for sores and cuts that don&#8217;t heal, puffiness or swelling, and skin that feels hot to the touch. You should also have your feet examined at least once a year.\nIf poor circulation or nerve damage is detected, check your feet every day and report any changes to your doctor, nurse or podiatrist.\nIn men with diabetes, particularly those who smoke, nerve and blood vessel damage can lead to erection problems. This can usually be treated with medication.\nWomen with diabetes may experience:\n- reduced sex drive (loss of libido)\n- less pleasure from sex\n- vaginal dryness\n- less ability to orgasm\n- pain during sex\nIf you experience a lack of vaginal lubrication or find sex painful, you can use a vaginal lubricant or a water-based gel.\nPregnant women with diabetes have an increased risk of miscarriage and stillbirth.\nIf your blood glucose level isn&#8217;t carefully controlled during the early stages of pregnancy, there&#8217;s also an increased risk of the baby developing a birth defect.\nPregnant women with diabetes will usually have their antenatal check-ups in hospital or a diabetic clinic, ideally with a doctor who specialises in pregnancy care (an obstetrician).\nThis will allow your care team to keep a close eye on your blood glucose levels and control your insulin dosage more easily, as well as monitoring the growth and development of your baby.\nThe Diabetes UK website has more information about diabetes complications.\nThe NHS diabetic eye screening programme will arrange for you to have your eyes checked every year.\nEveryone who is on a diabetes register will be given the opportunity to have a digital picture taken of the back of their eye. Speak to your GP to register.\nIf you have diabetes, you&#8217;re at greater risk of developing problems with your feet, including foot ulcers and infections from minor cuts and grazes.\nThis is because diabetes is associated with poor blood circulation in the feet, and blood glucose can damage the nerves.\nTo prevent problems with your feet, keep your nails short and wash your feet daily using warm water.\nWear shoes that fit properly, and see foot care specialists (a podiatrist or chiropodist) regularly so any problems can be detected early.\nRegularly check your feet for cuts, blisters or grazes as you may not be able to feel them if the nerves in your feet are damaged.\nSee your GP if you have a minor foot injury that doesn&#8217;t start to heal within a few days.\nIf you have type 2 diabetes, you should be invited to have your eyes screened once a year to check for diabetic retinopathy.\nDiabetic retinopathy is an eye condition where the small blood vessels in your eye become damaged.\nIt can occur if your blood glucose level is too high for a long period of time (hyperglycaemia). Left untreated, retinopathy can eventually lead to sight loss.\nRead more about diabetic eye screening\nPeople with diabetes should also see their optician every two years for a regular eye test. Diabetic eye screening is specifically for diabetic retinopathy and can&#8217;t be relied upon for other conditions.\nIf you have diabetes and you&#8217;re thinking about having a baby, it&#8217;s a good idea to discuss this with your diabetes care team.\nIf you&#8217;re taking oral medications to manage your diabetes, this may need to change before you are pregnant. It&#8217;s important that you plan your pregnancy and discuss it with your diabetes team.\nPlanning your pregnancy means you can ensure your blood glucose levels are as well controlled as they can be before you get pregnant.\nYou&#8217;ll need to tightly control your blood glucose level – particularly before becoming pregnant and during the first eight weeks of your baby&#8217;s development – to reduce the risk of birth defects.\nYou should also:\n- check your medications – some tablets used to treat type 2 diabetes may harm your baby, so you may have to switch to insulin injections, stop statin medication or some blood pressure medications\n- take a higher dose of folic acid tablets – folic acid helps prevent your baby developing spinal cord problems, and it&#8217;s recommended all women planning to have a baby take folic acid; women with diabetes are advised to take 5mg each day (only available on prescription) along with pregnancy multivitamins that include vitamin D\n- have your eyes checked – retinopathy, which affects the blood vessels in the eyes, is a risk for all people with diabetes; as pregnancy can place extra pressure on the small vessels in your eyes, it&#8217;s important to treat retinopathy before you become pregnant\nYour GP or diabetes care team can give you further advice.\nYou&#8217;ll be best equipped to manage your diabetes day-to-day if you&#8217;re given information and education when you&#8217;re diagnosed and on an ongoing basis.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that all people who have diabetes should be offered a structured patient education programme, providing information and education to help them care for themselves.\nStructured patient education means there&#8217;s a planned course that:\n- covers all aspects of diabetes\n- is flexible in content\n- is relevant to a person&#8217;s clinical and psychological needs\n- is adaptable to a person&#8217;s educational and cultural background\nFor type 2 diabetes, there are several local adult education programmes, many of which are working towards the criteria for structured education.\nAsk your diabetes care team about the adult education programmes they provide.\nMany people find it helpful to talk to others in a similar position, and you may find support from a group for people with diabetes.\nPatient organisations have local groups where you can meet others diagnosed with the condition. To find your local diabetes support group, visit Diabetes UK.\nIf you want to get in touch with a trained counsellor directly, you can call the Diabetes UK Helpline on 0345 123 2399 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 7pm) or email helpline@diabetes.org.uk\nSome people with diabetes may be eligible for disability and incapacity benefits, depending on the impact the condition has on their lives.\nThe main groups likely to qualify for welfare benefits are children, the elderly, and those with learning disabilities, mental health difficulties or diabetes complications.\nPeople over the age of 65 who are severely disabled may qualify for a type of disability benefit called Attendance Allowance.\nCarers may also be entitled to some benefits, depending on their involvement in caring for the person with diabetes.\nCitizens Advice Scotland can check whether you&#8217;re getting all the benefits you&#8217;re entitled to. Your diabetes specialist nurse and Citizens Advice can also provide advice about filling in the forms.\nIt&#8217;s a common myth that people with diabetes aren&#8217;t allowed to drive anymore. Although there are some restrictions on drivers with diabetes, it&#8217;s not as severe as you may think.\nYou should always tell your insurer that you have diabetes as this may affect your insurance claim. Only individuals who use insulin have to tell the DVLA that they have diabetes. A high majority of individuals who use insulin can carry on driving on a restricted licence. This usually has to be renewed every 3 years.\nAdditional restictions may apply for different licences (e.g Group 2 HGV) so always refer to the DVLA guidelines.\nUnfortunately, some individuals do lose their driving license, most commonly due to experiencing severe hypos.\nIf you start to have a hypo whilst driving you should:\n- Pull over safely\n- Switch off your car engine\n- Take fast-acting carbs, like glucose tablets or sweets, and some longer-acting carbohydrates too, like plain biscuits or crackers\n- Don’t drive until 45 minutes after your blood sugar level has gone back to 5mmol/l or above\nFor more information about driving with diabetes, visit Diabetes UK.\nIf you need to take insulin to control your diabetes, you should have received instructions about looking after yourself when you&#8217;re ill – known as your &#8220;sick day rules&#8221;.\nContact your diabetes care team or GP for advice if you haven&#8217;t received these.\nThe advice you&#8217;re given will be specific to you, but some general measures that your sick day rules may include could be to:\n- keep taking your insulin – it&#8217;s very important not to stop treatment when you&#8217;re ill; your treatment plan may state whether you need to temporarily increase your dose\n- test your blood glucose level more often than usual – most people are advised to check the level at least four times a day\n- keep yourself well hydrated – make sure you drink plenty of sugar-free drinks\n- keep eating – eat solid food if you feel well enough to, or liquid carbohydrates such as milk, soup and yoghurt if this is easier\n- check your ketone levels if your blood glucose level is high\nSeek advice from your diabetes care team or GP if your blood glucose or ketone level remains high after taking insulin, if:\n- you&#8217;re not sure whether to make any changes to your treatment\n- you develop symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis\n- you have any other concerns\nVisit the Telecare Self-Check online tool to find the right support for you in your area.&nbsp;This easy to use online tool allows you to find helpful information on telecare services that could help you live independently at home for longer.\n"

        "disease": "Ulcerative colitis",
        "description": "Ulcerative colitis is a long-term condition where your large bowel (colon and rectum) gets swollen and inflamed.\nYour colon is your large intestine (bowel). Your rectum is the end of your bowel, where poo is stored.\nIf you have ulcerative colitis, you get swelling, inflammation and ulcers in the lining of your large bowel. They can bleed and produce pus.\nUlcerative colitis can affect people of all ages, but it’s usually diagnosed between the age of 15 and 40.\nThe main symptoms of ulcerative colitis are:\n- recurring&nbsp;diarrhoea, which may contain blood, mucus or pus\n- abdominal pain\n- needing to poo often\nYou may also experience:\n- extreme tiredness (fatigue)\n- loss of appetite\n- weight loss\nSome people also get symptoms in other parts of their body. For example, some people develop:\n- painful and swollen joints (arthritis)\n- mouth ulcers\n- areas of painful, red and swollen skin\n- irritated and red eyes\nSome people may go for weeks or months with very mild symptoms, or none at all. This is known as remission. This may be followed by periods where the symptoms are particularly troublesome. These are known as flare-ups or relapses.\nSymptoms of flare-ups vary from person-to-person. They may include:\n- diarrhoea 6 or more times a day\n- blood or mucus in your poo\n- severe abdominal pain\n- symptoms in other parts of your body\nSevere ulcerative colitis can also cause symptoms like:\n- shortness of breath\n- a fast or irregular heartbeat\n- a high temperature (fever)\n- blood in your poo becoming more obvious\nThe exact cause of ulcerative colitis is unknown.\nA combination of factors may be responsible, including:\n- problems with your immune system – where the immune system mistakenly attacks the lining of your large bowel, making it inflamed\n- genetics – genes you inherit from your family\n- environmental factors – like air pollution, medication and viruses or bacteria in your gut\nTo help diagnose ulcerative colitis, your GP will ask about your:\n- your pattern of symptoms\n- your diet\n- any recent travel – for example, you may have developed travellers&#8217; diarrhoea\n- whether you&#8217;re taking any medication, including any over-the-counter medicines\n- whether anyone else in your family has a bowel condition\n- any health problems you’ve had in the past\nYour GP may also:\n- examine your abdomen (tummy)\n- ask for a stool (poo) sample and use a qFIT test to check for blood and mucus, infection or inflammation via a faecal calprotectin test\n- arrange&nbsp;blood tests&nbsp;to check for inflammation or&nbsp;anaemia\nIf your GP thinks that you have ulcerative colitis you may be referred to hospital for more tests. These could include:\n- colonoscopy&nbsp;– a thin, flexible tube with a camera is put into your bottom to look at the whole of your large bowel\n- sigmoidoscopy – a thin, flexible tube with a camera is put into your bottom to look at the end of your large bowel\n- X-ray\n- MRI scan&nbsp;or&nbsp;computerised tomography (CT)\nYou will be told what tests you need and what you need to do to prepare for them.\nTreatment for ulcerative colitis aims to relieve and prevent symptoms.\nYour treatment will depend on how severe your symptoms are and how often they flare up. Mild flare-ups can be usually be treated at home. But severe flare-ups usually need treatment in hospital to reduce the risk of complications.\nTreatment will usually be provided by a range of healthcare professionals.\nMost people will get medication to treat symptoms of ulcerative colitis. This includes medications like:\n- aminosalicylates (ASAs) – often the first treatment option, used to get and keep inflammation under control and can be given rectally as well as orally\n- corticosteroids&nbsp;– used to get inflammation under control quickly, but not suitable for long-term use\nIf you have lots of flare-ups or aminosalicylates do not keep your inflammation under control, you may need other treatments, such as:\n- immunosuppressants like azathioprine or mercaptopurine – used to reduce the activity of the immune system\n- biologic medicines, like adalimumab, infliximab, golimumab, ustekinumab or vedolizumab\n- other advanced medicines like filgotinib, ozanimod, tofacitinib and upadacitinib\nSurgery to treat ulcerative colitis may be an option if:\n- you choose to have surgery instead of taking medications that may cause side effects\n- medications don&#8217;t control your symptoms\n- your quality of life is severely affected by your condition\n- you have serious complications of ulcerative colitis\nSurgery for ulcerative colitis involves removing part or all of your large bowel (known as a colectomy). This means the small intestine must be used to pass waste products out of your body instead.\nDuring the surgery, your small intestine will either be:\n- joined to the surface of your tummy (known as an&nbsp;ileostomy&nbsp;or a colostomy) – after this type of surgery, poo comes out of the opening on your tummy and is collected in special bags that you wear\n- joined directly to your rectum (the end of your large bowel), so your poo comes out of your bottom as usual\n- used to create an internal pouch that&#8217;s connected to your bottom (known as an ileo-anal pouch or J-pouch) – this means your poo can pass through your bottom as usual\nThere’s no evidence that a particular diet causes ulcerative colitis. But alongside medications, some changes to your diet may help control symptoms for some people.\nYou could:\n- eat 5 to 6 small meals rather than 3 main meals\n- try to eat a healthy, varied diet that includes a wide variety of fruit, vegetables, nuts, seeds, proteins and wholegrains\n- drink plenty of water\nYou could also speak to your IBD team about:\n- keeping a food diary to find out if any particular foods affect your symptoms\n- removing trigger foods from your diet – but do not make major changes to your diet without talking to your IBD team and make sure you are still getting all the nutrients you need\n- taking a food supplement if you are struggling to get enough nutrients from your diet\n- being referred to a dietitian\nStress doesn&#8217;t cause ulcerative colitis. But, managing stress may reduce how often you get symptoms.\nTo help manage stress, you could:\n- exercise&nbsp;– speak to your IBD team about a suitable exercise plan\n- try relaxation techniques like yoga, medication and breathing exercises\n- talk to others – Crohn&#8217;s &amp; Colitis UK has details of&nbsp;local support groups\n- speak to your GP if you think you may have&nbsp;depression\nA woman&#8217;s chance of becoming pregnant isn&#8217;t usually affected by ulcerative colitis.\nHowever, surgery for ulcerative colitis might affect your fertility, especially pouch surgery.\nMost women with ulcerative colitis will have a normal pregnancy and a healthy baby. But if you&#8217;re pregnant or planning a pregnancy you should discuss it with your IBD team. This is because they may need to change your medication.\nIf you&#8217;re having a flare-up of ulcerative colitis you may also be advised to avoid getting pregnant until it&#8217;s under control.\nIf you have ulcerative colitis, you may be at an increased risk of developing other problems. This can include:\n- osteoporosis\n- poor growth and development in children and young people\nMore serious and rare complications can include:\n- primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) – inflammation in the bile ducts, which can lead to liver damage\n- narrowing’s in the bowel (strictures) that may become blocked or make it difficult for poo to pass through\n- toxic megacolon – severe inflammation in the colon may lead to trapped gas so the colon becomes very enlarged and can rupture\n- a higher risk of getting&nbsp;bowel cancer\n- a higher risk of getting blood clots in your legs or lungs"

        "description": "An underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) is where your thyroid gland doesn&#8217;t produce enough hormones.\nCommon signs of an underactive thyroid are tiredness, weight gain and feeling depressed.\nAn underactive thyroid can often be successfully&nbsp;treated by taking daily hormone tablets to replace the hormones&nbsp;your thyroid isn&#8217;t making.\nThere&#8217;s no way of preventing an underactive thyroid. Most cases are caused either by the immune system attacking the thyroid gland and damaging it,&nbsp;or&nbsp;by damage to the thyroid that occurs during some treatments for an overactive thyroid&nbsp;or&nbsp;thyroid cancer.\nRead more about the causes&nbsp;of an underactive thyroid\nSymptoms of an underactive thyroid&nbsp;are often similar to those of other conditions,&nbsp;and they&nbsp;usually develop slowly, so you may not notice them for years.\nYou should see your GP and ask to be tested for an underactive thyroid if you have&nbsp;symptoms including:\n- tiredness\n- weight gain\n- depression&nbsp;\n- being sensitive to&nbsp;the cold\n- dry skin and hair\n- muscle aches\nThe only accurate way of finding out whether you have a thyroid problem is to have&nbsp;a&nbsp;thyroid function test, where a sample of blood is tested to measure your&nbsp;hormone levels.\nRead&nbsp;more about testing for an underactive thyroid\nBoth men and women can have an underactive thyroid, although&nbsp;it&#8217;s more common&nbsp;in women. In the UK, it affects 15 in every 1,000 women and&nbsp;1 in 1,000 men. Children can also develop an underactive thyroid.\nAround 1 in 3,500 to 4,000 babies&nbsp;are born with an&nbsp;underactive thyroid (congenital hypothyroidism).&nbsp;All babies born in the UK are screened for congenital hypothyroidism&nbsp;using a&nbsp;blood spot test when the baby is about 5 days old.\nTreatment for an underactive thyroid involves taking daily&nbsp;hormone replacement tablets, called levothyroxine,&nbsp;to raise your&nbsp;thyroxine levels. You&#8217;ll usually need treatment for the rest of your life. However, with proper treatment, you should be able to lead a normal, healthy life.\nIf an underactive thyroid isn&#8217;t treated, it can lead to complications, including heart disease, goitre, pregnancy problems and a life-threatening condition called myxoedema coma (although this is very rare).\nRead more about treating an underactive thyroid&nbsp;and the complications of an underactive thyroid\nMany symptoms of an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) are the same as those of other conditions, so it can easily be confused for something else.\nSymptoms&nbsp;usually develop slowly and you may not realise you have a medical problem for several years.\nCommon symptoms include:\n- tiredness\n- being sensitive to cold\n- weight gain\n- constipation\n- depression\n- slow movements and thoughts\n- muscle aches and weakness\n- muscle cramps\n- dry and scaly skin\n- brittle hair and nails\n- loss of libido (sex drive)\n- pain, numbness and a tingling sensation in the hand and fingers (carpal tunnel syndrome)\n- irregular periods&nbsp;or heavy periods\nElderly people with an underactive thyroid may develop memory problems and depression. Children may experience slower growth and development. Teenagers may start&nbsp;puberty earlier than normal.\nIf you have any of these symptoms, see your GP and ask to be tested for an underactive thyroid.\nRead more about getting tested for an underactive thyroid\nIt&#8217;s unlikely that you&#8217;d have many of the later symptoms of an underactive thyroid, because the condition is often identified before more serious symptoms appear.\nLater symptoms of an underactive thyroid&nbsp;include:\n- a low-pitched and hoarse voice\n- a puffy-looking face\n- thinned or partly missing eyebrows\n- a slow heart rate\n- hearing loss\n- anaemia\nAn underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) is when your thyroid gland doesn&#8217;t produce enough of the hormone thyroxine (also called T4).\nMost cases of an underactive thyroid are caused by the immune system attacking the thyroid gland and damaging it, or by damage that occurs as a result of&nbsp;treatments for&nbsp;thyroid cancer or an overactive thyroid.\nAn underactive thyroid often occurs when the immune system, which usually fights infection, attacks the thyroid gland. This damages the thyroid, which means it&#8217;s not able to make enough of the hormone thyroxine,&nbsp;leading to the symptoms of an underactive thyroid.\nA condition called Hashimoto&#8217;s disease is the most common type of autoimmune reaction&nbsp;that&nbsp;causes an underactive thyroid.\nIt&#8217;s not clear what causes Hashimoto’s disease, but it runs in families. It&#8217;s also common in people with another immune system disorder, such as type 1 diabetes and vitiligo.\nAn underactive thyroid can also occur as a side effect or complication of previous treatment to the thyroid gland, such as surgery or a treatment called radioactive iodine therapy.\nThese treatments are sometimes used for an overactive thyroid&nbsp;(where the thyroid gland&nbsp;produces too much hormone) or thyroid cancer.\nWorldwide,&nbsp;a&nbsp;lack of dietary&nbsp;iodine is a common cause of an underactive thyroid, because the body needs iodine to make thyroxine. However, iodine deficiency is&nbsp;uncommon in the UK.\nBabies are sometimes born with an underactive thyroid because the thyroid gland doesn&#8217;t develop properly in the womb. This is called congenital hypothyroidism and is&nbsp;uncommon, affecting around 1 in 3,000 babies. It&#8217;s&nbsp;usually picked up during routine screening soon after birth.\nA problem with the pituitary gland could lead to an underactive thyroid.&nbsp;The pituitary gland sits at the base of the brain and&nbsp;regulates the thyroid. Therefore, damage to the pituitary gland may lead to an underactive thyroid.\nAn underactive thyroid has also been linked to&nbsp;some viral infections or some&nbsp;medications used to treat other conditions, such as:\n- lithium – a medication sometimes used to treat certain mental health conditions, including depression&nbsp;and&nbsp;bipolar disorder\n- amiodarone – a medication sometimes used to treat irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias)\n- interferons – a class of medication sometimes used to treat certain types of&nbsp;cancer and hepatitis C\nSpeak to your GP or specialist if you&#8217;re concerned that a medication you&#8217;re taking may be affecting your thyroid hormone levels.\nIt&#8217;s very important that an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) is diagnosed as soon as possible.\nLow levels of thyroid-producing hormones, such as&nbsp;triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), can change the way the body processes fat.\nThis can cause high cholesterol and atherosclerosis (clogging of the arteries), which can potentially lead to serious heart-related problems, such as angina and heart attack.\nTherefore, you should see your GP and ask for a&nbsp;blood test&nbsp;if you repeatedly have symptoms of an underactive thyroid.\nA&nbsp;blood test measuring your hormone levels is the only accurate way to find out whether&nbsp;there&#8217;s a problem.\nThe test, called a thyroid function test, looks at levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine (T4) in the blood.\nA&nbsp;high level of TSH and a low level of&nbsp;T4 in the blood&nbsp;could mean you have&nbsp;an underactive thyroid.\nIf your test results show raised TSH but normal&nbsp;T4, you may be at risk of developing an underactive thyroid in the future.\nYour GP may recommend that you have a repeat blood test every so often to see whether you eventually develop an underactive thyroid.\nBlood tests are also sometimes used for other measurements, such as checking the level of a hormone called&nbsp;triiodothyronine (T3). However, this isn&#8217;t routine, because T3 levels can often remain normal, even if you have a significantly underactive thyroid.\nThe Lab Tests Online UK website has more information about the different types of thyroid function tests.\nYour GP may refer you to an endocrinologist (a specialist in hormone disorders) if you:\n- are younger than 16\n- are pregnant or trying to get pregnant\n- have just given birth\n- have another health condition, such as heart disease, which may complicate your medication\n- are taking a medication known to cause a reduction in thyroid hormones, such as amiodarone or lithium\nAn underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) is usually treated by taking daily hormone replacement tablets called levothyroxine.\nLevothyroxine&nbsp;replaces the thyroxine hormone, which your thyroid doesn&#8217;t make enough of.\nYou&#8217;ll initially have regular&nbsp;blood tests until the correct dose&nbsp;of levothyroxine is reached. This&nbsp;can take a little while to get right.\nYou may start on a low dose of levothyroxine, which may be increased gradually, depending on how your body responds.&nbsp;Some people start to feel better&nbsp;soon after beginning treatment,&nbsp;while others&nbsp;don&#8217;t notice an improvement in their symptoms for several months\nOnce you&#8217;re taking the correct dose, you&#8217;ll usually have a blood test once a year to monitor your hormone levels.\nIf&nbsp;blood tests suggest you may have an underactive thyroid, but you don&#8217;t have any symptoms or they&#8217;re very mild, you may not need any treatment. In these cases, your GP will usually monitor your hormone levels every few months and prescribe levothyroxine if you develop symptoms.\nIf you&#8217;re prescribed levothyroxine, you should take 1 tablet at the same time every day.&nbsp;It&#8217;s usually recommended that you take the tablets in the morning, although some people prefer to take them at night.\nThe effectiveness of the&nbsp;tablets can be altered by other medications, supplements or foods, so they should be swallowed with water on an empty stomach, and you should avoid eating for 30 minutes afterwards.\nIf you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember, if this is within a few hours of your usual time. If you don&#8217;t remember until later than this, skip the dose and take the next dose at the usual time, unless&nbsp;advised otherwise by your doctor.\nAn underactive thyroid is a lifelong condition, so you&#8217;ll usually need to take levothyroxine for the rest of your life.\nLevothyroxine doesn&#8217;t usually have any side effects, because the tablets simply replace a missing hormone.\nSide effects usually only occur if you&#8217;re taking too much levothyroxine. This can cause problems including sweating, chest pain, headaches, diarrhoea and vomiting.\nTell your doctor if you develop new symptoms while taking levothyroxine. You should also let them know if your symptoms get worse or don&#8217;t improve.\nIn the UK, combination therapy – using levothyroxine and triiodothyronine (T3) together – isn&#8217;t routinely used because there&#8217;s insufficient evidence to show it’s better than using levothyroxine alone (monotherapy).\nIn most cases, suppressing thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) using high dose thyroid replacement therapy should be avoided because it carries a risk of causing adverse side effects, such as atrial fibrillation (an irregular and abnormally fast heart rate), strokes, osteoporosis and fracture.\nHowever, this type of treatment may sometimes be recommended in cases where a person has a history of&nbsp;thyroid cancer and there’s a significant risk of it reoccurring.\nSeveral complications can occur if you have an underactive thyroid that isn&#8217;t treated.\nIf you have an untreated underactive thyroid, your risk of developing cardiovascular disease is increased.\nThis is because having low levels of the hormone thyroxine can lead to increased levels of cholesterol in your blood. High cholesterol can cause fatty deposits to build up in your arteries, restricting the flow of blood.\nContact your doctor if you&#8217;re being treated for an underactive thyroid and you develop chest pain, so that any problems can be detected and treated, if necessary.\nA&nbsp;goitre&nbsp;is an abnormal swelling of the thyroid gland that causes a lump to form in the throat. Goitres can develop in people with an underactive thyroid&nbsp;when the body tries to&nbsp;stimulate the thyroid to produce more thyroid hormones.\nIf an underactive thyroid isn&#8217;t treated during pregnancy, there&#8217;s a risk of problems occurring. These&nbsp;include:\n- pre-eclampsia – which can cause high blood pressure and fluid retention in the mother and growth problems in the baby\n- anaemia&nbsp;in the mother\n- an underactive thyroid in the baby\n- birth defects\n- bleeding after birth\n- problems with the baby&#8217;s physical and mental development\n- premature birth or a low birthweight\n- stillbirth or miscarriage\nThese problems can usually be avoided with treatment under the guidance of a specialist in hormone disorders (an endocrinologist). Therefore, tell your GP if you have an underactive thyroid and you&#8217;re pregnant or trying to get pregnant.\nIn very rare cases, a severe underactive thyroid may lead to a life-threatening condition called myxoedema coma. This is where the thyroid hormone levels become very low, causing symptoms such as confusion, hypothermia&nbsp;and drowsiness.\nMyxoedema coma requires emergency treatment in hospital. It&#8217;s usually treated with thyroid hormone replacement medication given directly into a vein. In some cases, other treatments such as breathing support, antibiotics and steroid medication (corticosteroids) are also required."

These include:\n- treating the underlying cause, if urinary incontinence is caused by another condition\n- lifestyle changes – such as reducing your caffeine intake, changing how much you drink, and maintaining a healthy weight\n- pelvic floor muscle training – your healthcare professional will explain how to do these exercises\n- bladder training – techniques to increase the length of time between feeling the need to go to the toilet and peeing\nIncontinence products (like pads or pants) aren’t a treatment for urinary incontinence. But you might find them helpful while you are waiting for assessment or for a treatment to start working.\nIf these treatments don’t work for you, your doctor may suggest trying other treatments, like medication or surgery.

Short-term antibiotics do not work and urine tests do not show an infection.\nThis might mean you have a chronic (long-term) UTI. This can be caused by bacteria entering the lining of the bladder.\nBecause urine tests do not always pick up the infection and the symptoms can be similar to other conditions, chronic UTIs can be hard to diagnose.\nChronic UTIs might be treated with antibiotics that you take for a long time.\nChronic UTIs can have a big impact on your quality of life. If you have been treated for a UTI but you still have symptoms, speak to your GP about chronic UTIs and ask to be referred to a specialist.\nUTIs are normally treated with a short term course of antibiotics.\nMost women are given a 3-day course of antibiotic capsules or tablets. Men, pregnant women and people with more serious symptoms may need a slightly longer course.&nbsp;\nYour symptoms will normally pass within 3 to 5 days of starting treatment. Make sure you complete the whole course of antibiotics that you&#8217;ve been prescribed, even if you&#8217;re feeling better.&nbsp;\nOver-the-counter pain relief such as paracetamol&nbsp;can help with any pain.

This includes:\n- bleeding between your normal&nbsp;periods, or after sex\n- bleeding after the menopause (post-menopausal bleeding)\nOther symptoms can include:\n- smelly or bloody vaginal discharge\n- pain during sex\n- pain when urinating\n- needing to urinate more frequently than usual\n- blood in your urine\n- pelvic pain\n- an itch or lump in your vagina\nSpeak to your GP if you experience any abnormal vaginal bleeding, changes in your usual pattern of periods (such as irregular periods or heavier periods than usual), or problems urinating.\nWhile it&#8217;s highly unlikely that these symptoms are caused by vaginal cancer, they should still be investigated by your GP.\nRead more about diagnosing vaginal cancer.\nThe exact causes of vaginal cancer are unknown, but things that may increase your risk of developing it include:\n- being infected with a particularly persistent type of the human papilloma virus (HPV), which can be spread during sex\n- your age – 7&nbsp;out of every 10 cases of vaginal cancer affect women and anyone with a vagina over 60\n- a previous history of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) – abnormal cells in the vagina or cervix that can sometimes become cancerous\nAs there is a possible link with HPV, it may be possible to reduce your risk of vaginal cancer by practising safe sex.&nbsp;\nThe&nbsp;HPV vaccination,&nbsp;which is routinely offered to girls who are 12 to 13 years old, provides protection against 2&nbsp;strains of HPV thought to be responsible for most cases of vaginal and cervical cancer.\nRead more about the causes of vaginal cancer.\nTreatment for vaginal cancer depends on which part of your vagina is affected and how far the cancer has spread (known as the &#8216;stage&#8217;).\nThe main treatments for vaginal cancer are:\n- radiotherapy – radiation is used to destroy the cancerous cells\n- surgery to remove the cancerous cells\n- chemotherapy – medication is used to kill the cancerous cells; this is often used in combination with radiotherapy\nThese treatments can cause both short- and long-term side effects that should be discussed with your care team before treatment begins.\nRead more about treating vaginal cancer\nCancer occurs when the cells in a certain area of your body divide and multiply too rapidly. This produces a lump of tissue known as a tumour.\nThe exact&nbsp;reason why this happens in cases&nbsp;of vaginal cancer is unknown, but certain things can&nbsp;increase your chances of developing the condition.\nHuman papilloma virus (HPV) is the name given to a&nbsp;group of viruses that affect the skin and the moist membranes that line the body, such as those in the cervix, anus, mouth and throat. HPV is spread during sex, including anal and oral sex.\nThere are many different types of HPV and up to 8&nbsp;out of every 10 people are infected with&nbsp;the&nbsp;virus&nbsp;at some time during their lives. In most cases, the virus goes away without causing any harm and doesn&#8217;t lead to vaginal cancer.\nHowever, HPV is present in&nbsp;more than&nbsp;two-thirds of people with vaginal cancer, which suggests that it may increase your risk of developing the condition.&nbsp;\nHPV is known to cause changes in the cells of the cervix, which can lead to cervical cancer. It&#8217;s thought that the virus could have a similar effect on the cells of the vagina.\nYou&#8217;re more likely to develop vaginal cancer if you&#8217;ve previously been found to have abnormal cells in your:\n- cervix&nbsp;– known as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)\n- vagina&nbsp;– known as&nbsp;vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN)\nCIN and VAIN are terms used to describe cells that are abnormal, but not different enough to be considered cancerous. Both are thought to be closely linked to having a persistent HPV infection.\nThe&nbsp;abnormal cells&nbsp;don&#8217;t&nbsp;usually cause any problems themselves and&nbsp;may only be detected during cervical screening, but left untreated there is a small chance they could eventually become cancerous.\nIf you&#8217;re found to have CIN or VAIN, a procedure to remove or destroy the abnormal cells may be recommended.\nA medicine called diethylstilbestrol is known to increase your risk of vaginal cancer. The medication&nbsp;was widely prescribed during pregnancy between 1938&nbsp;and 1971, because it was thought it&nbsp;could help reduce the risk of miscarriage.\nHowever, in 1971, researchers discovered a link between diethylstilbestrol and cancer in the children of women given the medicine.&nbsp;The use of diethylstilbestrol during pregnant was then banned.\nThe risk of vaginal cancer associated with&nbsp;diethylstilbestrol is small and as it&#8217;s now&nbsp;over 40 years since it was last&nbsp;used during pregnancies, cases of vaginal cancer linked to the medication are very rare.\nOther things that may increase your risk of vaginal cancer include:\n- your age – 7&nbsp;out of every 10 cases of vaginal cancer occur in women and anyone with a vagina over 60\n- having a history of reproductive cancers, such as&nbsp;cervical cancer or&nbsp;vulval cancer&nbsp;– particularly if you were treated&nbsp;with&nbsp;radiotherapy\n- smoking\n- having HIV\nRead further information:\n- Cancer Research UK: Risks and causes of vaginal cancer\nTo help diagnose vaginal cancer, your GP will ask you about your symptoms and may carry out a physical examination.\nThey may also refer you for&nbsp;blood tests to rule out other causes of your symptoms, such as infection.\nIf your GP cannot find an obvious cause of your symptoms, they will probably refer you to a gynaecologist for further testing. A gynaecologist is a specialist in treating conditions of the female reproductive system.\nIf your GP refers you urgently because they think you have cancer, you have the right to be seen by a specialist within 2&nbsp;weeks.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that GPs consider referring a woman who has an unexplained mass in or at the entrance to their vagina.\nIf you are referred to a gynaecologist, you may have:\n- external and internal vaginal examinations to look for any unusual lumps or swellings\n- a&nbsp;colposcopy&nbsp;–&nbsp;an examination where a special instrument (colposcope) that acts like a magnifying glass is used to study your vagina in greater detail\nIf your&nbsp;gynaecologist thinks there may be abnormal tissue inside your vagina, a small sample of the tissue will be removed and checked under a microscope for cancerous cells. This is known as a biopsy.\nIf the results of the biopsy suggest you have cancer, you&nbsp;may have further tests to see if the cancer has spread.\nThese tests may include a more&nbsp;detailed internal vaginal examination carried out under&nbsp;general anaesthetic, X-rays, computerised tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.\nHealthcare professionals use a staging system to describe how far vaginal cancer has advanced.\n- stage 1&nbsp;– the cancer has started to grow into the wall of the vagina\n- stage 2&nbsp;– the cancer has begun to spread outside the vagina into the surrounding tissues\n- stage 3&nbsp;– the cancer has spread into your pelvis and may have spread to nearby lymph nodes\n- stage 4a&nbsp;– the cancer has spread beyond your vagina and into organs such as your bladder or back passage (rectum)\n- stage 4b&nbsp;– the cancer has spread into organs further away, such as the lungs\nThe stage of your cancer is important in determining which treatment is most appropriate and whether a cure is possible. Generally, the lower the stage when cancer is diagnosed, the better the chance of a cure.\nIf a cure is not possible, treatment can still help&nbsp;relieve&nbsp;any symptoms and slow down the spread of the cancer. Read more about how vaginal cancer is treated.\nRead further information:\n- Cancer Research UK: Tests for vaginal cancer\n- Cancer Research UK: Stages and grades for vaginal cancer\nTreatment for vaginal cancer will depend on where the cancer is in your vagina and how far it has spread. Possible treatments include radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy.\nWhen you are diagnosed with cancer, you will be cared for by a group of different healthcare professionals, known as a multidisciplinary team (MDT).\nYour MDT will include a range of specialists, including surgeons, clinical oncologists (specialists in the non-surgical treatment of cancer), and&nbsp;specialist cancer nurses.\nYour MDT will recommend a treatment plan they feel is most suitable for you, but the final decision will be yours.\nBefore going to hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions to ask the specialist. For example, you may want to find out the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.\nRadiotherapy&nbsp;is the main treatment for vaginal cancer. It can be used:\n- as an initial treatment to cure the cancer\n- in combination with chemotherapy (chemoradiation)\n- after surgery to prevent the cancer from returning\n- to control symptoms when a cure is not possible (palliative radiotherapy)\nThere are 2&nbsp;main ways that radiotherapy for vaginal cancer can be given:\n- external radiotherapy –&nbsp;a machine beams high-energy rays at your vagina and pelvis\n- internal radiotherapy – a small radioactive device, which looks like a tampon, is inserted into your vagina\nThe type of radiotherapy you receive depends on where the cancer is in your body. For example, internal radiotherapy may be used if the cancer is in the lining of your vagina, and external radiotherapy may be used if the cancer is deeper in the tissues of the vagina. You can&nbsp;receive a combination of internal and external radiotherapy.\nExternal radiotherapy is usually given for around 4&nbsp;to 6&nbsp;weeks in short daily sessions, from Monday to Friday. You return home between treatments and have a break&nbsp;at the weekends.\nInternal radiotherapy may involve either a long treatment session where you need to stay in hospital for 24 hours, or several short day-case treatments.\nRead more about how radiotherapy is performed.\nFollowing radiotherapy, it&#8217;s likely you will have some side effects. These occur because radiotherapy temporarily damages some healthy cells as well as destroying cancerous ones.\nPossible side effects of radiotherapy for vaginal cancer include:\n- sore, red skin&nbsp;– similar to&nbsp;sunburn\n- vaginal discharge\n- pain while passing urine\n- diarrhoea\n- tiredness\n- feeling sick&nbsp;\n- narrowing of the vagina (see below)\n- early menopause and infertility (see below)\nRead more about the side effects of radiotherapy.\nRadiotherapy may cause you to lose interest in sex, particularly if you have side effects such as tiredness or nausea, or you are anxious about your condition or treatment.\nRadiotherapy can also cause scar tissue to form in your vagina, which can make it narrower and means having sex is difficult or uncomfortable.\nIf you feel up to it, your care team may suggest having sex regularly during treatment to help stop this happening. Devices called dilators, which are inserted into the vagina, can also be used after treatment stops to help&nbsp;stop your vagina getting narrower.\nYou may also experience some&nbsp;vaginal dryness or pain when having sex. If this happens, you can try using lubricants or asking your&nbsp;care team about&nbsp;possible treatments.\nIf you have external radiotherapy to your pelvis, you may experience an early&nbsp;menopause (if you have not had the menopause already).\nThis means you will no longer be able to have children (infertility). Before your treatment, your&nbsp;care team will explain whether this is a risk and discuss the options and support&nbsp;available.\nThere are 4&nbsp;main types of surgery used to treat vaginal cancer:\n- partial vaginectomy – removing the upper section of your vagina\n- radical vaginectomy –&nbsp;removing all of your vagina and pelvic lymph nodes\n- radical vaginectomy and radical hysterectomy –&nbsp;removing all of your vagina, womb, ovaries, fallopian tubes and pelvic lymph nodes\n- pelvic exenteration – removing all of your vagina and surrounding tissue, including the bladder and/or rectum (back passage)\nA partial vaginectomy can be used to treat&nbsp;stage 1&nbsp;vaginal cancer, when radiotherapy has failed to remove the cancer or where a woman prefers to have surgery rather than radiotherapy because she still wants to have children.\nYour surgeon will remove the cancerous section of the vagina, as well as&nbsp;some surrounding healthy tissue, just in case a small number of cancerous cells have spread.\nYour surgeon will repair the defect in the vaginal wall, which means you will be able to have sex after you have recovered from the operation.\nA radical vaginectomy&nbsp;may be&nbsp;used to treat cases of advanced stage 1 and stage 2 vaginal cancer. The surgeon will remove most, or all, of your vagina.\nA plastic surgeon may be able to make a new vagina using skin, muscle and tissue taken from another part of your body – usually one of your thighs or buttocks.\nYou will still be able to have sex after a vaginal reconstruction, although you will need to use lubricant, because&nbsp;the lining of the new vagina cannot make the mucus it would naturally make.\nA radical hysterectomy is often&nbsp;performed at the same time as a radical vaginectomy.\nDuring a radical hysterectomy, all of the reproductive system is removed, including the womb, fallopian tubes, ovaries and nearby lymph nodes.\nPelvic exenteration is used in a few cases to treat recurrent or advanced cases of vaginal cancer.\nIf&nbsp;you no longer have a bladder, you will need another way to pass urine. One solution is for your surgeon to make a hole (stoma) in your tummy. A bag is then attached to the stoma so that urine can be passed into it. The bag is known as a urostomy bag.\nSimilarly, as you&nbsp;may no longer have a rectum, you will need a way to pass stools (faeces) out of your digestive system. Another stoma can be made and attached to a collection bag, known as a colostomy bag.\nRead more about colostomies.\nA vaginal reconstruction can be carried out after&nbsp;a pelvic exenteration. It&nbsp;may also be possible to reconstruct your rectum and attach it to the remaining section of your bowel once this has healed. In this case, you will only need a temporary colostomy.\nAs pelvic exenteration is major surgery, it may take you several months to fully recover from the operation.\nChemotherapy&nbsp;is usually used in combination with radiotherapy or to control symptoms when a cure is not possible (palliative chemotherapy). It&#8217;s usually given by injection (intravenous chemotherapy).\nLike radiotherapy, the powerful cancer-killing medicines used in chemotherapy can also damage healthy tissue and cause a range of side effects. Side effects of chemotherapy for vaginal cancer can include:\n- tiredness\n- feeling sick\n- increased risk of infections\n- diarrhoea\n- hair loss\nRead more about the side effects of chemotherapy.\nTreatment for vaginal cancer can have a significant emotional impact, particularly for young women who experience an early menopause as a result of treatment.\nThe removal of some or all of the vagina can be traumatic for pre- and post-menopausal women alike, and&nbsp;some women feel less &#8216;womanly&#8217; than they did before. It&#8217;s not uncommon to feel a sense of loss and bereavement after treatment. In some women, this may lead to depression.\nYou may find it helpful to talk to other women who have had similar treatment. Your GP or hospital staff may be able to recommend a suitable local support group. Charities can also help:\n- Macmillan Cancer Support&nbsp;has information&nbsp;on&nbsp;groups you can join and a support line that you can call for free on 0808 808 00 00 (Monday to Friday, 8am to 8pm)\n- Cancer Research UK&nbsp;provides a free phone number that you can call on 0808 800 40 40 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm)\nIf feelings of depression persist,&nbsp;speak to your&nbsp;GP about the treatment and support available.\nAs vaginal cancer is rare, you may be asked to take part in a&nbsp;clinical trial. Clinical trials are an important way for healthcare professionals to learn more about the best way to treat specific conditions.\nMost clinical trials involve comparing a new treatment with an existing treatment to determine whether the new treatment is more or less effective. If you do receive a new treatment, there is no guarantee it will be more effective than an existing one.\nYou can find out whether there are currently any&nbsp;clinical trials for vaginal cancer, or ask your care team if there are clinical trials in your area. Your care team can explain the advantages and disadvantages of taking part.\nRead further information:\n- Cancer Research UK: Treatment for vaginal cancer\n- Macmillan Cancer Support: Vaginal cancer"

        "disease": "Varicose eczema",
        "description": "Varicose eczema is a long-term skin condition that affects the lower legs and is common in people with varicose veins.\nIt&nbsp;is&nbsp;also known as venous eczema, gravitational eczema and&nbsp;stasis eczema.\nLike all types of eczema,&nbsp;the affected skin becomes:\n- itchy\n- red and&nbsp;swollen\n- dry and&nbsp;flaky&nbsp;\n- scaly or crusty\nThere may be periods&nbsp;when these symptoms&nbsp;improve and periods when they become more severe.\nYour legs may become swollen, especially towards the end of the day or after long periods of standing. Varicose veins (swollen and enlarged veins) are often visible on the legs.\nSome people also have other symptoms, such as:\n- brown discolouration of the skin\n- red, tender and tight skin that can eventually become hardened (lipodermatosclerosis)\n- small, white scars (atrophie blanche)\n- pain\n- eczema affecting other parts of the body\nLeft untreated,&nbsp;leg ulcers&nbsp;can develop. These are&nbsp;long-lasting wounds that form where the skin has become damaged.\nSee your GP if you have symptoms of varicose eczema. They will&nbsp;often be able to make a diagnosis simply by looking at the skin.\nRead more about diagnosing varicose eczema.\nVaricose eczema is caused by increased pressure in the leg veins.\nWhen the small valves in the veins stop working properly, it&#8217;s difficult for blood to be pushed against gravity and it&nbsp;can leak&nbsp;backwards.\nThis increases the&nbsp;pressure in the veins, which can cause fluid to leak into the surrounding tissue. It is thought that varicose eczema may develop as a result of the immune system reacting to this fluid.\nVaricose eczema is more common in people with varicose veins, as these are also often a sign that the leg veins aren’t working properly.\nRead more about the causes of varicose eczema.\nVaricose eczema tends to be a long-term&nbsp;problem. However, treatments are available to help keep&nbsp;it under control.\nFor most people, treatment involves a combination of:\n- self-help measures – including ways to improve your circulation, such as keeping active and frequently raising your legs\n- emollients – moisturisers applied to the skin to stop it becoming dry)\n- topical corticosteroids – ointments and creams applied to the skin to help treat the eczema and relieve symptoms\n- compression stockings – specially designed stockings, usually worn every day, that steadily squeeze your legs and help to improve your circulation\nIf these treatments don’t help, your GP may refer you to a dermatologist (skin specialist) in case there is another cause for your symptoms or if they are concerned you may also have a type of eczema called contact dermatitis.\nIf you also have varicose veins, you may be referred to a vascular specialist (a doctor or surgeon specialising in conditions affecting the blood vessels) who can talk to you about the treatment options for varicose veins.\nRead&nbsp;more about&nbsp;treating varicose eczema.\nVaricose eczema is usually caused by increased pressure in your leg veins.\nInside your veins there are&nbsp;valves that let the blood through in one direction and prevent it flowing backwards.\nSometimes, the walls of the veins can become stretched and lose their elasticity, causing the valves to become weakened. If the valves do not function properly,&nbsp;blood may leak backwards.\nThis&nbsp;increases the pressure in your veins, which may cause fluid to leak into surrounding tissues. It is thought that varicose eczema may develop as a result of your immune system reacting to these fluids in the tissues under your skin.\nThis increase in pressure can also cause blood to collect in your veins, which become swollen and enlarged (varicose veins).\nIt is not fully understood why the walls of the veins stretch and the valves weaken.&nbsp;Some&nbsp;people develop the condition&nbsp;for no obvious reason, although there are certain&nbsp;factors that increase the chances of this happening, including:\n- gender – varicose eczema is more common in women\n- obesity – this can increase the pressure in your leg veins\n- pregnancy&nbsp;– this can also&nbsp;increase the pressure in your&nbsp;leg veins\n- not being able to move for a long period of time – this can affect the circulation in&nbsp;your leg veins\n- having previously had deep vein thrombosis (DVT) –&nbsp;blood clots that develop in&nbsp;leg veins, which can damage the&nbsp;valves in your veins\n- increasing age – people generally find it harder to move about as they get older, which can affect their circulation\nSee your GP if you have symptoms of varicose eczema. They can usually make a diagnosis by simply looking at the affected areas.\nYour GP will also ask you questions to determine whether you have a problem with the flow of blood in your leg veins, as this is the main cause of varicose eczema.\nTo help make a diagnosis, your GP may want to know if you have a history of:\n- varicose veins&nbsp;– swollen and enlarged veins\n- deep vein thrombosis (DVT) –&nbsp;a blood clot in one of the deep veins of your legs\n- leg ulcers&nbsp;–&nbsp;areas of damaged skin that take several weeks to heal\n- cellulitis&nbsp;– an infection of the deeper layers of the skin and underlying tissue\n- surgery or injury to your legs\nYour GP may also check the pulse in your feet and they may carry out an ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) test to see if compression stockings are suitable for you. See the section on&nbsp;treating varicose eczema for more information about these.\nThe ABPI test involves comparing blood pressure readings taken from your ankles and upper arms. A significant difference in the readings suggests a problem with the flow of blood in your arteries&nbsp;– in which case, compression stockings may not be safe to use.\nYou may be referred to a specialist in a local hospital for further tests. This might be&nbsp;a vascular specialist (a doctor or surgeon&nbsp;specialising in conditions affecting the blood vessels) or a dermatologist (a specialist in skin conditions) if:\n- you have varicose veins and changes to your skin, such as varicose eczema, lipodermatosclerosis (hard, tightened skin) or a history of&nbsp;leg ulcers\n- you have very poor blood flow in the blood vessels in your legs&nbsp;\n- your symptoms don&#8217;t get better, despite treatment&nbsp;\n- it is possible that you may have&nbsp;contact dermatitis\nTreatment for varicose eczema aims to improve the condition of your skin, treat your symptoms and help improve your circulation (blood flow).\nFor many people, this will involve long-term treatment with a combination of:\n- emollients (moisturisers)&nbsp;\n- topical corticosteroids\n- compression stockings\nThere are also some self-help techniques that you can try. These treatment options are described in more detail below.\nLipodermatosclerosis (hardened,&nbsp;tight skin) is treated in a similar way to varicose eczema. If you have a venous leg ulcer, you can also&nbsp;read about treating venous leg ulcers.\nThere are some steps you can take to reduce the symptoms of varicose eczema and help prevent further problems, such as:\n- try to avoid injuring your skin –&nbsp;injuries to your skin could lead to an ulcer&nbsp;developing\n- raise your legs when you are resting –&nbsp;for example, by propping up your feet on some pillows&nbsp;(ideally so that they are above the level of your heart), as this can help reduce swelling&nbsp;\n- keep physically active&nbsp;– this will improve your circulation and&nbsp;help you maintain a healthy weight\nFluid&nbsp;can build up&nbsp;in the lower legs if you sit or stand for too long, so it is important to keep moving. Walking will get your muscles working and help to push the blood through the veins to your heart.\nThe&nbsp;National Eczema Society also recommends regularly flexing your feet and rising up onto your toes or bending down at the knees.\nEmollients are&nbsp;moisturising treatments applied directly to the skin to reduce water loss and cover it with a protective film.&nbsp;They are often used to help manage dry or scaly skin conditions such as eczema.\nA&nbsp;number of different emollients are available. Some can be bought over the counter without a prescription, but if you have varicose eczema it may be helpful to ask your GP&nbsp;to recommend a suitable product.\nYou may need to try several different emollients to find one that works for you. You may also be prescribed a mixture of emollients, for example:\n- an ointment for very dry skin&nbsp;\n- a cream or lotion for less dry skin\n- an emollient to use instead of soap&nbsp;\n- an emollient to add to bath water or use in the shower\nThe difference between lotions, creams and ointments is the amount of oil that&nbsp;they contain. Ointments contain the most oil, so they can be quite greasy, but&nbsp;are the most effective at keeping moisture in the skin. Lotions contain the least amount of&nbsp;oil, so are not greasy, but can be less effective. Creams are somewhere in between.\nIf you have varicose eczema, you should use&nbsp;an emollient at least twice a day, even if you do not have any symptoms.\nTo apply the emollient:\n- use a large amount&nbsp;– you should aim to cover all of the skin on your lower leg, not just the obviously affected areas\n- don&#8217;t rub it in&nbsp;–&nbsp;instead, smooth it into the skin in the same direction that the hair grows\n- apply&nbsp;every 2&nbsp;to 3&nbsp;hours for very dry skin&nbsp;\n- after a bath or shower, gently dry the skin, then immediately apply the emollient while the skin is still moist&nbsp;\n- do not share emollients with other people\nIt is very important to keep using emollients during a flare-up of varicose eczema, because this is when the skin needs the most moisture.&nbsp;Apply emollients frequently and in generous amounts during a flare-up.\nIt’s unusual for emollients to cause side effects, but they can occasionally cause a rash, and greasy emollients may sometimes cause folliculitis (inflammation of the hair follicles). If you experience any side effects from your emollient, speak to your GP, who can prescribe an alternative product.\nEmollients added to bath water can make your bath very slippery, so take care getting in and out of the bath.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nIf your skin is inflamed from a flare-up of varicose eczema, your GP may prescribe a topical corticosteroid (corticosteroid medication that is applied directly to your skin in the form of a cream or ointment) to quickly reduce the inflammation. They are also commonly known as topical steroids.\nDifferent strength topical corticosteroids can be prescribed, depending on the severity of your varicose eczema. If you have flare-ups of lipodermatosclerosis, you may need a very strong topical corticosteroid.\nWhen using corticosteroids, only apply the treatment to the affected areas. Your doctor can advise you&nbsp;on how much to apply and how often. You can also check the advice in the patient information leaflet that comes with your medication.\nMost people only have to apply a topical corticosteroid once a day. When applying the medication, you should:\n- apply your emollient first and wait around 30 minutes before applying the topical corticosteroid (until the emollient has soaked into your skin)\n- apply it only to the affected area\n- use the topical corticosteroid for&nbsp;7 to 14 days and continue to apply the treatment for 48 hours after the flare-up has cleared\nIf your varicose eczema is moderate to severe, you may need to apply topical corticosteroids both between flare-ups and during them.\nIf you need to use topical corticosteroids on a long-term basis, you should apply them less frequently. Your GP will advise you&nbsp;on how often you should be applying them.\nYou should also speak to your GP if you have been using a topical corticosteroid and your symptoms have not improved.\nTopical corticosteroids may cause a mild and short-lived burning or stinging sensation as you apply them, particularly if using a cream.\nGenerally, using a strong topical corticosteroid for prolonged periods will increase your risk of getting more serious side effects, such as thinning of the skin. Your doctor will advise you as to the strength of the medication you require and when you should use it.\nMedical compression stockings are specially designed to steadily squeeze your legs to help improve your circulation. They are tightest at the ankle and get gradually looser as they go further up your leg. This encourages blood to flow upwards towards your heart.\nMedical compression stockings are used to treat varicose eczema and lipodermatosclerosis by improving the flow of blood through your leg veins and reducing the pressure in the veins.\nCompression stockings are available in a variety of different sizes and pressures. They are also available in:\n- different colours\n- different lengths – some come up to the knee and others also cover the thigh (you should only need knee-high stockings for varicose eczema)\n- different foot styles – some cover the whole foot and some stop before the toes\nSupport stockings or tights that lightly compress the legs can be bought from pharmacies. Compression stockings that compress the legs more are available on prescription and will require you to be measured by a nurse first.\nIn some cases, if you find it difficult to put on your stockings, you may be advised to use a tubular bandage instead.\nYou will usually need to put your compression stockings on as soon as you get up in the morning and take them off when you go to bed. Wearing compression stockings can be uncomfortable, particularly during hot weather, but it is important to wear them correctly to get the most benefit from them.\nPull them all the way up so that the correct level of compression is applied to each part of your leg. Do not let the stocking roll down, or it may dig into your skin in a tight band around your leg. Speak to your GP if the stockings are uncomfortable, they do not seem to fit, or you have difficulty putting them on. It may be possible to get custom-made stockings that will fit you exactly.\nTake care when&nbsp;putting compression stockings on and taking them off,&nbsp;as this&nbsp;can damage fragile skin. If you have a leg ulcer, it ideally needs to heal before you start wearing compression stockings.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nCompression stockings usually have to be replaced every 3&nbsp;to 6&nbsp;months. Speak to your GP if your stockings become damaged, as they may no longer be effective.&nbsp;  &nbsp; You should be prescribed 2&nbsp;stockings (or 2&nbsp;sets of stockings if you are wearing 1&nbsp;on each leg) so that 1&nbsp;stocking can be worn while the other is being washed and dried. Compression stockings should be hand-washed in warm water and dried away from direct heat.\nIf you have varicose veins,&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;varicose eczema, treating these may sometimes be helpful.\nIf your GP thinks treatment may be beneficial, they can refer you to a vascular surgeon, who can arrange for an ultrasound scan of your leg to find the faulty blood vessels. Treatment of your varicose veins can then be planned.\nThere are a number of treatments available that can improve the symptoms and appearance of varicose veins, including:\n- endothermal ablation –&nbsp;where energy from either high-frequency radio waves or lasers is used&nbsp;to seal the affected veins\n- sclerotherapy – where a&nbsp;special foam is injected&nbsp;into your veins to seal them\n- ligation and stripping – where affected veins are tied off and surgically removed\nThese procedures are usually performed in the day surgery department of a hospital."

        "disease": "Varicose veins",
        "description": "Varicose veins are swollen and twisted veins that usually occur on the legs. They&#8217;re common and are not usually serious.\nVaricose veins are widened veins that look swollen and twisted under the skin. They may be lumpy or bulge out.\nIt&#8217;s most common for varicose veins to develop in the legs but you can get them on other parts of the body too.\nOther symptoms of varicose veins can include:\n- pain, aching or a feeling of heaviness\n- swollen feet and ankles\n- burning or throbbing in your legs\n- muscle cramp in your legs, particularly at night\n- dry, itchy and thin skin over the affected vein\nThese symptoms are usually worse during warm weather or if you’ve been standing up for long periods of time. They may improve if you rest and raise your legs.\nIf your GP practice is closed, phone 111.\nYou have varicose veins and you:\nMost varicose veins don&#8217;t need to be treated.\nA GP may refer you to a specialist for tests and treatment if you have:\n- symptoms like pain, heaviness, swollen legs, itching or skin changes\n- any complications, like ulcers on your legs\nTreatment to improve how varicose veins look isn&#8217;t usually available on the NHS if they don&#8217;t cause any other problems. You may be able to pay for it privately.\nIf you&#8217;re referred to a specialist they&#8217;ll usually do a test called a duplex ultrasound. This is a type of scan to check your blood flow. This helps to confirm if you have varicose veins and helps to plan your treatment.\nThere are different types of treatment that may be offered, including:\n- procedures to block blood flow in the veins – like endothermal ablation and foam sclerotherapy\n- surgery to remove varicose veins\n- compression stockings\nThe specialist will explain which treatment may be best for you. They&#8217;ll also explain the benefits and risks.\nEndothermal ablation is usually the first choice of treatment for varicose veins. It blocks blood flow in the veins so that they become less swollen.\nThere are 2 types of endothermal ablation.\nRadiofrequency ablation involves heating the wall of your varicose vein using radiofrequency energy.\nDuring the procedure:\nEndovenous laser treatment involves heating the wall of your varicose vein using energy from radio waves.\nDuring the procedure:\nYou&#8217;ll usually be awake during these procedures. You&#8217;ll have a local anaesthetic so that you don&#8217;t feel any pain.\nYou may need to wear compression stockings for about a week. You may have some pain and bruising, but you should be able to go back to most of your usual activities straight away.\nYou&#8217;ll usually be offered foam sclerotherapy if endothermal ablation is not suitable for you.\nYou&#8217;ll be awake during the procedure. You&#8217;ll have a local anaesthetic so that you don&#8217;t feel any pain.\nDuring the procedure:\nYou&#8217;ll have the procedure in a hospital or clinic. You&#8217;ll be able to go home the same day.\nYou may need to wear compression stockings for about a week. You may have some pain and bruising, but you should be able to go back to most of your usual activities straight away.\nYou may be offered surgery to remove varicose veins if other procedures are not suitable for you. Surgery to remove varicose veins is called ligation and stripping.\nYou&#8217;ll usually be asleep during the operation. You&#8217;ll have a general anaesthetic so you won&#8217;t feel any pain.\nDuring the procedure:\nYou can usually go home the same day. Moving around may be uncomfortable for a few days, and you may have some pain and bruising for a few weeks. You may need to take 1 to 2 weeks off work.\nYour leg will be tightly bandaged or you&#8217;ll need to wear compression stockings for about a week.\nCompression stockings put pressure on your lower legs. This improves blood flow and can help pain and swelling.\nYou&#8217;ll only be offered compression stockings for varicose veins if:\n- procedures or surgery are not suitable for you, or\n- you do not need other treatments\nIf you&#8217;re pregnant and have varicose veins, you may be offered compression stockings.\nCompression stockings are not suitable if you have problems with blood flow in your arteries. A specialist can check for this.\nThere are different types of compression stockings. It&#8217;s important to talk to a doctor or pharmacist to make sure you get the right type for you.\nYou&#8217;ll usually need to wear compression stockings during the day and take them off at night.\nIf the stockings make your skin dry, apply a moisturising cream before going to bed.\nCompression stockings usually have to be replaced every 3 to 6 months. If your stockings get damaged, speak to your GP practice.\nVaricose veins happen when the valves that control the flow of blood in your vein don&#8217;t work properly. This causes blood to build up and put pressure on the vein, which makes it swell and twist.\nAnyone can get varicose veins but they&#8217;re more likely if you:\n- are a woman\n- are older\n- are overweight\n- are pregnant\n- spend a lot of time sitting or standing\n- have other family members with varicose veins\n- have had deep vein thrombosis (DVT)\nMost people with varicose veins won&#8217;t develop any complications. If you do, it&#8217;ll usually be many years after your varicose veins first appeared.\nSome complications of varicose veins include:\n- bleeding\n- varicose eczema – itchy, flaky and dry skin over your varicose veins\n- superficial vein thrombosis – blood clots that cause hard, painful veins\n- deep vein thrombosis (DVT) – blood clots deeper inside your leg\n- venous leg ulcers – sore that take a long time to heal\nIf you have varicose veins, there are things you can do to help your symptoms."

        "disease": "Venous leg ulcer",
        "description": "A leg ulcer is a long-lasting (chronic) sore. They usually develop on the inside of the leg, just above the ankle.\nVenous leg ulcers are open, often painful, sores in the skin that take more than a month to heal. Skin changes can vary on different skin colours.\nIf you have a venous leg ulcer, you may also have:\n- swollen ankles (oedema)\n- discolouration and darkening of the skin around the ulcer\n- hardened skin around the ulcer\n- a heavy feeling in your legs\n- aching or swelling in your legs\n- red, flaky, scaly and itchy skin on your legs (varicose eczema)\n- swollen and enlarged veins on your legs (varicose veins)\nA venous leg ulcer can be prone to bacterial infection.\nSymptoms of an infected leg ulcer can include:\n- worsening pain\n- a green or unpleasant discharge coming from the ulcer\n- a high temperature (fever)\nSpeak to your GP practice if you think you have a venous leg ulcer. The ulcer is unlikely to heal without specialist treatment.\nThey will discuss your symptoms and examine the affected leg to help diagnose a venous leg ulcer. However, they may also need to do some other tests.\nYour GP or practice nurse will ask whether you have any other symptoms associated with venous leg ulcers, including:\n- swelling in your ankles\n- discoloured or hard skin\nThey’ll try to work out the cause of the ulcer by asking about underlying conditions or previous injuries, such as:\n- diabetes\n- deep vein thrombosis (DVT)\n- injury or surgery in the affected leg\n- a previous leg ulcer\nThey&#8217;ll also examine your leg when you&#8217;re standing up and lying down.\nThey’ll also feel your pulse at your ankles to make sure the arteries in your leg are working properly.\nYou GP or nurse will carry out a test called the Doppler study. This helps to rule out peripheral arterial disease (a condition affecting the arteries).\nThis involves measuring the blood pressure in the arteries at your ankles and comparing it to the pressure in your arms. If you have peripheral arterial disease, the blood pressure in your ankles will be lower than your arms.\nIt’s important to carry out this check as the main treatment for venous ulcers is compression bandages or stockings. This improves the vein circulation in your legs. It’s not safe to apply compression if the ankle artery pressures are low.\nIn some cases, your GP or nurse may decide to refer you to a specialist in conditions affecting the blood vessels (vascular specialist).\nFor example, you may be referred to a vascular specialist if your GP or nurse is unsure about your diagnosis, or if they suspect your ulcer may be caused by:\n- artery diseases\n- diabetes\n- rheumatoid arthritis\nThe specialist will discuss your medical history and examine you. They may also need to arrange further investigations to plan your treatment.\nMost venous leg ulcers heal within 6 months with treatment.\nThe first step is to remove any debris or dead tissue from the ulcer and apply an appropriate dressing. This provides the best conditions for the ulcer to heal.\nA simple, non-sticky dressing will be used to dress your ulcer. This usually needs to be changed once a week. Many people find they can manage cleaning and dressing their own ulcer under the supervision of a nurse.\nTo improve vein circulation in your legs and treat swelling, your nurse will apply a firm compression bandage over the affected leg. These bandages are designed to squeeze your legs and encourage blood to flow upwards, towards your heart.\nThere are many different types of bandage or elastic stockings used to treat venous leg ulcers, which may be made in 2 to 4 different layers.\nThe bandage is changed once a week, when the dressing is changed.\nWhen compression bandages are first applied to an unhealthy ulcer, it’s usually painful.\nIdeally, you should have paracetamol or an alternative painkiller prescribed by your GP. You can get paracetamol from your local pharmacist or your GP. The pain will lessen once the ulcer starts to heal.\nIt’s important to wear your compression bandage exactly as instructed. If you have any problems, it’s usually best to contact your nurse, instead of trying to remove it yourself. If the compression bandage feels a little too tight and is uncomfortable in bed at night, getting up for a short walk will usually help.\nHowever, you’ll need to cut the bandage off if:\n- you get severe pain at the front of your ankle\n- you get severe pain on the top of your foot\n- your toes become blue and swollen\nOnce you remove the bandage, keep your leg elevated and contact your doctor or nurse as soon as possible.\nIn some clinics, specialist teams are using new alternatives to compression bandages. These include:\n- special stockings\n- other compressive devices\nThese may not be available in every clinic. Your specialist will be able to advise you whether a different approach may help you.\nVenous leg ulcers are often accompanied by swelling of your feet and ankles (oedema), which is caused by fluid. This can be controlled by compression bandages.\nSome people with venous leg ulcers develop rashes with scaly and itchy skin.\nThis is often due to varicose eczema, which can be treated with a moisturiser (emollient). Sometimes a mild corticosteroid cream or ointment can also help. In rare cases, you may need to be referred to a dermatologist (skin specialist) for treatment.\nItchy skin can also sometimes be caused by an allergic reaction to the dressings or creams applied by your nurse. If this happens, you may need to be tested for allergies.\nIt’s important to avoid scratching your legs if they feel itchy because this damages the skin and may lead to further ulcers.\nIf your ulcer becomes infected, it should be cleaned and dressed as usual.\nYou should also elevate your leg most of the time and you’ll be prescribed a 7-day course of antibiotics.\nAntibiotic treatment aims to clear the infection. However, antibiotics don’t heal ulcers and should only be used in short courses to treat infected ulcers.\nOnce you’ve had a venous leg ulcer, another ulcer could develop.\nThe most effective method of preventing this is to wear compression stockings at all times when you’re out of bed. Your nurse will help you find a stocking that fits correctly and that you can manage yourself.\nVarious accessories are available to help you put them on and take them off.\nA venous leg ulcer can develop after a minor injury if there’s a problem with the circulation of blood in your leg veins. If this happens, pressure inside the veins increases.\nThis constant high pressure can gradually damage the tiny blood vessels in your skin and make it fragile. As a result, your skin can easily break and form an ulcer after a knock or scratch.\nUnless you have treatment to improve the circulation in your legs, the ulcer may not heal.\nMany factors can increase your risk of developing a venous leg ulcer, including:\n- obesity or being overweight – this increases the pressure in the leg veins\n- if you have difficulty walking – this can weaken the calf muscles, which can affect circulation in the leg veins\n- previous deep vein thrombosis (DVT) – blood clots that develop in the leg can damage valves in the veins\n- varicose veins – swollen and enlarged veins caused by malfunctioning valves\n- previous injury to the leg, such as a broken or fractured bone, which may cause DVT or affect your walking\n- previous surgery to the leg, such as a hip replacement or knee replacement, which can prevent you from moving about\n- increasing age – some people find it harder to move around as they get older, particularly if they suffer from arthritis\nThere are ways to help prevent venous leg ulcers. For example, you could:\n- wear compression stockings – this may be recommended by your GP\n- manage your weight – if you’re obese or overweight, losing weight can help treat and prevent venous leg ulcers\nPeople most at risk of developing a venous leg ulcer are those who have previously had a leg ulcer."

        "description": "Vertigo is a symptom, rather than a condition itself. It’s the feeling that you, or the environment around you, is moving or spinning.\nThis feeling may be barely noticeable, or it may be so severe that you find it difficult to keep your balance and do everyday tasks.\nVertigo can develop suddenly and last for a few seconds or much longer. If you have severe vertigo, your symptoms may be constant and last for several days, making daily life very difficult.\nSymptoms of vertigo may include:\n- loss of balance – which can make it difficult to stand or walk\n- feeling sick or being sick\n- dizziness\nYou have vertigo and:\nYou have vertigo and:\nYour GP will ask about your symptoms and can carry out an examination to help determine some types of vertigo. They may also refer you for further tests.\nInner ear problems, which affect balance, are the most common causes of vertigo. It can also be caused by problems in certain parts of the brain.\nCommon causes of vertigo may include:\n- benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) – where certain head movements trigger vertigo\n- migraine\n- labyrinthitis or vestibular neuronitis – an inner ear infection\n- persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD)\n- Ménière’s disease\nLess commonly, vertigo can sometimes be caused by conditions that affect certain parts of the brain. This can include:\n- a stroke\n- multiple sclerosis\n- brain tumours\nDepending on the condition causing vertigo, you may have other symptoms, such as:\n- a high temperature\n- ringing in your ears (tinnitus)\n- hearing loss\nMost people with vertigo get better without treatment. Treatment will depend on the cause.\nMedicines, such as prochlorperazine and some antihistamines, can help in most cases of vertigo.\nYour GP may refer you to an ear nose and throat (ENT) specialist or a balance physiotherapist if needed.\nThere may be things you can do yourself to help your symptoms, and reduce how often you have vertigo.\nIf you have vertigo, there are some safety issues to consider. For example:\n- you should tell your employer if your job involves operating machinery or climbing ladders\n- you may have a higher chance of falling – read about preventing falls for advice on reducing your risk\nIf you drive, you must tell the DVLA about your vertigo.\nFurther information on driving with vertigo on GOV.UK\nThe term vertigo is often incorrectly used to describe a fear of heights.

        "disease": "Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia",
        "description": "Vitamin B12 or B9 (commonly called folate) deficiency anaemia occurs when a lack of vitamin B12 or folate causes the body to produce abnormally large red blood cells that can&#8217;t function properly.\nRed blood cells carry oxygen around the body using a substance called haemoglobin.\nAnaemia is the general term&nbsp;for having either fewer red blood cells than normal or having an abnormally low amount of haemoglobin in each red blood cell.\nThere are several different types of anaemia, and each one has a different cause. For example, iron deficiency anaemia, which occurs&nbsp;when the body doesn&#8217;t contain enough iron.\nVitamin B12 and folate perform several important functions in the body, including keeping the nervous system healthy.\nA deficiency in either of these vitamins can cause a wide range of problems, including:\n- extreme tiredness\n- a lack of energy\n- pins and needles (paraesthesia)\n- a sore and red tongue\n- mouth ulcers\n- muscle weakness\n- disturbed vision\n- psychological problems, which may include depression&nbsp;and&nbsp;confusion&nbsp;\n- problems with&nbsp;memory, understanding and judgement\nSome of these problems can also occur if you have a deficiency in vitamin B12 or folate, but don&#8217;t have anaemia.\nRead about the symptoms of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia\nSee your GP if you think you may have a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. These conditions can often be diagnosed based on your symptoms and the results of a&nbsp;blood test.\nIt&#8217;s important for vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia to be diagnosed and treated as soon as possible because, although many of the symptoms improve with treatment, some problems caused by the condition can be irreversible.\nRead about&nbsp;diagnosing vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia\nThere are a number of problems that can lead to a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, including:\n- pernicious anaemia – where your immune system attacks healthy cells in your stomach, preventing your body from absorbing vitamin B12 from the food you eat; this&nbsp;is the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in the UK\n- a lack of these vitamins in your diet – this is uncommon, but can occur if you have a vegan diet, follow a fad diet or have a generally poor diet for a long time\n- medication – certain medications, including anticonvulsants and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), can affect how much of these vitamins your body absorbs&nbsp;\nBoth vitamin B12 deficiency and folate deficiency are more common in older people, affecting around 1 in 10 people aged 75 or over, and 1 in 20 people aged 65 to 74.\nRead about the causes of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia\nMost cases of vitamin B12 and folate deficiency can be&nbsp;easily treated with injections or tablets to replace the&nbsp;missing vitamins.\nVitamin B12 supplements are usually given by injection at first. Then, depending on whether your B12 deficiency is related to your diet, you&#8217;ll either require B12 tablets between meals&nbsp;or regular injections. These treatments may be needed for the rest of your life.\nFolic acid tablets are used to restore folate levels. These usually need to be taken for four months.\nIn some cases, improving your diet can help treat the condition and prevent it recurring. Vitamin B12 is found in meat, fish, eggs,&nbsp;dairy products, yeast extract (such as Marmite) and specially fortified foods. The best sources of folate include green vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts and peas.\nRead about treating vitamin B12 or folate deficiency\nAlthough it&#8217;s uncommon, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency (with or without anaemia) can lead to complications, particularly if you&#8217;ve been deficient in vitamin B12 or folate for some time.\nPotential complications can include:\n- problems with the nervous system\n- temporary infertility\n- heart conditions\n- pregnancy complications and birth defects\nAdults with severe anaemia are also at risk of developing heart failure.\nSome&nbsp;complications improve with appropriate treatment, but others – such as problems with the nervous system – can be permanent.&nbsp;\nRead about the complications of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia\nVitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia can cause a wide range of symptoms. These usually develop gradually but can worsen if the condition goes untreated.\nAnaemia is where&nbsp;you have fewer red blood cells than normal or&nbsp;you have&nbsp;an abnormally low amount&nbsp;of a substance called haemoglobin in each red blood cell. General symptoms of anaemia may include:\n- extreme tiredness (fatigue)\n- lack of energy (lethargy)\n- breathlessness\n- feeling faint\n- headaches\n- pale skin\n- noticeable heartbeats (palpitations)\n- hearing sounds&nbsp;coming from inside the body, rather than from an outside source (tinnitus)\n- loss of appetite and weight loss\nIf you have anaemia caused by a vitamin B12 deficiency, you may have other&nbsp;symptoms in addition to those listed above, such as:\n- a pale yellow tinge to your skin\n- a sore and red tongue (glossitis)\n- mouth ulcers\n- pins and needles (paraesthesia)\n- changes in the way that you walk and move around\n- disturbed vision\n- irritability\n- depression\n- changes in the&nbsp;way you think, feel and behave\n- a decline in your mental abilities, such as&nbsp;memory, understanding and judgement (dementia)\nSome of these symptoms can also occur in people who have a vitamin B12 deficiency, but have not developed anaemia.\nAdditional symptoms in people with&nbsp;anaemia caused by a folate deficiency can include:\n- symptoms related to anaemia\n- reduced sense of taste\n- diarrhoea\n- numbness and tingling in the feet and hands\n- muscle weakness\n- depression\nSee your GP if you&#8217;re experiencing symptoms of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia.&nbsp;These conditions can often be diagnosed based on your symptoms and the results of a blood test.\nRead more about diagnosing&nbsp;vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia\nIt&#8217;s important for&nbsp;vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia to be diagnosed and treated as soon as possible. Although many of the symptoms improve with treatment, some problems caused by the condition can be irreversible if left untreated. The longer the condition goes untreated, the higher the chance of permanent damage.\nVitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia occurs when a lack of either of these vitamins affects the body&#8217;s ability to produce fully functioning red blood cells.\nRed blood cells carry oxygen around the body. Most people with&nbsp;vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia have underdeveloped red blood cells that are&nbsp;larger than normal. The medical term for this is &#8220;megaloblastic anaemia&#8221;.\nA vitamin B12 or folate deficiency can be the result of a variety of problems, some of which are described below.\nPernicious anaemia is the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in the UK.\nPernicious anaemia is an autoimmune condition that affects your stomach. An autoimmune condition means&nbsp;your&nbsp;immune system (the body&#8217;s natural defence system that protects against illness and infection) attacks your body&#8217;s healthy cells.\nIn your stomach, vitamin B12&nbsp;is combined with&nbsp;a&nbsp;protein called intrinsic factor. This mix of vitamin B12 and intrinsic factor is then absorbed into the body in part of the gut called the distal ileum.\nPernicious anaemia causes your immune system to attack the cells in your stomach that produce the intrinsic factor, which means&nbsp;your body is unable to absorb vitamin B12.\nThe exact cause&nbsp;of pernicious anaemia is unknown, but the condition is more common in&nbsp;women around 60 years of age, people with a family history of the condition and those with another autoimmune condition, such as&nbsp;Addison&#8217;s disease or&nbsp;vitiligo.\nSome people can develop a vitamin B12 deficiency as a result of not getting enough vitamin B12 from their diet.\nA diet that includes meat, fish and dairy products usually provides enough vitamin B12, but people who don&#8217;t regularly eat these foods – such as those following a&nbsp;vegan diet or who have&nbsp;a generally&nbsp;very poor diet – can become deficient.\nStores of vitamin B12 in the body can&nbsp;last&nbsp;around two to four years without being replenished, so it can take a long time for&nbsp;any problems to develop after a dietary change.\nSome stomach conditions or stomach operations can prevent the absorption of&nbsp;enough vitamin B12.\nFor example, a&nbsp;gastrectomy (a surgical procedure where part of your stomach is removed) increases your risk of developing a vitamin B12 deficiency.\nSome conditions that affect your intestines&nbsp;can also&nbsp;stop you from absorbing the necessary amount of vitamin B12.\nFor example, Crohn&#8217;s disease (a long-term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system) can sometimes mean your body doesn&#8217;t get enough vitamin B12.\nSome types of medicine can lead to a reduction in&nbsp;the amount of vitamin B12 in your body.\nFor example, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) – a medication sometimes used to&nbsp;treat indigestion – can make a vitamin B12 deficiency worse. PPIs inhibit the production of stomach acid, which is needed to release vitamin B12 from the food you eat.\nYour GP will be aware of medicines that can affect your vitamin B12 levels and will monitor you if necessary.\nSome people can experience problems related to a vitamin B12 deficiency, despite appearing to have normal levels of vitamin B12 in their blood.\nThis can occur due to a problem known as functional vitamin B12 deficiency – where there&#8217;s a problem with the proteins that help transport vitamin B12 between cells. This results in&nbsp;neurological complications involving the spinal cord.\nFolate dissolves in water, which means your body is unable to store it for long periods of time. Your body&#8217;s store of folate is usually enough to last four months. This means you need folate in your daily diet to ensure your body has sufficient stores of the vitamin.\nLike vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia, folate deficiency anaemia can develop for a number of reasons. Some are described below.\nGood&nbsp;sources of folate include&nbsp;broccoli, Brussels sprouts, asparagus, peas, chickpeas and brown rice. If you don&#8217;t regularly eat these types of foods, you may develop a folate deficiency.\nFolate deficiency caused by a lack of dietary folate is more common in people who have a generally unbalanced and unhealthy diet, people who regularly misuse alcohol and people following a fad diet that doesn&#8217;t involve eating good sources of folate.\nSometimes your body may be unable to absorb folate as effectively as it should. This is usually due to an underlying condition affecting your digestive system, such as&nbsp;coeliac disease.\nYou may lose folate from your body if you urinate frequently. This can be caused by an underlying condition that affects one of your organs, such as:\n- congestive heart failure – where the heart is unable to pump enough blood around the body\n- acute liver damage – often caused by drinking excessive amounts of alcohol\n- long-term&nbsp;dialysis – where a machine that replicates the kidney function is used to filter waste products from the blood\nSome types of medicine reduce the amount of folate in your body, or make the folate harder to absorb.\nThese include some&nbsp;anticonvulsants (medication used to treat epilepsy), colestyramine, sulfasalazine and methotrexate.\nYour GP will be aware of medicines that can affect your folate levels and will monitor you if necessary.\nYour body sometimes requires more folate than normal. This can cause folate deficiency&nbsp;if you can&#8217;t meet your body&#8217;s demands for the vitamin.\nYour body may need more folate than usual if you:\n- are pregnant (see below)\n- have cancer\n- have a blood disorder – such as&nbsp;sickle cell anaemia (an inherited blood disorder which causes red blood cells to develop abnormally)\n- are fighting an infection or health condition that causes inflammation (redness and swelling)\nPremature babies (born before the 37th week&nbsp;of pregnancy) are also more&nbsp;likely to develop a folate deficiency, because their developing bodies require higher amounts of folate than normal.\nIf you&#8217;re pregnant or trying to get pregnant, it&#8217;s recommended that you take a 400 microgram folic acid tablet every day until you&#8217;re 12 weeks pregnant. This will ensure that both you and your baby have enough folate and help your baby grow and develop.\nFolic acid tablets are available with a prescription from your GP, or you can buy them over the counter from pharmacies, large supermarkets and health food stores.\nIf you&#8217;re pregnant and have another condition that may increase your body&#8217;s need for folate, such as those mentioned above, your GP will monitor you closely to prevent you from becoming anaemic.\nIn some cases, you may need a higher dose of folic acid. For example, if you have diabetes, you should take a 5 milligrams (5mg or 5,000 micrograms) supplement of folic acid instead of the standard 0.4 milligrams (0.4mg or 400 micrograms).\nRead more about vitamins and minerals in pregnancy\nA diagnosis of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia can often be made by your GP based on your symptoms and the results of blood tests.\nDifferent types of&nbsp;blood tests can be carried out to&nbsp;help identify people with a possible&nbsp;vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. These tests check:\n- whether you have a lower level of haemoglobin (a substance that transports oxygen)&nbsp;than normal\n- whether your red blood cells are larger than normal\n- the level of vitamin B12 in your blood\n- the level&nbsp;of&nbsp;folate in your blood\nHowever, some people can have problems with their normal levels of these vitamins&nbsp;or may&nbsp;have low levels despite having no symptoms.&nbsp;This is why it&#8217;s important for your symptoms to be taken into account when a diagnosis is made.\nA particular drawback of testing vitamin B12 levels is that the current widely-used blood test only measures the total amount of vitamin B12 in your blood.\nThis means&nbsp;it measures&nbsp;forms of vitamin B12 that are &#8220;active&#8221; and can be used by your body, as well as the &#8220;inactive&#8221; forms, which can&#8217;t. If a significant amount of the vitamin B12 in your blood is &#8220;inactive&#8221;, a blood test may show that you have normal B12 levels,&nbsp;even though your body can&#8217;t use much of it.\nThere are some types of blood test that&nbsp;may help determine if the vitamin B12 in your blood can be used by your body, but these aren&#8217;t yet widely available.\nIf your symptoms and blood test results suggest a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, your GP may arrange further tests. If the cause can be identified,&nbsp;it will&nbsp;help&nbsp;to determine the most appropriate treatment.\nFor example,&nbsp;you may have additional blood tests to check for a condition called pernicious anaemia. This is an autoimmune condition (where your immune system produces antibodies to attack healthy cells), which means you&#8217;re unable to absorb vitamin B12 from the food you eat.\nTests for pernicious anaemia aren&#8217;t always conclusive, but they can often&nbsp;give your GP a good idea of whether you have the condition.\nYou may be referred to a specialist for further tests or treatment. This may include:\n- a&nbsp;haematologist (specialist in treating blood conditions) –&nbsp;if you have vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia and your GP is uncertain of the cause, you&#8217;re pregnant or symptoms suggest your nervous system has been affected\n- a&nbsp;gastroenterologist (specialist in conditions that affect the digestive system) –&nbsp;if your GP suspects you don&#8217;t have enough vitamin B12 or folate because your digestive system isn&#8217;t absorbing it properly\n- a&nbsp;dietitian (specialist in nutrition) – if your GP suspects you&nbsp;have a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency caused by a poor diet\nA&nbsp;dietitian can devise a personalised eating plan for you to increase the amount of vitamin B12 or folate in your diet.\n&nbsp;\nThe treatment for vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia depends on what&#8217;s causing the condition. Most people can be easily treated with injections or tablets to replace the missing vitamins.\nVitamin B12 deficiency anaemia is usually treated with injections of vitamin B12, in a form called hydroxocobalamin.\nAt first, you&#8217;ll have these injections every other day for two weeks, or until your symptoms have stopped improving. Your GP or nurse will give the injections.\nAfter this initial&nbsp;period, your&nbsp;treatment will depend on whether the cause of your vitamin B12 deficiency is related to your diet. The most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in the UK is pernicious anaemia, which isn&#8217;t related to your diet.\nRead more about the causes of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency\nIf your vitamin B12 deficiency is caused by a lack of the vitamin in your diet, you may be prescribed vitamin B12 tablets to take every day between meals. Alternatively, you may need to have an injection of hydroxocobalamin twice a year.\nPeople who find it difficult to get enough vitamin B12 in their diets, such as&nbsp;those following a vegan diet, may need vitamin B12 tablets for life.\nAlthough it&#8217;s less common, people&nbsp;with vitamin B12 deficiency caused by a prolonged poor diet may be advised&nbsp;to stop taking the tablets once their vitamin B12 levels have returned to normal and&nbsp;their diet has improved.\nGood sources of vitamin B12 include:\n- meat\n- salmon and cod\n- milk and other dairy products\n- eggs\nIf you&#8217;re a vegetarian and vegan, or&nbsp;are looking for alternatives to meat and dairy products, there are other foods that contain vitamin B12, such as yeast extract (including Marmite), as well as some fortified breakfast cereals and soy products.\nCheck the nutrition labels while food shopping to see how much vitamin B12&nbsp;different foods contain.\nIf your vitamin B12 deficiency isn&#8217;t caused by a lack of vitamin B12 in your diet, you&#8217;ll usually need to have an injection of hydroxocobalamin every three months for the rest of your life.\nIf you&#8217;ve had neurological symptoms (symptoms that affect your nervous system, such as numbness&nbsp;or tingling in your hands and feet) caused by a vitamin B12 deficiency, you&#8217;ll be referred to a haematologist, and you may need to have injections every two months. Your haematologist will advise&nbsp;on&nbsp;how long you need to keep taking the injections.\nFor&nbsp;injections of vitamin B12 given in the UK, hydroxocobalamin is preferred to an alternative called cyanocobalamin. This is because hydroxocobalamin stays in the body for longer.\nIf you need regular injections of vitamin B12, cyanocobalamin&nbsp;would need to be given once a month, whereas hydroxocobalamin can be given every three months.\nCyanocobalamin injections aren&#8217;t routinely available on the NHS. However, if you need replacement tablets of vitamin B12, these will be cyanocobalamin.\nTo treat folate deficiency anaemia, your GP will usually prescribe daily folic acid&nbsp;tablets to build up your folate levels. They may also give you&nbsp;dietary advice so you can increase your folate intake.\nGood sources of folate include:\n- broccoli\n- Brussels sprouts\n- asparagus\n- peas\n- chickpeas\n- brown rice\nMost people need to take folic acid tablets for about four months. However, if the underlying cause of your folate deficiency anaemia continues, you may have to take folic acid tablets for longer – possibly for life.\nBefore you start taking folic acid, your GP will check your vitamin B12 levels to make sure they&#8217;re normal. This is because folic acid treatment can sometimes improve your symptoms so much that it masks an underlying vitamin B12 deficiency.\nIf a vitamin B12 deficiency isn&#8217;t detected and treated, it could affect your nervous system.\nTo ensure your treatment is working, you may need to have further&nbsp;blood tests.\nA&nbsp;blood test is often carried out around 10-14 days after starting treatment to assess whether treatment is working. This&nbsp;is to check your haemoglobin level and the number of the immature red blood cells (reticulocytes) in your blood.\nAnother blood test may also be carried out after approximately eight weeks to confirm your treatment has been successful.\nIf you&#8217;ve been taking folic acid tablets, you may be tested again once the treatment has finished (usually after four months).\nMost people who have had a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency won&#8217;t need further monitoring unless their symptoms return, or their treatment is ineffective. If your GP feels&nbsp;it&#8217;s necessary, you may have to return for an annual blood test to see whether your condition has returned.\nAs most cases of vitamin B12 deficiency or folate deficiency can be easily and effectively treated, complications are rare.\nHowever, complications can occasionally develop, particularly if you&#8217;ve been deficient&nbsp;in either vitamin&nbsp;for some time.\nAll types of anaemia, regardless of the cause, can lead to heart and lung complications as the heart struggles to pump oxygen to the vital organs.\nAdults with severe anaemia are at risk of developing:\n- an abnormally fast heart beat&nbsp;(tachycardia)\n- heart failure – where the heart fails to pump enough blood around the body at the right pressure\nA lack of vitamin B12 (with or without anaemia) can cause the following complications:\nA lack of vitamin B12 can cause neurological problems (issues affecting your nervous system), such as:\n- vision problems\n- memory loss\n- pins and needles (paraesthesia)\n- loss of physical coordination (ataxia), which can affect your whole body and cause difficulty speaking or walking\n- damage to parts of the nervous system (peripheral neuropathy), particularly in the legs\nIf neurological problems do develop, they may be irreversible.\nVitamin B12 deficiency can sometimes&nbsp;lead to temporary infertility (an inability to conceive). This&nbsp;usually improves with appropriate vitamin B12 treatment.\nIf you have a vitamin B12 deficiency caused by pernicious anaemia (a condition where your immune system attacks healthy cells in your stomach), your risk of developing stomach cancer is increased.\nIf you&#8217;re pregnant, not having enough vitamin B12 can increase the risk of your baby developing a serious birth defect known as a&nbsp;neural tube defect. The neural tube is a narrow channel that eventually&nbsp;forms the brain and spinal cord.&nbsp;\nExamples of neural tube defects include:\n- spina bifida – where the baby&#8217;s spine doesn&#8217;t develop properly\n- anencephaly – where&nbsp;a baby is born without parts of the brain and skull\n- encephalocele – where a membrane or skin-covered sac containing part of the brain pushes out of a hole in the skull\nA lack of folate (with or without anaemia) can also cause complications, some of which are outlined below.\nAs with a lack of vitamin B12, a folate deficiency can also affect your fertility. However,&nbsp;this is only temporary and can usually be reversed&nbsp;with folate supplements.\nResearch has shown a lack of folate in your body may increase your risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).\nCVD is a general term that describes a disease of the heart or blood vessels, such as coronary heart disease (CHD).\nResearch has shown that folate deficiency can increase your risk of some cancers, such as&nbsp;colon cancer.\nA&nbsp;lack of folate during pregnancy may increase the risk of the baby being born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy) or having a low birthweight.\nThe risk of&nbsp;placental abruption may also be increased. This&nbsp;is a serious condition where the placenta starts to come away from the inside of the womb wall, causing&nbsp;tummy (abdominal) pain and bleeding from the vagina.\nAs with a vitamin B12 deficiency, a lack of folate can also affect an unborn baby&#8217;s growth and development in the womb (uterus). This increases the risk of neural tube defects such as spina bifida developing in the unborn baby."

This is an infection of the gut usually caused by bacteria or a virus. It&#8217;ll normally improve within a few days.&nbsp;\nVomiting can occasionally be a sign of something more serious, such as appendicitis.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nThere is a separate page on vomiting in children and babies.&nbsp;\nComplete our self-help guide to check your symptoms and find out what to do next.\nYou&#8217;re vomiting and you also have:\nIf you have diarrhoea&nbsp;as well as vomiting, it&#8217;s likely you have gastroenteritis. This is one of the most common causes of vomiting in adults.&nbsp;\nIt&#8217;s often caused by:&nbsp;\n- a virus, like norovirus\n- food poisoning caused by bacteria in contaminated food&nbsp;\nYour immune system will usually fight off the infection after a few days.&nbsp;\nPregnant women often experience nausea and vomiting, particularly during the early stages of pregnancy. This is often called morning sickness&nbsp;but it can happen at any time of the day.\nIf you have recurrent episodes of vomiting along with intense, throbbing headaches that last for a few hours to days at a time, you may be experiencing migraines.&nbsp;\nPain relief, such as paracetamol&nbsp;and ibuprofen, can sometimes help control the pain. Your GP can prescribe anti-sickness medicine to help prevent vomiting.&nbsp;\nIf you also feel dizzy, or feel like you&#8217;re spinning (vertigo), you may have an inner ear infection called labyrinthitis.&nbsp;\nLabyrinthitis will usually improve over a few days. Your GP can prescribe medication to reduce your symptoms if needed.&nbsp;\nNausea and vomiting when travelling could be a sign of motion sickness.\nYou can try:\n- looking at the horizon\n- distracting yourself by listening to music\nAs well as vomiting, appendicitis&nbsp;can cause severe pain in your abdomen (tummy). You should phone 999 for an ambulance if you experience pain that suddenly becomes worse and spreads across your abdomen. These are signs that you appendix may have burst.\nIf you have appendicitis, you will often need surgery to remove your appendix.\nVomiting in adults can also be caused by a number of other things, including:\n- certain medicines, such as antibiotics&nbsp;and opioid painkillers&nbsp;\n- drinking too much alcohol&nbsp;\n- kidney infections and kidney stones&nbsp;\n- a blockage in your bowel, which may be caused by a hernia or gallstones\n- chemotherapy&nbsp;or radiotherapy\n- acute cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder)&nbsp;\nMostly, you can take care of yourself at home until you feel better."

Make sure they keep drinking fluids to prevent dehydration.\nIf your baby is vomiting, carry on breastfeeding or giving them milk feeds. If they seem dehydrated, they&#8217;ll need extra fluids.\nChildren who are vomiting should keep taking small sips of clear fluid, such as water or clear broth. Fruit juice and fizzy drinks should be avoided until they&#8217;re feeling better. If they&#8217;re not dehydrated and haven&#8217;t lost their appetite, it&#8217;s fine for your child to eat solid foods as normal.\nSpeak to your GP or pharmacist if you&#8217;re concerned about dehydration.

        "disease": "Vulval cancer",
        "description": "Cancer of the vulva is a rare type of cancer that affects women and anyone with a vulva.\nThe vulva is a woman&#8217;s external genitals. It includes&nbsp;the lips surrounding the vagina (labia minora and labia majora), the clitoris (sexual organ&nbsp;that helps reach sexual climax), and the Bartholin&#8217;s glands (2&nbsp;small glands each side of the vagina).\nMost of those affected by vulval cancer are older women and anyone with a vulva over the age of 65. The condition is rare in women and anyone with a vulva under 50 who have not yet gone through the menopause.\nSymptoms of vulval cancer can include:\n- a persistent itch in the vulva\n- pain, soreness or tenderness&nbsp;in&nbsp;the vulva\n- raised and thickened patches of skin that can&nbsp;be red, white or dark\n- a lump or wart-like growth on the vulva\n- bleeding from the vulva or&nbsp;blood-stained&nbsp;vaginal discharge between periods\n- an open sore in the vulva\n- a burning pain&nbsp;when passing urine\n- a&nbsp;mole on the vulva that changes shape or colour\nSpeak to your GP if you notice any changes in the usual appearance of your vulva. While it&#8217;s highly unlikely to be the result of&nbsp;cancer, these changes should be investigated.\nRead more about diagnosing vulval cancer.\nThe exact cause of vulval cancer is unclear, but your risk of developing the condition&nbsp;is increased by the following factors:\n- increasing age\n- vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) – where the cells&nbsp;in the vulva are abnormal and at risk of turning cancerous\n- persistent infection with certain versions&nbsp;of the&nbsp;human papilloma virus (HPV)\n- skin conditions affecting the vulva,&nbsp;such as&nbsp;lichen sclerosus\n- smoking\nYou may be able to reduce your risk of vulval cancer by stopping smoking and taking steps to reduce the chances of picking up an HPV infection.\nRead more about the causes of vulval cancer.\nThe main treatment for vulval cancer is surgery to remove the cancerous tissue from the vulva and any lymph nodes containing cancerous cells.\nSome people may also have radiotherapy (where radiation is used to destroy cancer cells) or chemotherapy&nbsp;(where medication is used to kill cancer cells), or both.\nRadiotherapy and chemotherapy may be used without surgery if you&#8217;re not well enough to have an operation, or if&nbsp;the cancer has spread and it isn&#8217;t possible to remove it all.\nRead more about treating vulval cancer.\nIt&#8217;s not thought to be possible to prevent vulval cancer completely, but you may be able to reduce your risk by:\n- practising&nbsp;safer sex&nbsp;– using a condom during sex can offer some protection against HPV\n- attending&nbsp;cervical screening&nbsp;appointments&nbsp;–&nbsp;cervical screening can detect HPV and pre-cancerous conditions such as VIN\n- stopping smoking\nThe&nbsp;HPV vaccination&nbsp;may also reduce your chances of developing vulval cancer. This is offered to all girls&nbsp;who are 12 to 13 years old as part of their routine childhood immunisation programme.\nCancer occurs when the cells in a certain area of your body divide and multiply too rapidly. This produces a lump of tissue known as a tumour.\nThe exact reason why this happens in cases of vulval cancer is unknown, but certain things can increase your chances of developing the condition.\nThese include:\n- increasing age\n- vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN)\n- human papilloma virus (HPV) infection\n- skin conditions that can affect the vulva, such as&nbsp;lichen sclerosus\n- smoking\nThe risk of developing vulval cancer increases as you get older. Most cases develop in women and anyone with a vulva aged 65 or over. Very occasionally women and anyone with a vulva under 50 can be affected.\nVulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) is a pre-cancerous condition. This means&nbsp;there are changes to certain cells in the vulva that aren&#8217;t cancerous, but&nbsp;could potentially turn into cancer at a later date. This is a gradual process that&nbsp;usually takes well over 10 years.\nIn some cases, the abnormal cells may go away by themselves. However, because of the risk of cancer, treatment to remove the affected cells is often recommended.\nSymptoms of&nbsp;VIN&nbsp;are similar to those of vulval cancer, and include persistent itchiness&nbsp;of the vulva and raised discoloured patches. Speak to your GP if you have these symptoms.\nThere are 2&nbsp;types of&nbsp;VIN:\n- usual or undifferentiated VIN – this&nbsp;usually affects&nbsp;women and anyone with a vulva under 50 and is thought to be caused by an HPV infection\n- differentiated VIN (dVIN) – this is a rarer type, usually affecting women and anyone with a vulva over 60, associated with skin conditions that affect the vulva\nHuman papilloma virus (HPV) is the name given to a group of viruses that affect the skin and the moist membranes that line the body, such as those in the cervix, anus, mouth and throat.&nbsp;It&#8217;s spread during sex, including anal and oral sex.\nThere are many different types of HPV, and most&nbsp;people are infected with the virus at some time during their lives. In most cases, the virus goes away without causing any harm and doesn&#8217;t lead to further problems.\nHowever, HPV is present in at least 40% of people with vulval cancer, which suggests it may increase your risk of developing the condition. HPV is known to cause changes in the cells of the cervix, which can lead to cervical cancer. It&#8217;s thought the virus could have a similar effect on the cells of the vulva, which is&nbsp;known as VIN.\nSeveral skin conditions can affect the vulva. In a small number of cases these are associated with an increased&nbsp;risk of vulval cancer.\nTwo of the main conditions associated with vulval cancer are lichen sclerosus and&nbsp;lichen planus. Both of these conditions cause the vulva to become itchy, sore and discoloured.\nIt&#8217;s estimated that less than 5% of those who develop one of these conditions will go on to develop vulval cancer. It&#8217;s not clear whether treating these conditions reduces this risk.\nSmoking increases your risk of developing VIN and vulval cancer. This may be because&nbsp;smoking makes the immune system less effective, and less able to clear the HPV virus from your body and more vulnerable to the effects of the virus.\nSpeak to your GP if you notice any changes in the normal appearance of your vulva.\nYour GP will ask you about your symptoms, look at your medical history, and&nbsp;examine your vulva to look for any lumps or unusual areas of skin.\nIf you would prefer to be examined by a&nbsp;female doctor or you would like a nurse present during the examination, it may help to let your GP practice know in advance of your appointment.\nIf your GP feels some further tests are necessary, they will refer you to a hospital specialist called a gynaecologist. A gynaecologist is a specialist in treating conditions of the female reproductive system.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that GPs consider referring a woman who has an unexplained vulval lump or&nbsp;ulcer, or unexplained bleeding.\nThe gynaecologist&nbsp;will&nbsp;ask&nbsp;about your symptoms and examine your vulva again, and they may recommend&nbsp;a&nbsp;test called a biopsy to determine whether you do have cancer.&nbsp;\nA&nbsp;biopsy&nbsp;is where&nbsp;a small sample of&nbsp;tissue is removed so it can be examined under a microscope to see if the cells are cancerous.\nThis is often done&nbsp;after a&nbsp;local anaesthetic has been given to numb the area, which&nbsp;means the procedure shouldn&#8217;t be painful and you can go home the same day. Occasionally, it may be done under&nbsp;general anaesthetic (where you&#8217;re asleep), which may require an overnight stay in hospital.\nYour doctor may put a few stitches in the area where the biopsy was taken from.&nbsp;You may have slight bleeding and soreness for a few days afterwards.\nYour doctor will usually see you 7&nbsp;to 10 days later to discuss the results with you.\nIf the results of the biopsy show cancer, you may need further tests to assess how widespread it is.\nThese may include:\n- a colposcopy&nbsp;–&nbsp;a procedure where a microscope is used to check for abnormal cells in the vagina\n- a cystoscopy&nbsp;– an examination of the inside of the bladder using a thin, hollow&nbsp;tube&nbsp;inserted into the bladder\n- a proctoscopy – an examination of the inside of the rectum\n- biopsies of the lymph nodes near your vulva&nbsp;to&nbsp;check whether cancer has spread through your lymphatic system\n- a computerised tomography (CT) scan&nbsp;or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan&nbsp;– scans to check for signs of cancer in your lymph nodes or other organs\n- an X-ray&nbsp;to check that cancer has not spread to your lungs\nThe results of these tests will allow your doctor to &#8216;stage&#8217; your cancer. This means using a number system to indicate how far the cancer has spread.\nVulval cancers are staged using a number from 1 to 4. The lower the stage, the less the cancer has spread and the greater the chance of treatment being successful.\nThe staging system for vulval cancer is:\n- stage 1 – the cancer is confined to the vulva\n- stage 2 –&nbsp;the cancer has spread to other nearby parts of the body, such as the lower vagina, anus or lower urethra (the tube urine passes through&nbsp;out of the body), but the lymph nodes are unaffected\n- stage 3 – the cancer has spread into nearby lymph nodes\n- stage 4 – the cancer has spread&nbsp;to other parts of the body, including more distant lymph nodes\nStage 1 and 2 vulval cancers are generally regarded as early-stage cancers with a relatively good chance of being treated successfully. Stage 3 and 4 cancers are usually regarded as advanced-stage cancers and a complete cure for these types of cancers may not always be possible.\nTreatment for vulval cancer depends on factors such as how far the cancer has spread, your general health, and personal wishes.\nThe main&nbsp;options are surgery,&nbsp;radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Many women and anyone with a vulva with vulval cancer have a combination of these treatments.\nIf your cancer is at an early stage, it&#8217;s often possible to get rid of it completely.&nbsp;However, this may not be possible if the cancer has spread.\nEven after successful treatment, there is up to a 1&nbsp;in 3&nbsp;chance of the cancer returning at some point later on, so you&#8217;ll need regular follow-up appointments to check for this.\nMost hospitals use multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) to treat vulval cancer. MDTs are teams of specialists that work together to make decisions about the best way to proceed with your treatment.\nMembers of your MDT will probably include a specialist surgeon, a specialist in the non-surgical treatment of cancer (clinical oncologist) and a specialist cancer nurse.\nDeciding which treatment is best for you can often be confusing. Your cancer team will recommend what they think is the best treatment option, but the final decision will be yours.\nBefore visiting hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions you would like to ask the specialist. For example, you may want to find out the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.\nIn most cases, your treatment plan will involve some form of surgery. The type of surgery will depend on the stage of the cancer.\nThere are 3&nbsp;surgical options to treat vulval cancer:\n- radical wide local excision –&nbsp;the cancerous tissue from your vulva is removed, as a well as a margin of healthy tissue, usually at least&nbsp;1cm wide, as a precaution\n- radical partial vulvectomy – a larger section&nbsp;of&nbsp;your vulva is removed, such as 1 or both of the labia and the clitoris\n- radical vulvectomy – the&nbsp;whole vulva is removed, including the inner and outer labia, and possibly the clitoris\nThe time it will take you to recover from surgery will depend on the type of surgery and how extensive it was. For extensive operations, such as a pelvic exenteration, it may be many weeks or months&nbsp;before you start to&nbsp;feel better.\nYour surgeon will talk to you about the possible risks associated with the type of procedure you&#8217;re having. Possible risks include infection, bleeding, blood clots, altered sensation in your vulva, and problems having sex.\nAn additional operation may also be required to assess whether the cancerous cells have spread into one or more lymph nodes in your groin, and remove these if they&#8217;re found to contain cancer.&nbsp;\nIf the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes, it&#8217;s sometimes possible to only remove certain lymph nodes, known as&nbsp;sentinel nodes.\nSentinel&nbsp;nodes are identified by injecting a dye at the site of the tumour and studying&nbsp;its flow&nbsp;to locate the nodes closest to the tumour. These are then removed and checked for cancerous cells.\nIn some cases, some or all of the nodes in your groin&nbsp;may need to be surgically removed. This is called a groin or&nbsp;inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy. Further treatment with radiotherapy may also be&nbsp;recommended.\nRemoving cancerous lymph nodes&nbsp;reduces the risk of the cancer returning, but it can make you more vulnerable to infection and cause swelling in your legs from a build-up of lymphatic fluid (lymphoedema).\nIn cases of advanced vulval cancer or where the cancer returns after previous treatment, an operation called a pelvic exenteration may be recommended. This involves removing your entire vulva as well as your bladder, womb and part of your bowel. This is a major operation and isn&#8217;t carried out very often these days.\nIf a section of your bowel is removed, it will be necessary for your surgeon to divert your bowel through&nbsp;an opening made in your tummy (a stoma). Stools then pass along this piece of bowel and into a bag you wear over the stoma. This is known as&nbsp;a colostomy.\nIf your bladder is removed, urine can be passed out of your body into a pouch via a stoma. This is&nbsp;known as a urostomy. Alternatively,&nbsp;it may be possible to create a new bladder by removing a section of your bowel and using it to create a pouch to store urine in.\nIf only a small amount of tissue has been removed during surgery, the skin of the vulva&nbsp;can often be neatly stitched together.\nOtherwise, it may be necessary to reconstruct the vulva using a&nbsp;skin graft,&nbsp;where a piece of skin is taken from your thigh or&nbsp;tummy and moved to&nbsp;the wound in your&nbsp;vulva. Another option is to have a&nbsp;skin flap, where&nbsp;an&nbsp;area of skin near the vulva is used to create a flap and&nbsp;cover the wound.\nThese reconstructive procedures are usually carried out at the same time as the operation to remove the cancer.\nRadiotherapy involves using high-energy radiation to destroy cancerous cells. There are several ways it&nbsp;can be used to treat vulval cancer:\n- before surgery to&nbsp;try&nbsp;to&nbsp;shrink a large cancer&nbsp;– this is to&nbsp;help make the operation possible without removing nearby organs\n- after surgery&nbsp;to destroy any cancerous cells that may be left&nbsp;– for example, for cases where cancer cells&nbsp;have spread to the lymph nodes in the groin\n- as an alternative to surgery, if you&#8217;re not well enough to have an operation\n- to relieve symptoms in cases where a complete cure is not possible – this is known as palliative radiotherapy\nIn most cases, you&#8217;ll have external radiotherapy, where a machine directs beams of radiation&nbsp;on to the section of the body that contains the cancer.\nThis&nbsp;is normally given in daily sessions, 5&nbsp;days a week, with each session lasting a few minutes.&nbsp;The whole course of treatment will usually last a few weeks.\nWhile radiation is effective in killing cancerous cells, it can also damage healthy tissues. This can&nbsp;lead to a number of side effects, such as:\n- sore skin around the vulva area\n- diarrhoea&nbsp;\n- feeling tired all the time\n- loss of pubic hair, which may be permanent\n- swelling of the vulva\n- narrowing of your vagina, which can make sex difficult\n- inflammation of your bladder (cystitis)\nIn younger people, external radiotherapy can sometimes trigger an early menopause.&nbsp;This means they&nbsp;will no longer be able to have any children.\nRead more about the side effects of radiotherapy.\nChemotherapy is where medication is used to kill cancer cells. It&#8217;s usually given by injection.\nIt&#8217;s usually used if vulval cancer comes back or to control symptoms when a cure is not possible. Sometimes it may be combined with radiotherapy.\nThe medicines used in chemotherapy can sometimes damage healthy tissue, as well as the cancerous tissue. Side effects are common and include:\n- tiredness\n- feeling and being&nbsp;sick\n- hair thinning or&nbsp;hair&nbsp;loss\n- sore mouth and mouth ulcers&nbsp;\n- an increased risk of infections – tell your care team if you develop any symptoms of an infection, and try to avoid close contact with people known to have an infection\nThese side effects should pass once treatment has finished.\nRead more about the side effects of chemotherapy.&nbsp;\nThe emotional impact of living with vulval cancer can be significant. Many people report experiencing a kind of rollercoaster effect.

        "description": "Warts are small lumps that often develop on the skin of the hands and feet. They vary in appearance and may develop singly or in clusters.\nMost people will have warts at some point in their life. They tend to affect children and teenagers more than adults.\nSource:&nbsp;dermnetnz.org\nSource:&nbsp;dermnetnz.org\nWarts are caused by certain strains of the human papilloma virus (HPV).\nThere are lots of different strains of HPV and these cause different types of warts.\nHPV causes too much keratin (a hard protein) to develop in the top skin layer (epidermis). The extra keratin produces the rough, hard texture of a wart.\nHPV is passed on through close skin-to-skin contact. It can also be passed on indirectly by contact with contaminated objects like:\n- towels\n- shoes\n- areas surrounding swimming pools\n- the floors of communal changing areas\nYou&#8217;re more likely to get infected if your skin is wet or damaged.\nWarts can also be spread to other parts of your own body. You can spread the virus if you:\n- scratch, knock or bite a wart\n- bite your nails or suck your fingers (if they have warts on them)\n- shave your face or legs\nAfter you become infected, it can take weeks or even months for a wart or verruca to appear.\nWarts and verrucas aren&#8217;t usually serious and can be treated by a pharmacist.\nYour pharmacist will give you advice about the best treatment for you.\nThere are several different types of warts. These vary in size and shape.\nSource: dermnetnz.org\nIf you have a common wart, it will:\n- be round or oval-shaped\n- be firm and raised\n- have a rough, irregular surface\n- often develop on the knuckles, fingers and knees\n- vary in size, from less than 1mm to more than 10mm (1cm) in diameter\nYou may develop one common wart or several.\nSource:&nbsp;dermnetnz.org\nFiliform warts are long and slender in appearance. They often develop on the neck or face.\nMosaic warts grow in clusters and form a &#8217;tile-like&#8217; pattern. They often develop on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.\nSource:&nbsp;dermnetnz.org\nPeriungual warts develop under and around the fingernails or toenails. They:\n- have a rough surface\n- can affect the shape of the nail\n- can be painful\nSource:&nbsp;dermnetnz.org\nIt&#8217;s possible to have between one and several hundred plane warts, which can develop in clusters. They are usually:\n- a yellowish colour\n- smooth, round and flat-topped\n- 2 to 4mm in diameter\n- common in young children – mainly affecting the hands, face and legs\nPlane warts can sometimes develop on the lower legs of women. This is because the human papilloma virus (HPV) can be spread through shaving.\nVerrucas usually develop on the soles of the feet. The affected area of skin will be:\n- white, often with a black dot (blood vessel) in the centre\n- flat rather than raised\nVerrucas can sometimes be painful if they&#8217;re on a weight-bearing part of th\nWarts usually clear up without treatment.\nThe length of time it takes for a wart to disappear will vary from person to person. It can take up to 2 years for the virus to leave your system and for warts to disappear. Warts tend to last longer in older children and adults.\nLeaving the wart to go away by itself is one option. But, you may want to consider treatment if your wart is:\n- painful\n- in an awkward position\n- causing you distress or embarrassment\nA wart will sometimes return following treatment.\nCommon ways to treat warts and verrucas include:\n- salicylic acid – available from pharmacies in creams, gels, paints and medicated plasters\n- cryotherapy – liquid nitrogen is applied to the wart to freeze and destroy affected skin cells\n- chemical treatments – chemicals are applied to warts to kill affected skin cells\nSurgery is not usually recommended for warts.\nThere are steps you can take to lower your chances of getting warts, and prevent them spreading to others."

        "disease": "Wilms’ tumour",
        "description": "Wilms’ tumour is a type of kidney cancer in children. It most often affects children under the age of 5.\nMore children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past.\nIt is devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming. There are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time.\nUnderstanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. Your child’s specialist will give you more detailed information. If you have any questions it’s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child’s individual situation.\nWilms’ tumour is a type of kidney cancer that was named after Dr Max Wilms, who first described it. It’s thought to come from very specialised cells in the embryo known as metanephric blastema. These cells are involved in the development of the child’s kidneys while they are in the womb. The cells usually disappear at birth, but in many children with Wilms’ tumour, clusters of primitive kidneys cells, called nephrogenic rests can still be found.\nThe kidneys are a pair of organs found at the back of the abdomen. They clean the blood by removing excess fluids and waste products, which are then converted into urine.\nIn most children, the causes of Wilms’ tumour are unknown. Very rarely, people who develop Wilms’ tumour have other specific conditions which are present at birth (congenital malformations). These include the lack of an iris in the eye (aniridia), abnormalities of the genitals, and a condition where one side of the body is slightly larger than the other (hemihypertrophy).\nIn 1 in 100 people with Wilms’ tumour, another family member will also have Wilms’ tumour.\nThe most common symptom is a swollen abdomen, which is usually painless. Sometimes a parent or carer may feel a lump in the abdomen which can be quite large. Occasionally, the tumour may bleed slightly and this can irritate the kidney and may be painful. There may be blood in your child’s urine (pee), or their blood pressure may be raised. The child may also have a high temperature (fever), upset stomach, weight loss or a lack of appetite.\nA variety of tests and investigations may be needed to diagnose a Wilms’ tumour.\nAn abdominal ultrasound scan is usually the first thing that is done. This will be followed by an&nbsp;MRI&nbsp;and/or&nbsp;CT scan&nbsp;of the abdomen and chest. These scans help doctors to identify exactly where the tumour is and whether it has spread beyond the kidney. This is known as staging. Urine and blood samples will also be taken to check your child’s kidney function and general health. Most children will go on to have a&nbsp;biopsy, where a sample of tissue is taken from the tumour to confirm the diagnosis. Any tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you.\nThe stage of a cancer is a term used to describe its size and whether it has spread beyond its original site. Knowing the particular type and the stage of the cancer helps doctors decide on the most appropriate treatment.\nIn the case of a Wilms’ tumour, the stage is finalised after surgery to remove the tumour. As most Wilms’ tumour patients receive chemotherapy before surgery, you may not know the exact stage of your child’s tumour straight away. An exception is that babies under 6 months old usually have surgery straight away.\nThe tumour is only affecting the kidney and has not begun to spread. It can be completely removed with surgery.\nThe tumour has begun to spread beyond the kidney to nearby structures, but it’s still possible to remove it completely with surgery.\nThe tumour has spread beyond the kidney; either because the tumour has burst before (or during) the operation, has spread to lymph glands (nodes), or has not been completely removed by surgery.\nThe tumour has spread to other parts of the body such as the lungs or liver. Tumours in other parts of the body are known as metastases.\nThere are tumours in both kidneys (bilateral Wilms’ tumour).\nIf the tumour comes back after initial treatment, this is known as recurrent cancer or relapse.\nTreatment is planned by specialists in children’s tumours and cancers. This is usually based in a children’s oncology unit within a main hospital, but some treatment may be given closer to home.\nTreatment will depend on a number of factors including how the cells appear under the microscope (histology) and the stage of the tumour. Treatment may include chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery.\nAll children with Wilms’ tumour will have surgery. Initially, this may only involve taking a small sample of cells from the tumour to confirm the diagnosis. This is called a biopsy and is usually done under a general anaesthetic using a needle inserted through the skin.\nApart from very young children (under 6 months), most patients will receive chemotherapy before having a bigger operation to remove the entire tumour. The operation usually involves removing the whole of the affected kidney (nephrectomy).\nAfter examining the whole tumour under the microscope, Wilms’ tumours can be divided into a number of risk groups based on knowledge about how these different types of tumours are likely to behave. The treatment following surgery will depend on these risk groups. The risk groups are known as LOW, STANDARD (or INTERMEDIATE), and HIGH.\nThe majority of tumours are in the ‘standard risk’ group. So-called ‘low risk’ tumours require less treatment than standard risk tumours.\nTwo types of Wilms’ tumour – anaplastic and blastemal – are considered to be ‘higher risk’ than other Wilms’ tumours and require more intensive (stronger) chemotherapy.\nAbout 5% to 10% of Wilms’ tumours have an appearance called anaplasia, which means the cells look very disorganised under a microscope.\nThis group of high-risk tumours cannot be identified by looking at the biopsy because they occur when a particular type of early kidney cell survives the pre-surgery chemotherapy. These cells are known as blastemal cells. Tumours, where most of these cells survive chemotherapy, are called blastemal tumours.\nOther, less common types of kidney tumours may occur in children. These are usually only recognised after surgery to obtain a tumour sample. ‘Clear cell sarcoma’ and ‘malignant rhabdoid tumour’ of the kidney are 2 types of cancerous tumour, with their own treatment recommendations.\nCongenital mesoblastic nephroma is a non-cancerous (benign) tumour that occurs in very young children. This type of tumour usually only needs surgery and no other treatment.\nChemotherapy&nbsp;is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells. It’s usually given as an injection or drip into a vein (intravenously). Chemotherapy given before surgery is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\nWhat doctors find out about the tumour after surgery&nbsp;– for example, how the cells look under the microscope and how far the cancer has spread – helps them to decide whether additional chemotherapy should be given (adjuvant chemotherapy). This is to help reduce the risk of the cancer coming back (recurring). This chemotherapy may be given as inpatient or outpatient depending on tumour staging and risk group.\nRadiotherapy&nbsp;treats cancer by using high-energy rays to destroy the cancer cells, while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells.\nNot all children with Wilms’ tumour need radiotherapy. For those that do, the area to be treated depends on the stage of the tumour at diagnosis. Some children receive radiotherapy to the area around the affected kidney or, less commonly, to the whole abdomen. If the tumour has spread to the lungs, then lung radiotherapy may be needed but this depends on how well the cancer responds to initial chemotherapy; it’s not always needed.\nRadiotherapy may occasionally be used to shrink tumours that are too large to remove surgically. This will, ideally, allow an operation to be done. Radiotherapy can also be used when tumours have spread elsewhere in the body.\nIn about 1 in 20 cases, Wilms’ tumour affects both kidneys. Treatment usually involves surgery to both. The aim of the treatment is to remove as much of the cancer as possible, while leaving as much healthy kidney as possible. Chemotherapy is always given. Sometimes radiotherapy is needed as well.\nTreatment for Wilms’ tumour often causes side effects. Your child’s doctor will discuss this with you before treatment starts. Many side effects are expected and managed effectively. Side effects can include feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting), hair loss, bruising and bleeding, tiredness, diarrhoea, and an increased risk of infection. Less common effects may include impact on the heart, kidneys, and liver.\nA small number of children may develop late side effects, sometimes many years later. These include a possible reduction in bone growth, a change in the way the heart and lungs work, and a slight increase in their risk of developing another cancer in later life. Infertility is a possible late side effect, although this is rare.\nYour child’s doctor or nurse will talk to you about any possible late side effects. These will depend on the exact treatments given.\nMany children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness. The trial may include comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. It may just involve collecting patient and tumour details including response to treatment to increase specialists’ knowledge. If appropriate, your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial, and will answer any questions you have. Written information will be provided to help explain things.\nTaking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you will be given plenty of time to decide if it’s right for your child.\nSometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child’s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The&nbsp;Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group&nbsp;(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.\nMost children with Wilms’ tumour are cured. If the cancer comes back, it’s usually within the first 2 years. When one kidney is removed, the other will be able to work normally and can take over the work of the other kidney.\nVery few children have long-term kidney problems. Your child will have regular check-ups to look for any recurrence or problems following treatment.\nIf you have specific concerns about your child’s condition and treatment, it’s best to discuss them with your child’s doctor, who knows the situation in detail.\nAs a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time.\nYour child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer.\nFurther advice if your child has cancer"

        "disease": "Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome",
        "description": "Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) is most common in children who are born with a heart condition (congenital heart disease), but it can also occur in those without.\nIn the UK, between 1 and 3 people in every 1,000 are thought to have WPW syndrome\nMost people experience symptoms between the ages of 30 and 40.\nWPW syndrome is a condition that makes the heart suddenly beat abnormally fast, in an abnormal heart rhythm called supraventricular tachycardia (SVT).\nEpisodes can last for seconds, minutes, hours or, in rare cases, days.\nThe frequency with which episodes occur can vary from person to person. Some people might&nbsp;have episodes on a daily basis, whereas others&nbsp;may only experience them occasionally.\nChildren with&nbsp;the syndrome will often report having symptoms such as:\n- chest pain\n- palpitations\n- difficulty&nbsp;breathing\nAdults&nbsp;often experience symptoms such as a:\n- pounding heartbeat that occurs suddenly\n- pulse that&#8217;s too fast to count\n- reduced ability to tolerate activity\nIn rare cases of WPW syndrome, a person&#8217;s heart rate can increase significantly when a heart rhythm called&nbsp;atrial fibrillation occurs. The combination of the syndrome&nbsp;and atrial fibrillation can be life threatening and requires emergency assessment.\nWhen the heart beats normally, its muscular walls contract (tighten and squeeze) to force blood out and around the body. They then relax, allowing the heart to fill with blood again.\nIn WPW syndrome, electrical signals in the heart can travel&nbsp;round and round in a loop, causing the heart to beat very fast. The heart muscle contracts at such a fast rate that&nbsp;it has very little time to relax and fill with blood inbetween contractions.\nThis reduces the amount of blood being pumped around the body, which can give the symptoms of dizzy or light-headedness, shortness of breath, and faintness or fainting.\nIf a person known to have WPW syndrome collapses or faints then this is an emergency, which requires a 999 ambulance call.\nSomeone with&nbsp;the syndrome may have heart palpitations, where the heart feels like it&#8217;s pounding, fluttering or beating irregularly for&nbsp;a few seconds or minutes. They may not experience heart palpitations, and the syndrome may only be&nbsp;picked up if they&nbsp;have an electrocardiogram (ECG) for another reason.\nThe fast heart rate of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is caused by an extra electrical pathway in the heart.\nThis allows electrical signals to bypass the usual electrical system route and form a short circuit, resulting in an abnormally fast heart rhythm.\nThe extra electrical circuit is caused by a strand of muscle that grows from the atria to the ventricle when a foetus develops in the womb.\nThe syndrome rarely runs in families and usually occurs randomly in some babies.\nIf your GP thinks you might have Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome after assessing your symptoms, they&#8217;ll probably recommend that you have an electrocardiogram (ECG) and refer you to a cardiologist (heart specialist).\nAn ECG is a test that records your heart&#8217;s rhythm and electrical activity. Small discs called electrodes are stuck on your arms, legs and chest and connected by wires to an ECG machine.&nbsp;The machine records the tiny electrical signals produced by your heart each time it beats.\nIf you have WPW syndrome, the ECG will record a &#8220;delta wave&#8221;, which is an unusual wave pattern not usually present in people who don&#8217;t have the condition.\nCapturing an episode of a racing heart and palpitations using a normal ECG can often be difficult. This means that you might be asked to wear a small portable ECG recorder that will trace your heart rate continuously over 24 hours or when you switch it on at the start of an episode.\nIn many cases, episodes of abnormal heart activity associated with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome are harmless, don&#8217;t last long and settle down on their own without treatment.\nYou should go to your nearest hospital&#8217;s accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department if your heart beats abnormally fast for 20 minutes.\nYou&#8217;ll be given an intravenous (through your vein) ‘drip’ to slow your heart rate down.\nAnti-arrhythmic medicine or medication can often be used to prevent or manage a rapid heartbeat.\nIf medication proves ineffective, sometimes rebooting of the hearts electrical circuit is required and this is called electrical cardioversion.\nThe normal treatment for WPW is a catheter ablation. This is a procedure where the abnormal pathway is ablated (destroyed) using radio-frequency waves."

It&#8217;s also called uterine cancer and endometrial cancer.\nAbnormal vaginal bleeding is the most common symptom of womb cancer.\nIf you have been through the menopause, any vaginal bleeding is considered abnormal. If you have not yet been through the menopause, unusual bleeding may include bleeding between your periods.\nYou should speak to your GP as soon as possible if you experience any unusual vaginal bleeding. While it&#8217;s unlikely&nbsp;to be&nbsp;caused by womb cancer, it&#8217;s best to be sure.\nYour GP will examine you and ask about your symptoms.

Specifically, your risk is increased if you have high levels of a hormone called oestrogen in your body.\nA number of&nbsp;things can cause this hormone imbalance, including obesity, diabetes, and&nbsp;hormone replacement therapy (HRT).&nbsp;There is also a small increase in the risk of womb cancer with long-term use of the breast cancer drug tamoxifen.\nIt&#8217;s not always possible to prevent womb cancer, but some things are thought to reduce your risk. This includes maintaining a healthy weight and the long-term use of some types of contraception.\nRead more about the causes of womb cancer\nThe most common treatment for womb cancer is the surgical removal of the womb (hysterectomy).\nA hysterectomy can cure womb cancer in its early stages, but&nbsp;you&nbsp;will no longer be able to get pregnant.&nbsp;Surgery for womb cancer is also likely to include the removal of the ovaries and fallopian tubes.\nRadiotherapy or&nbsp;chemotherapy&nbsp;are also sometimes used, often in conjunction with surgery.\nA type of hormone therapy may be used if you are yet to go through the menopause and would still like to have children.\nEven if your cancer is advanced and the chances of a cure are small, treatment can still help to relieve symptoms and prolong your life.\nRead more about treating womb cancer\nLiving with cancer is challenging and womb cancer can affect your life in specific ways.\nFor example, your sex life may be affected if you have a hysterectomy. You may find it physically more difficult to have sex and have a reduced sex drive.\nYou may find it beneficial to talk to other people about your condition, including family members, your partner, or other people with womb cancer.\nRead more about living with womb cancer\nWomb cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer of the female reproductive system. It&#8217;s the fourth most common cancer diagnosed&nbsp;in women after breast cancer, lung cancer, and cancer of the colon and rectum.\nWomb cancer is more common in women and anyone with a womb who has been through the menopause. Most cases are diagnosed in women and anyone with a womb aged 40 to 74.\nThe most common symptom of womb cancer is abnormal bleeding from the vagina, although most people with abnormal bleeding don&#8217;t have cancer.\nBleeding may start as light bleeding accompanied by a watery discharge, which may get heavier over time. Most women and anyone with a womb diagnosed with womb cancer have been through the menopause, so any vaginal bleeding will be unusual.\nIn women and anyone with a womb who hasn&#8217;t been through the menopause, unusual vaginal bleeding may consist of:\n- periods that are heavier than usual\n- vaginal bleeding in between normal periods\nLess common symptoms include pain in the lower abdomen (tummy) and pain during sex.\nIf womb cancer reaches a more advanced stage, it may cause additional symptoms. These include:\n- pain in the back, legs, or pelvis\n- loss of appetite\n- tiredness\n- nausea\nIf you have&nbsp;postmenopausal vaginal bleeding, or notice a change in the normal pattern of your period, visit your GP.\nOnly&nbsp;1 in 10 cases of unusual vaginal bleeding after the menopause are caused by&nbsp;womb cancer, so it&#8217;s unlikely your symptoms&nbsp;will be caused by this condition.\nHowever, if you have unusual vaginal bleeding, it&#8217;s important to get the cause of your symptoms investigated.&nbsp;The bleeding may be the result of a number of other potentially serious health conditions, such as:\n- endometriosis&nbsp;– where tissue that behaves like the lining of the womb is found on the outside of the womb\n- fibroids&nbsp;– non-cancerous growths that can develop inside the uterus\n- polyps in the womb lining\nOther types of gynaecological cancer can also&nbsp;cause unusual&nbsp;vaginal bleeding, particularly cervical cancer.\nIt&#8217;s not known exactly what causes womb cancer, but certain things can increase your risk of developing it.\nCancer begins with a change (mutation) in the structure of the DNA in cells, which can affect how they grow. This means cells grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour.\nIf left untreated, cancer can grow and spread to other parts of your body, either directly or through the blood and lymphatic system.\nA number of things have been identified that&nbsp;increase the risk of developing&nbsp;womb cancer.&nbsp;\nThe risk of developing&nbsp;womb cancer increases with age. The majority of cases&nbsp;occur in women and anyone with a womb aged 40 to 74.\nThe risk of developing womb cancer is linked to the body&#8217;s&nbsp;exposure to oestrogen. Oestrogen is one of the hormones that regulate the reproductive system.\n- oestrogen stimulates the release of eggs from your ovaries and causes the cells of the&nbsp;womb lining to divide\n- progesterone gets the lining of your uterus ready to receive the egg from the ovaries\nThe levels of oestrogen and progesterone in your body are usually balanced with each other. If oestrogen isn&#8217;t kept in balance by progesterone, the level in the body can increase. This is called unopposed oestrogen.\nAfter the menopause, the body stops producing progesterone. However, there are still small amounts of oestrogen being produced. This unopposed oestrogen causes the cells of the endometrium to divide, which&nbsp;can increase the risk of&nbsp;womb cancer.\nBecause of the link between increased levels of unopposed oestrogen and&nbsp;womb cancer, oestrogen-only&nbsp;hormone replacement therapy (HRT) should only be given to those who have had their womb surgically removed (hysterectomy).\nIn all other cases, both oestrogen and progesterone (combination HRT) must be used in HRT to reduce the risk of womb cancer.\nAs oestrogen can be produced in fatty tissue, being overweight or obese&nbsp;increases the level of oestrogen in your body. This significantly increases your chances of developing womb cancer.\nWomen and anyone with a womb who is overweight is 3&nbsp;times more likely to develop womb cancer compared with those who are a healthy weight.&nbsp;\nOne way to assess whether your weight is healthy is to understand&nbsp;your healthy body mass index (BMI).&nbsp;\nWomen and anyone with a womb who has not had children are at a higher risk of&nbsp;womb cancer. This may be because the increased levels of progesterone and decreased levels of oestrogen that occur during pregnancy&nbsp;have a protective effect on the lining of the womb.\nWomen and anyone with a womb who are treated with tamoxifen (a hormone treatment for breast cancer) can be at an increased risk of developing womb cancer. However, this risk is outweighed by the benefits that tamoxifen provides in preventing breast cancer.\nIt&#8217;s important to visit your GP if you&#8217;re taking tamoxifen and experience any abnormal vaginal bleeding.\nWomen and anyone with a womb with&nbsp;diabetes&nbsp;are twice as likely to develop womb cancer as those without the condition.\nDiabetes causes an increase in the amount of insulin in your body, which in turn can raise your oestrogen levels.\nMany women and anyone with ovaries with type 2 diabetes are also overweight, which further increases the risk.\nWomen and anyone with ovaries with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) are at a higher risk of developing womb cancer, as they have high levels of oestrogen in their bodies.\nPCOS can cause symptoms such as irregular or light periods, or no periods at all, as well as&nbsp;problems getting pregnant, weight gain, acne, and excessive hair growth (hirsutism).\nEndometrial hyperplasia is when the lining of the womb becomes thicker. It&nbsp;may be increase risk of developing&nbsp;womb cancer.\nYou should visit your GP if you have abnormal vaginal bleeding. While it&#8217;s unlikely to be caused by womb cancer, it&#8217;s best to be sure.\nYour GP will probably carry out a physical examination of your pelvic area, including your vagina, womb, ovaries, and bladder. They will ask about your symptoms, when they happen, and how often.\nYou may be referred to a specialist in conditions of the female reproductive organs (a gynaecologist) for further tests.\nIn 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of gynaecological cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected endometrial cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral.\nAnother test you may have is called a transvaginal ultrasound (TVU). TVU is a type of&nbsp;ultrasound scan that uses a small scanner in the form of a probe.\nThis is placed directly into the vagina to obtain a detailed picture of the inside of the uterus. The probe can feel a little uncomfortable, but shouldn&#8217;t be painful.\nThe TVU checks whether there are any changes to the thickness of the lining of your uterus that could be caused by the presence of cancerous cells.\nIf the results of the TVU detect changes in the thickness of the lining of the uterus, you will usually have a&nbsp;biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.\nIn&nbsp;a biopsy, a small sample of cells is taken from the lining of the womb (the endometrium). The sample is then checked at a laboratory for the presence of cancerous cells.\nThe biopsy can be carried out in&nbsp;several ways, including:\n- aspiration biopsy – a small flexible tube is inserted into your vagina and up into your womb, and then sucks up a small sample of cells\n- hysteroscopy – this allows the doctor to look at the inside of the womb using a thin type of telescope called a hysteroscope, which is inserted through your vagina and into your womb, allowing the doctor to look at the lining of the womb and take a sample from it\nIn some cases, a hysteroscopy&nbsp;may be used before dilatation and curettage (D&amp;C). D&amp;C is a minor surgical procedure&nbsp;carried out under general anaesthetic,&nbsp;where some tissue from the womb lining is removed. The tissue&nbsp;is then sent off to a laboratory for further testing.\nA blood test can sometimes help diagnose womb cancer. This is because some cancerous tumours release certain chemicals into your blood, known as tumour markers, which can be detected during a blood test.\nHowever, this type of test isn&#8217;t very reliable. The presence of these chemicals doesn&#8217;t mean you definitely have womb cancer. Some people with womb cancer don&#8217;t have these chemicals in their blood.\nIf you&#8217;re diagnosed with womb cancer, you may have further tests&nbsp;to help determine the stage of the cancer. Staging the cancer will allow the doctors to work out how large the cancer is, whether or not it has spread, and the best treatment options for you.\nThese tests may include:\n- a&nbsp;chest X-ray&nbsp;– where radiation is used to check if the cancer has spread to the lungs\n- magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&nbsp;– where magnetic fields are used to create a&nbsp;detailed image of the inside of your body&nbsp;to check if the cancer has spread\n- a computerised tomography (CT) scan&nbsp;– where a series of X-rays are used to create a detailed image of the inside of your body&nbsp;to check if the cancer has spread\n- further blood tests –&nbsp;these are usually done&nbsp;to check your general health and how well some of your organs are functioning\nRead treating womb cancer for more information about staging.\nHealth professionals use a staging system to describe how far womb cancer has advanced. These stages are:\n- stage 1 –&nbsp;the cancer is still contained inside the womb (uterus)\n- stage 2 – the cancer has spread to the neck of the womb (the cervix)\n- stage 3 –&nbsp;the cancer has spread outside the womb into nearby tissues in the pelvis or the lymph nodes\n- stage 4 –&nbsp;the cancer has spread to the soft tissues of the abdomen, or into other organs, such as the bladder, bowel, liver, or lungs\nYour chances of surviving womb cancer depend on the stage at which it&#8217;s diagnosed.\nThe main treatment for womb cancer is to remove the womb (hysterectomy), together with the ovaries and fallopian tubes. This is sometimes followed by radiotherapy or chemotherapy&nbsp;to try to kill any possible remaining cancer cells, depending on the stage and grade of the cancer.\nHaving a hysterectomy means you will&nbsp;no longer be&nbsp;able to get pregnant. Younger women who haven&#8217;t already reached the menopause may not want to have their womb and ovaries removed if they wish to have children.\nIn this case, under very specific circumstances it may be possible to treat the cancer using hormone therapy.\nAdvanced womb cancer&nbsp;requires a different course of treatment, usually depending more on chemotherapy.\nAdvanced cancer may not be curable, but the treatment aims to achieve a remission, where the cancer shrinks, making you feel normal and able to enjoy life to the full.\nEven if there&#8217;s no chance of a cure, surgery may be carried out to remove as much of the cancer as possible.\nRadiotherapy, chemotherapy or hormone therapy can reduce symptoms such as pain by shrinking the cancer or slowing its growth.\nIf you have stage&nbsp;1 cancer, you&#8217;ll probably have a hysterectomy. This involves removing both ovaries and the fallopian tubes in a procedure called a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), as well as&nbsp;the uterus (hysterectomy).\nThe surgeon may also take samples from the lymph nodes in the pelvis and abdomen and other nearby tissue. These will be sent to the laboratory to see whether the cancer has spread.\nThe most common hysterectomy technique involves using one large cut across your tummy to access the womb and remove it.\nIt&#8217;s sometimes possible to use a technique called a laparoscopic hysterectomy, also known as a&nbsp;keyhole hysterectomy. This involves using several small cuts so a special type of telescope (laparoscope) and other surgical instruments&nbsp;can be used.\nThis&nbsp;means the surgeon&nbsp;can see inside your body and remove your womb through your vagina with little scarring.\nYou&#8217;ll probably be ready to go home 3&nbsp;to 5&nbsp;days after your operation, or less if you had keyhole surgery. But it can take many weeks to recover fully.\nAfter your operation, you&#8217;ll be encouraged to start moving about as soon as possible. This is very important, and even if you have to stay in bed you&#8217;ll need to keep doing regular leg movements to help your circulation and prevent blood clots. You&#8217;ll be shown exercises by the nurses or physiotherapist to help prevent complications.\nWhen you go home, you&#8217;ll need to exercise gently to build up your strength and fitness. Discuss with your doctor or physiotherapist which types of exercise would be suitable for you.\nIf you have stage&nbsp;2 or&nbsp;3 womb cancer and the cancer has spread to the cervix or nearby lymph nodes in the pelvis, you may have a radical or total hysterectomy.\nThis involves the additional removal of the cervix and the top of your vagina, as well as the removal of the pelvic lymph nodes. You may also need radiotherapy or chemotherapy treatment after surgery to reduce the risk&nbsp;of the cancer returning.\nIf you have advanced womb cancer, you may have surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible. This is called debulking surgery.\nThis won&#8217;t cure the cancer, but it may ease some of the symptoms. Your doctor will discuss whether debulking surgery is suitable for you.\nA course of&nbsp;radiotherapy will be recommended if your treatment team thinks there&#8217;s a significant risk the cancer could return in the pelvis. Radiotherapy may also be used to slow the spread of cancer when a surgical cure is not possible.\nThere are 2&nbsp;types of radiotherapy used to treat&nbsp;womb cancer:\n- internal radiotherapy (also known as brachytherapy)&nbsp;– where&nbsp;a plastic tube is inserted inside the uterus and radiation treatment is passed down the tube into the womb\n- external radiotherapy –&nbsp;where&nbsp;a machine is used to deliver pulses of radiation to your pelvis\nA course of external radiotherapy is usually given to you as an outpatient for 5&nbsp;days a week with a break at the weekend. The treatment takes a few minutes. The whole course of radiotherapy may last approximately 4&nbsp;weeks depending on the stage and position of the womb cancer.\nSome women and anyone with a womb have internal radiotherapy (brachytherapy) as well as external radiotherapy. During brachytherapy, the device that delivers radiation is placed in your vagina.\nThere are different types of brachytherapy, involving either low, medium, or high dose rates. With low dose rate methods the radiation is delivered more slowly, so the device has to stay inside you for longer. You&#8217;ll have to stay in hospital while you have the treatment. Your doctor will discuss this with you.\nRadiotherapy has some side effects. Skin in the treated area can become red and sore, and hair loss may occur. Radiotherapy to the pelvic area can affect the bowel and cause sickness and diarrhoea.\nAs your course of treatment progresses, you&#8217;re likely to get very tired. Most of these side effects will go away when your treatment finishes.\nIf you have stage&nbsp;3 or&nbsp;4&nbsp;womb cancer, you may be given a course of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy can be used after surgery to try to prevent the return of the cancer. In cases of advanced cancer, it may be used to slow the spread of the cancer and relieve symptoms.\nChemotherapy is usually given as an injection into the vein (intravenously). You&#8217;ll usually be able to go home the same day you have chemotherapy, but sometimes you may need a short stay in hospital.\nChemotherapy is usually given in cycles, with a period of treatment being followed by a period of rest to allow the body to recover.\nSide effects of chemotherapy can include:\n- nausea\n- vomiting\n- hair loss&nbsp;\n- fatigue\nThere is also an increased risk of an infection developing in your bloodstream (sepsis), as your body&#8217;s ability to fight infection is reduced by chemotherapy.\nThe side effects should stop once treatment has finished.\nSome&nbsp;womb cancers are affected by the female hormone oestrogen. These cancers may respond to treatment with hormone therapy. Your doctor will discuss&nbsp;whether this is a possible treatment for your&nbsp;womb cancer.\nHormone therapy&nbsp;usually&nbsp;replaces&nbsp;a hormone called progesterone, which naturally occurs in your body. Artificial progesterone is used and is&nbsp;usually given as tablets.\nIt&#8217;s mainly used to treat advanced-stage&nbsp;womb cancers, or cancer that has come back, and can help shrink the tumour and control any symptoms.\nThe treatment may have some side effects, including mild nausea, mild muscle cramps, and weight gain. Your doctor will discuss these with you.\nA lot of progress has been made in the treatment of womb cancer. More people are living longer with fewer side effects. Some of these advances were discovered through clinical trials,&nbsp;where new treatments and combinations of treatments are compared with standard treatment.\nAll cancer clinical trials in the UK are carefully monitored to make sure the trial is worthwhile and safely conducted. Participants in clinical trials often do better overall than those in routine care.\nIf you&#8217;re invited to take part in a trial, you&#8217;ll be given an information sheet. If you wish to take part, you&#8217;ll be asked to sign your consent. You&#8217;re always free to refuse or withdraw from a clinical trial without it affecting your care.\nWomen and anyone with a womb with womb cancer usually have a hysterectomy. This can be a major operation, and recovery may take&nbsp;from&nbsp;6 to 12 weeks.\nDuring this time you will have to avoid lifting things (for example, children and heavy shopping bags) and doing heavy housework. You won&#8217;t be able to drive for between 3&nbsp;and 8&nbsp;weeks after the operation.\nMost people need&nbsp;4 to&nbsp;12 weeks off work after a hysterectomy. The recovery time will depend on the type of surgery you have, whether or not&nbsp;any problems develop, and what type of work you will return to.\nSome of the treatments for endometrial cancer, particularly radiotherapy, can make you very tired. You may need to take a break from some of your normal activities for a while. Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask for practical help from family and friends if you need it.\nAfter your course of treatment has finished, you&#8217;ll probably be invited back for regular check-ups. At the check-up, your doctor will examine you (this is likely to include an internal examination) and possibly carry out blood tests or scans to see how your cancer is responding to treatment.\nKnowing how to talk to your friends and family about your cancer can be difficult, and they may find it hard to talk to you, too. People deal with serious problems in different ways.\nIt&#8217;s hard to predict how a diagnosis of cancer will affect you. Being open and honest about how you feel and what your family and friends can do to help&nbsp;may put them at ease. But don&#8217;t feel shy about telling people that you want some time to yourself, if that&#8217;s what you need.\nWomb&nbsp;cancer and its treatment can affect your sex life. This can happen in several ways.\nIf you haven&#8217;t already had the menopause, removing the ovaries means you&#8217;ll go through an early menopause. Symptoms can include vaginal dryness and loss of sexual desire.\nRadiotherapy for endometrial cancer can make your vagina narrower and less flexible. Sometimes the vagina gets so narrow that having sex becomes difficult. To stop this happening, you should be offered a set of vaginal dilators, which are plastic cones you put into your vagina to stretch it. You can also stretch your vagina by having sex, or by using your fingers or a vibrator.\nIt&#8217;s common to lose interest in sex after treatment for&nbsp;womb cancer. Your treatment may leave you feeling very tired. You may feel shocked, confused or depressed about being diagnosed with cancer, and you also&nbsp;may be grieving the loss of your fertility.\nIt&#8217;s understandable that you may not feel like having sex while having to cope with all this. Try to share your feelings with your partner. If you feel you have problems with sex that aren&#8217;t getting better with time, you may want to speak to a counsellor or a sex therapist.\nBeing diagnosed with cancer can be hard, both for patients and their families. You&#8217;ll need to deal with the emotional and practical difficulties.\nWith&nbsp;womb cancer, you have to cope physically with recovering from a hysterectomy, as well as&nbsp;the possible emotional impact of losing your womb.\nYounger women may have to face the fact they won&#8217;t be able to have children and all the grief and anger that may cause.\nOften, it can help to discuss your feelings and other difficulties with a trained counsellor or therapist. You can ask for this kind of help at any stage of your illness. There are various ways&nbsp;to find help and support:\n- your hospital doctor, specialist nurse or GP can refer you to a counsellor\n- if you&#8217;re struggling with feelings of depression, talk to your GP&nbsp;–&nbsp;a course of&nbsp;antidepressant drugs may be helpful, or your GP can arrange for you to get help from a counsellor or psychotherapist\n- it may be helpful to talk to someone who&#8217;s had the same experience as you – many organisations have telephone helplines and forums that may be useful to you, and they can put you in touch with other people who have been through cancer treatment\nIf you have to reduce or stop work because of your cancer, you may find it hard to cope financially. If you have cancer or you are caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to financial support.\n- if you have a job but can&#8217;t work because of your illness, you&#8217;re entitled to&nbsp;Statutory Sick Pay from your employer\n- if you don&#8217;t have a job and can&#8217;t work because of your illness, you may be entitled to Employment and Support Allowance&nbsp;\n- if you&#8217;re caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to Carer&#8217;s Allowance&nbsp;&nbsp;\n- you may be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home, or you have a low household income\nFind out what help is available to you&nbsp;early on. You can ask to speak to the social worker at your hospital, who can give you the information you need.\nRead further information:\n- Find your nearest Citizens Advice Scotland\n- GOV.UK: Benefits\n- Macmillan Cancer Support: Money, finance and insurance\n- Money Helper\nIf you&#8217;re told nothing more can be done to treat your womb cancer, your care will focus on controlling your symptoms and helping you to be as comfortable as possible. This is called palliative care. Palliative care also includes psychological, social and spiritual support for you and your family or carers.\nRead further information:\n- Palliative care\n- Marie Curie"

        "disease": "Wrist fracture",
        "description": "This information is for anyone who has a wrist fracture that doesn&#8217;t require surgery.\nYour injury may be referred to as a fracture, break or crack. These terms all mean the same thing.\nWhen you have a fracture, it&#8217;s not just the bone that&#8217;s affected. You&#8217;ll also have injured some of the soft tissues around it. Soft tissues include the:\n- muscles\n- ligaments\n- tendons\n- nerves\nAfter a wrist fracture, most of the healing happens between 6 to 12 weeks.\nIt&#8217;s normal to have aches and discomfort beyond this. This often happens when you try activities you haven’t done for a while.\nIt&#8217;s also normal for the area to be more sensitive for several months after the injury.\nThere are some things that might affect your recovery.\nSmoking affects all your tissues and slows facture healing times. In some people, it can stop healing altogether.\nStopping smoking as your fracture heals will help to ensure the best recovery.\nGet help to stop smoking.\nSome medical conditions, like diabetes, may slow down the healing process.\nEating a healthy diet and keeping yourself active will help your recovery.\nSome medications can slow down fracture healing. If you have concerns about your medication talk to a healthcare professional.\nAnti-inflammatory medication, like Ibuprofen or Naproxen, has been shown to delay healing.\nA wrist fracture can be debilitating as you can’t use your hand normally.\nDepending on the type of fracture you have, you may be immobilised in a cast or a wrist splint.\nIf you&#8217;ve been given a splint, you can remove it for hygiene purposes. For example, to allow you to shower or bathe.\nIf the splint is no longer fitting well please contact your fracture clinic.\nFurther information on having a cast fitted or removed.\nThere are things you can do to help your recovery after a wrist fracture.\nJust after your injury, you should:\n- maintain your shoulder and elbow movements\n- keep your fingers and thumb moving by regularly opening and closing your hand to make a fist\n- manage your pain and swelling\nAt this time, you&#8217;ll come out of your splint or cast. It&#8217;s not unusual to be stiff when your cast or splint is removed.\nYou can start gentle exercises,&nbsp;as guided by your healthcare professional.\nAs your injury recovers, you can begin to:\n- return to full function\n- resume normal day to day activity\n- gradually increase the amount of weight you&#8217;re carrying\n- return to contact sports at 12 weeks\nYou can start exercises for your wrist once advised by your healthcare professional.\nStop exercising if it makes your symptoms worse, or if it causes new pain.\nIf your wrist function hasn’t improved within 6 weeks of following this advice, it’s a good idea to talk to a healthcare professional about your symptoms.\nIt&#8217;s normal to have some discomfort in the areas around your fracture. The areas affected can be:\n- other soft tissues\n- nearby joints\n- areas that have been immobilised\nPain can change from day to day and it doesn’t always depend on what you&#8217;re doing. It&#8217;s common to have pain at rest.\nIt&#8217;s normal to have some pain even when your fracture has healed. Some people also experience discomfort in the fracture site during colder weather.\nYour local pharmacy can give you advice on managing pain after a fracture.\nUse Scotland&#8217;s Service Directory to find your local pharmacy.\nIt&#8217;s normal to have swelling near the fracture site. It often spreads down your arm.\nSwelling can sometimes last for months. The amount of swelling can also change depending on:\n- your position\n- your activity\n- the time of day\nIt&#8217;s important that swelling is managed well to help your recovery.\nHaving a lot of swelling can become uncomfortable or limit your movement. To help reduce the swelling you can try to:\n- raise your arm above your heart when resting &#8211; you can do this by supporting it with pillows\n- keep the other joints in your arm moving normally\n- find a balance between rest and activity\n- use self-massage to decrease swelling &#8211; if you&#8217;re able to, direct the massage from your fingertips towards&nbsp; your elbow\nIt&#8217;s normal to have bruising after a fracture.\nBruising can be widespread and may appear a long way from your fracture. It can be very purple to start with and may change colour as you recover.\nIn general, you should pace yourself when it comes to getting back to normal activities. Only do things as you feel able.\nYou should contact your insurance provider before driving as your injury may affect your insurance.\nOnce you&#8217;re out of your splint, the general advice is that you must be able to safely perform an emergency stop or manoeuvre.\nYou should always be in full control of your vehicle.\nYour return to work will depend on the type of work you do and your employer. It may be possible to discuss a phased return to work or changed duties.\nYou don’t need to see a healthcare professional to return to work.\nKeep doing any activities you&#8217;re able to, as your pain allows. Over time, gradually increase what you do.\nReduced flexibility and strength may make things more difficult to start with. This will get better as you slowly build up to all your usual activities.\nFrustration or low mood after an injury is normal. As you get back to normal life this should get better.\nLoss of confidence is common after a fracture.\nFurther advice about preventing falls.\nYou may be sent a letter inviting you for a scan of your bone density after a fracture.\nIt&#8217;s routine to be assessed for any further risk of fracture, especially if you:\n- are over the age of 50\n- have increased risk factors for fracture"

        "disease": "Yellow fever",
        "description": "Yellow fever is a serious viral infection that is spread by certain types of mosquito. It’s mainly found in sub-Saharan Africa, South America and parts of the Caribbean.\nThe condition can be prevented with a vaccination and is a very rare cause of illness in travellers.\nBetween 1999 and 2018, there were&nbsp;12 cases of yellow fever reported among European travellers. None of these travellers were vaccinated, 5 of these cases occurred in 2018.\nIf you&#8217;re planning to visit places where yellow fever infection is found, you should seek travel health advice before you travel. A map and list of countries where yellow fever is found is available on the NHS Fit for Travel website.\nThe virus that causes yellow fever is passed to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes. The mosquitoes that spread the infection are usually active and bite during daylight hours, and are found in both urban and rural areas.\nYellow fever can’t be passed directly from person to person through close contact.\nThe symptoms of yellow fever occur in 2 stages. The initial symptoms develop 3 to 6 days after infection, and can include:\n- a high temperature (fever)\n- a headache\n- nausea or vomiting\n- muscle pain, including backache\n- loss of appetite\nThis stage will usually pass after 3 to 4 days and most people will make a full recovery.\nHowever, around 15% of people go on to develop more serious problems, including jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes), kidney failure and bleeding from the mouth, nose, eyes or stomach (causing blood in your vomit and stools).\nUp to half of those who experience these symptoms will die.\nYou should see a doctor as soon as possible if you develop symptoms of yellow fever and are currently travelling in an area where the virus is found, or have recently returned from one of these areas.\nTo help determine whether you have yellow fever, the doctor will want to know exactly where you have been travelling and what symptoms you have. A blood test&nbsp;will be needed to confirm the diagnosis.\nThere is no specific treatment for yellow fever, but you will be monitored and the symptoms can be treated.\nYou will be admitted to hospital for assessment and supportive care.\nThe yellow fever vaccine protects you from infection when you travel to a country where yellow fever virus occurs and prevents the disease from spreading between countries.\nAfter you have received the vaccine you are given a yellow fever vaccine certificate to prove that you have received the vaccine and are protected from infection. This certificate is designed to fit inside your passport and is valid for life.\nThe countries that require proof of vaccination are those where either the disease occurs, or where it could occur because they have the correct mosquito and monkey species that could harbour the infection.\nMore about the yellow fever vaccine\nFind your nearest yellow fever vaccination centre\nIf you have yellow fever, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).\nThis helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.\nFind out more about the register."

        "disease": "Zika virus",
        "description": "Zika virus disease is caused by the Zika virus. For most people, it causes a very mild infection and no long-term problems.\nHowever, it may be harmful in pregnancy as it can lead to complications and birth defects in the baby. In particular, abnormally small heads (microcephaly).\nZika virus does not naturally occur in the UK.\nZika virus has been reported in the following areas:\n- Africa\n- Asia\n- Australia and the Pacific region\n- Caribbean\n- Central America\n- South America\n- North America\nMost people don&#8217;t have any symptoms when they are infected with Zika virus. If symptoms do occur, they are usually mild and start 3 to 14 days after the infection has been caught.
